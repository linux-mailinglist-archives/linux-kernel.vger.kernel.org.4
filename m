This should be an option via kernel command line if at all possible as soon
as possible because if issues like fragmentation show up as highlighted by
Vlastimil, then there will be need to do a comparison.  Furthermore, while
boot time is the primary focus of this series, it ignores ramp-up time of
an application that ultimately uses a high percentage of memory. A latency
sensitive application that stalls while accepting memory during ramp-up
may be more undesirable than a long boot time because it's unpredictable.
While it's not exactly the same, sometimes similar happens for ext4 for
lazy inode init after filesystem creation and this feature can be disabled
because it screws with benchmarks based on fresh filesystems. That problem
only happens on every filesystem init though, not every boot.

This is not necessarily true, while the background thread (or threads,
one per zone using one local CPU) are running an allocation request
could block on a waitqueue until the background thread makes progress.
That means the application would only stall if the background thread
is too slow or there are too many allocation requests. With that setup,
it would be possible that an application never blocks on accepting memory.

And this is the primary disadvantage between 2 and 3, stalls are guaranteed
for some allocating tasks until all memory is accepted.

accept_memory is introduced later in the series and it's an arch-specfic
decision on what range to accept. pageblock order would be the miminum
to help fragmentation avoidance but MAX_ORDER-1 would make more sense.
MAX_ORDER-1 would amortise the cost of acceptance, reduce potential issues
with fragmentation and reduce the total number of stalls required to
accept memory. The minimum range to accept should be generically enforced
in accept_memory that calls arch_accept_memory with the range. accept_page
-> accept_memory is fine but the core->arch_specific divide should be clear.

If MAX_ORDER-1 ranges were accepted at a time, it could be documented that the
list_head only contains orders of pages of a fixed size.

Aside from what Vlastimil said, it's not commented *why* these VM_BUG_ON_PAGE
(or WARN) could trigger and why Unevitable specifically. It could be a long
time after these patches are merged before they are used in production so if
it does happen, it'd be nice to have a comment explaining why it could occur.

If pages are accepted in MAX_ORDER-1 ranges enforced by the core, it'll
not be necessary to check ranges as 1 page will be enough to know the
whole block needs to be accepted.

Generically enforce a minimum range -- MAX_ORDER-1 recommended.

Probably could check this first locklessly as unaccepted pages only go down,
never up unless memory hotplug is a factor?

If blocks are released in fixed sizes or MAX_ORDER-1 then order is
irrelevant.

As is the migration type because the migration type will become the type
that splits at least a pageblock for the first time.

If accept_page returns the first struct page of the block freed then this
can be simplified. The corner case for zone boundaries or holes within a zone
that are not MAX_ORDER-1 should be accepted unconditionally in early boot.

Regardless of forced alignment, this should be a WARN_ON and bail. It's most
likely early in boot and if it affects 1 machine, it'll happen every time.

Enforcing alignment would also simplify fragmentation handling here.

If MAX_ORDER-1 is the minimum for acceptance then this changes. It would
have to be checked if this is a zone boundary and if so, accept the
pages immediately with a comment, otherwise add a MAX_ORDER-1 page to the
unaccepted list.

This is a potential fragmentation hazard because by the time this
is reached, the watermarks are low. By then, pageblocks potentially
became mixed due to __rmqueue_fallback and the mixing of blocks may be
persistent. __rmqueue_fallback should fail if there is still unaccepted
memory.

That said, what you have here is fine, it's just not enough to avoid
the hazard on its own.

This has a similar problem, fallbacks could have already occurred. By
forbidding fallbacks until all memory within a zone is accepted, this
should be less of an issue because NULL will be returned, more memory is
accepted and it retries. It'll be a little race prone as another request
could allocate the newly accepted memory before the retry but it would
eventually be resolved.

Vlastimil was correct in terms of how to gauge how serious fragmentation
issues are early-on. Tracking /proc/pagetypeinfo helps but is hard to
use because it has no information on mixed pageblocks. It's better to
track mm_page_alloc_extfrag and at the very least, count the number of
times this happens when all memory is accepted up-front versus deferred
acceptance. Any major difference in counts is potentially problematic.

At the very least, a kernel build with all CPUs early in boot would be a
start. Slightly better would be to run the number of a number of separate
kernel builds that uses a high percentage of memory. As the allocations
are a good mix, but short-lived, it would also help to run fio in the
background creating many 4K files to overally generate a mix of page
tables allocations, slab and movable allocs, some of which are short-lived
from kernbench and others that are more persisent due to fio. I don't
have something suitable automated in mmtests at the moment as it's been
a while since I investigated fragmentation specifically and the old tests
took too long to complete on larger systems.
