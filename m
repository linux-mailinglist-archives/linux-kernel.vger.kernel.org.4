But what should happen if the immediate demotion target is full but
lower tiers are still usable. Should the first one demote before
allowing to demote from the top tier?

OK, so what is the exact semantic of the node mask. Does it control
where to demote from or to or both?

That would require a nodemask to say which nodes to reclaim, no? The
default behavior should be in line with what standard memory reclaim
does. If the demotion is a part of that process so should be
memory.reclaim part of it. If we want to have a finer control then a
nodemask is really a must and then the nodemaks should constrain both
agining and reclaim.

Please keep in mind that the interface should be really prepared for
future extensions so try to abstract from your immediate usecases.

Is there any strong reason for that? We do not have any interface to
control NUMA balancing from userspace. Why cannot we use the interface
for that purpose?
