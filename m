I believe there are two reasons I'm Cc'ed now:
- the Cc was forgotten. because I remember reviewing some parts
  of this contribution
- this conflicts (to some extent) with my patch that speeds up
  the scrolling

For the first it's obvious what to do, I think Markuss can include me
in his v4.

For the second I don't see the functional clash. The scrolling in this
series is not anyhow optimized. I think my patch should go first as
- it is less intrusive
- it has been tested, or can be tested easily

Tell me if I'm missing something here.
