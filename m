> Sorry for the confusion at my side; `.word` certainly works, what doesn't work currently seems to be the `parse_r` helper. I know because I've tried in the last week with latest LLVM/Clang snapshot. And you can't write ergonomic inline asm with proper register allocator awareness without the helper; the LoongArch assembler isn't capable of assembling in a certain encoding format. With RISC-V `.insn` you can do things like `.insn r 0xNN, 0, 0, a0, a1, a2`, but you cannot simply e.g. express gcsrxchg with `.insn DJK 0x05000000, a0, a1, a2` because no such instruction format convention has been standardized. (The notation demonstrated here is taken from [1].)

I hate parse_r helper also, it is hard to understand, the kernel about
LoongArch has the same issue. How about using a fixed register like this?

/* GCSR */
static __always_inline u64 gcsr_read(u32 reg)
{
	u64 val = 0;

	BUILD_BUG_ON(!__builtin_constant_p(reg));
	/* Instructions will be available in binutils later */
	asm volatile (
		"parse_r __reg, %[val]\n\t"
		/*
		 * read val from guest csr register %[reg]
		 * gcsrrd %[val], %[reg]
		 */
		".word 0x5 << 24 | %[reg] << 10 | 0 << 5 | __reg\n\t"
		: [val] "+r" (val)
		: [reg] "i" (reg)
		: "memory");

	return val;
}

/* GCSR */
static __always_inline u64 gcsr_read(u32 reg)
{
        register unsigned long val asm("t0");

        BUILD_BUG_ON(!__builtin_constant_p(reg));
        /* Instructions will be available in binutils later */
        asm volatile (
                "parse_r __reg, %[val]\n\t"
                /*
                 * read val from guest csr register %[reg]
                 * gcsrrd %[val], %[reg]
                 */
                ".word 0x5 << 24 | %[reg] << 10 | 0 << 5 | 12 \n\t"
                : : [reg] "i" (reg)
                : "memory", "t0");

        return val;
}

> In any case, it seems best to at least wait for the documentation release a little bit, or you should state clearly that this is not going to happen soon, so people can properly manage their expectation and prioritize. (For example, if I know docs and/or assembler support for the virtualization extension won't come soon, then I'd work on supporting the .word idiom before other things. Otherwise there are more important things than that.)
