Thanks.  Please include this information in future versions of the patch series.

For device 2 I have strongly recommended using pre-boot apply of the overlay to the base
device tree.  I realize that this suggestion is only a partial solution if one wants to
use hotplug to change system configuration (as opposed to using hotplug only to replace
an existing device (eg a broken device) with another instance of the same device).  I
also realize that this increased the system administration overhead.  On the other hand
an overlay based solution is likely to be fragile and possibly flaky.

I looked at the Xilinx Alveo web page, and there are a variety of types of Alveo cards
available.  So the answer to my next question may vary by type of card.

Is it expected that the fpga program on a given card will change frequently (eg multiple
times per day), where the changed program results in a new device that would require a
different hardware description in the device tree?

Or is the fpga program expected to change on an infrequent basis (eg monthly, quarterly,
annually), in the same way as device firmware and operating systems are updated on a regular
basis for bug fixes and new functionality?
