Hi Greg

thanks for your insights.

The policy is quite simple:


     r/w  ^                             kernel space
----------|-----------------------------------------
          v (pipe)                        user space
 +-----------------+       +-----------------------+
 | trustworthy UMD |---X---| rest of the processes |
 +-----------------+       +-----------------------+

The question was more, is the LSM infrastructure complete enough that
the X can be really enforced?

Could there be other implicit information flows that the LSM
infrastructure is not able/does not yet mediate, that could break the
policy above?

I guess TSEM could be for more elaborated security models, but in this
case the policy is quite straithforward. Also, your TSEM would be as
limited as mine by the LSM hooks available.

Thanks

Roberto
