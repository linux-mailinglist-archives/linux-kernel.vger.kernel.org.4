I'm not sure what exact scenario you're thinking of when talking
about two distinct cgroups and its impact on libvirt. None the less
here's a rough summary of libvirt's approach to cgroups and memory

On the libvirt side, we create 1 single cgroup per VM, in which lives
at least the QEMU process, but possibly some additional per-VM helper
processes (swtpm for TPM, sometimes slirp/passt for NIC, etc).

Potentially there are externally managed processes that are handling
some resources on behalf of the VM. These might be a single centralized
daemon handling work for many VMs, or might be per VM services. Either
way, since they are externally managed, their setup and usage of cgroups
is completely opaque to libvirt.

Libvirt is only concerned with the 1 cgroup per VM that it creates and
manages. Its goal is to protect the host OS from a misbehaving guest
OS/compromised QEMU.

The memory limits we can set on VMs are somewhat limited. In general
we prefer to avoid setting any hard per-VM memory cap by default.
QEMU's worst case memory usage is incredibly hard to predict, because
of an incredibly broad range of possible configurations and opaque
behaviour/usage from ELF libraries it uses. Every time anyone has
tried hard memory caps, we've ended up with VMs being incorrectly
killed because they genuinely wanted more memory than anticipated
by the algorithm.

To protect the host OS, I tend to suggest mgmt apps/admins set a
hard memory limit acrosss all VMs in aggregate eg at /machine.slice,
instead of per-VM. This aims to makes it possible to ensure that
the host OS always has some memory reserved for its own system
services, while allowing the individual VMs to battle it out
between themselves.

We do still have to apply some tuning for VFIO, around what amount
of memory it is allowed to lock, but that is not so bad as we just
need to allow it to lock guest RAM which is known + an finite extra
amount, so don't need to take account of all of QEMU's memory
allocations in general. This is all still just in context of 1
cgroup though, as least as far as libvirt is aware. Any other
cgroups involved are opaque to libvirt, and not our concern as long
as QEMU's cgroup is preventing QEMU's misbehaviour as configured.

With regards,
Daniel
