Hi Mario,

Thanks for expanding the commit log.  I'm sure this patch is the right
thing to do; I just want to connect a few more dots to make it less
likely that we'll break this in the future.

All PCI devices are required to support both D3hot and D3cold (PCIe
r6.0, sec 5.3.1.4), so I think what's being advertised here is about
what firmware can do (which of course implicitly depends on controls
provided by the platform hardware), not what the *device* supports.

The OS can put a device in D3hot by itself with the PM Control
register, so I assume the important thing here is whether firmware has
interfaces to put a device in D3cold and bring it back to D0.

I know we only get to acpi_pci_bridge_d3() for PCIe devices, but when
the device properties and ACPI interfaces are not PCIe-specific, I
don't think we should restrict it by saying "PCIe".

Can you label the devices above to correspond with the preceding
paragraph?  I assume one of the XHC devices is the USB4 router, but I
don't know which is the Root Port.

Are all the devices relevant to the problem?  If not, prune the ones
that don't matter.  It looks like the domain ("0000") could also be
pruned out.

If you also include the _PR0 and/or _PS0 methods, we'll be able to see
why the current code doesn't do what we want and why the new code
will.

What determines the device links?  I assume there's some ACPI
information that connects the USB4 router with the Root Port?

What are the "D0" and "D3cold" annotations telling me?  What does
"runtime PM enabled" mean?  Is that determined based on some ACPI
methods?

It's probably obvious to PM folks what "going into runtime PM" means,
but it would help me out to describe it in terms of the hardware state
of the device, e.g., D3hot or whatever.

I guess there's a theme here of looking for concrete terms that I can
connect directly to the spec vs abstract things like "going into
runtime PM" or "root port can't handle D3" (which I think is actually
saying something about what *firmware* can do).
