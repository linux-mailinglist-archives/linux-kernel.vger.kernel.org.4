Let me apologies about my misunderstanding.

Hmm, that is a problem. Some taint flag should be useful hints
for finding the error patterns.

Sorry if I confuse you. I meant that taint flag abusing. :(

OK, so I also should remove it from FEI.

Yeah, if BPF tests already tested all ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() functions,
it may be checked already. I think we just need adding the above
explanation on the document, so that the people who will add additional
ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() on a function, can understand the limitation.

OK. Actually, I trust the BPF logic itself will be handle this
correctly. I just concerned that some people who don't know much
(because it is not carefully documented) might add ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION()
to a function which is not injectable by design. Thus I thought the
taint flag can help.
But if those are always Cc'd to bpf@vger and it will be tested by BPF
CI, I'm OK for that.

Yeah, I agree that syscall entries should be safe.

Would you mean a list of enabled BPF programs in Oops code? If so,
I also want to add enabled FEI list on it.

I think BPF logic itself is safe. But the targeted function itself
or the caller may not be designed for such error injection.
I think this is my fault that I have not documented about
ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() well. Sorry about that.

Thank you,
