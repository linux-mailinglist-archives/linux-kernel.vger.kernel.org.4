Uhh...  *What* cover letter?  A cover letter is usually the 0/NN message
in a patch series.  It is not obvious at *all* that this plain
non-numbered patch is part of a series.

CONFIG_EMBEDDED is being removed:

	<INSERT LINK HERE>

That means that everything in Kconfig that uses CONFIG_EMBEDDED needs to
switch over to something else.

Move X86_FEATURE_NAMES over to CONFIG_EXPERT instead of CONFIG_EMBEDDED.

--

This actually isn't _great_ for x86.  We hid X86_FEATURE_NAMES behind
EMBEDDED because we didn't want to see it 99% of the time.  But just
about everyone uses EXPERT=y, so the end result here is that everyone
will now see X86_FEATURE_NAMES.

Oh well.  It's just one Kconfig option.  Not a big deal.
