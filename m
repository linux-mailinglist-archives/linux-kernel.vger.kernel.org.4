Many thanks for the detailed response.  I'll leave it to the rstat folks,
to agree or disagree with your analysis there.

And this looks a very plausible argument to me: I'll let it sink in.

But I hadn't heard that the RT folks were clamouring for more irq disabling:
perhaps they partition their machines with more care, and are not devotees
of high CPU counts.

What I hope is that others will chime in one way or the other -
it does sound as if a reappraisal of the balances is overdue.

Thanks,
Hugh (disabling interrupts for as long as he can)
