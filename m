Are you certain this can be done without causing any deadlocks?

On further thought, I decided "allow_connect" is a dumb name.  Let's 
call it "unbinding" instead, since it gets set only when a gadget driver 
is about to be unbound (which is when we want to prevent new 
connections).

You need to be more careful here.  It's possible to have 
gadget->connected set at the same time as gadget->deactivated -- it 
means that when the gadget gets re-activated, it will immediately try to 
connect again.

In fact, this logic doesn't look right at all.  For example, suppose the 
gadget driver wants to disconnect.  This routine will compute connect = 
true and will see that gadget->connected is set, so it won't do 
anything!

I think it would be better just to merge the new material into 
usb_gadget_connect() and usb_gadget_disconnect().

You're missing an important point.  Before doing device_unregister(), 
this routine calls device_del(&gadget->dev).  That will unbind the 
gadget driver, which (among other things) will stop the UDC, preventing 
it from calling usb_udc_vbus_handler().  However, you're right that the 
work item will need to be cancelled at some point before the usb_udc is 
unregistered.

Moving those things to threaded IRQ handlers is a separate job.  Let's 
get this issue fixed first.
