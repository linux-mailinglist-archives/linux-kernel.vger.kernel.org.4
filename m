I'm up for trying to do that mod; do you have a feel of the best way?
I guess this is two copies to avoid symbol clashes if both the server
and clients are built/loaded on the same kernel?

I guess the clean way is to make this a separate .c/module that the
others depend on and hten you have a nice single copy in the binary
as well as the source.

The shorter hack that at least avoids the source dupe would be to
change the declarations in the uniupr.h files to a #define that then
instantiates it with different names in the place those are #included.
You'd want to move the uniupr.h up somewhere, to hmm fs/uniupr.h ?

(Incidentally, I think the UNIUPR_NOLOWER is always defined
so that whole chunk can go in both of them).

I guess the next level would be trying to merge parts of server/client
unicode.[ch] - but I was just eyeing up this particularly simple dupe in
that odd uniupr.h.

Well hmm; my reading is the tables that JFS uses are *identical*
to these; so if this header was somewhere outside of fs/smb it could
probably #include it and just use the same table, with a
no-binary-change.
