It's beginning to get exposed in PCIe 6.0 as a result of enabling cross
segment messages. Two places I know of that the segment can be seen in.
Captured TLP headers with certain AER reported errors.
Hierarchy ID Extended capability - this one takes some digging.
Specifically 7.9.17.3 Hierarchy ID Data Register which if you follow 
link to 6.25 includes Segment Group Number. 

Anyhow, not particularly relevant here and it never occurs next to
any of the BDF stuff but it is now (just about) in scope of PCIe.
