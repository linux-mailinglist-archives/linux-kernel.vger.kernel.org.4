Right, I suspected as much.

Well it was a patch series where a v3 was promised with more info about the
bug it fixes, but I haven't found a v3. So if the author or TPM maintainers
can confirm that it does (or can) indeed fix such a bug I'm observing, I'd
hope for it to be fasttracked to 6.1.

Yeah, I have compiled rc7 with patch 1/3, without the rest as that didn't
seem necessary, and there was some review feedback that some parts need
fixing. So far it didn't exhibit the bug when suspending/resuming 10 times,
but that's not yet a guarantee due to nondeterministic nature of the issue
and usually the suspends weren't happening in such rapid succession... I'll
keep using that kernel for now on the laptop, fwiw.

Great, thanks!
