The problem with a simple CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT is that the rate changes
propagate upwards in the tree for all possible sources. If the source
is the video PLL then the rate propagation is exactly what you want to
happen. If the display clock is sourced from a system PLL, you really
don't want to change the PLL rate, so we need something more clever
here.

Either the mux part of the composite clock needs to learn to only
propagate rate requests for specific sources, or we need to deny rate
changes to the system PLLs, but not sure if there are other similar
cases for other sources.
