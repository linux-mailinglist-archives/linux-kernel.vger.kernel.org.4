Yeah, right. We don't need error_fs variable and can just look at
EXT4_SB(sb)->s_mount_state.

So is the extra superblock write your only concern? Honestly, I prefer code
simplicity over saved one superblock write in case we had to replay the
journal (which should be rare anyway). If you look at the code, we can
writeout superblock several times in that mount path anyway.

If what you wanted to say: "It is not necessary to write the superblock if
EXT4_ERROR_FS is already set." I tend to agree although not 100% because
journal replay could result in rewinding 's_last_error_*' fields and so
writing superblock would still make sense even if EXT4_ERROR_FS is set in
es->s_state after journal reply. That's why I wouldn't complicate things
and just always write the superblock after journal replay.
