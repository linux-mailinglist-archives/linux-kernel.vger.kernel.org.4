Hi, I hope your day is going well.

Such as they were, the price was right... :-)

When we initiated the Quixote project, to bring security modeling and
machine learning based security policy to the kernel, the predicate
assumed was that the LSM hooks represented the complete basis set of
information that was required to define the security state of a
system.

If the current LSM hooks are insufficient in number or lack being
fully descriptive in character, the LSM by definition, cannot fully
protect a platform.

I see that Casey replied downthread and indicated he thought the LSM
hooks were sufficient to model the necessary security threats,
obviously good news for both your work and ours.

Just as a note of clarification.

Casey indicated that the LSM supported labeled networking would be of
assistance in your model, but my assumption from your diagram, is that
the dashed line with the X in it, implies that there is to be NO
information flow allowed between the sandboxed UMD process and the
rest of the processes running on the system.

This would be in contrast to the line representing some type of
limited network or pipe connectivity, with appropriate security
controls or labeling on the traffic, is this a correct assumption?

It would seem like there would need to be two classes of security
guarantees in place for your model.  First, the fact that the
trustworthy UMD cannot be forced to commit some action that was not
intended for it, and second, that the surrounding system can be
trusted to not try and exert nefarious influence on the UMD.

Wouldn't the second requirement necessitate that the UMD operate with
some form of attestation as to the character of the surrounding
system?

Other than the fact that Intel chose to not make the technology
sufficiently ubiquitous, it would seem that SGX would be tailor made
for this.

TSEM isn't about elaborate, it is about defining the notion of
workload specific security models.  A TMA running a security model,
that acts only on file digests accessed by files with uid=0, would
roughly implement IMA, with appraisal essentially for 'free'.

With respect to this discussion, one of the points that I was trying
to make is that if you make the need to parse file digests from .rpms
and .debs go away, the need for the highly protected UMD goes away as
well.

TSEM, with a signed security model processed by a trust orchestrator,
implements that model, along with an invariant representation of the
state of the system.

In fact, we have micro-controller based TMA's that pull their security
models over a CAT1.M network connection, completely external to the OS
being modeled, which is probably as much isolation as is
possible... :-)
