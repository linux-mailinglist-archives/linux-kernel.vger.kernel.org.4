Sorry missed that.

Rob would probably be relevant for this topic as well, however, I didn't 
want to focus on DT for this topic.

Seems your question is what I am actually asking...

However your answer keep getting back to do "full hardware description 
in dt and that it doesn't relate to driver" but does not give concrete 
response hence I fail to get the answer or direction I am looking for.

The solution I previously gave show different possibility for describing 
the HW and the impact on the drivers and wonder what is the best path.


For now I think this is the path I shall take which is option 1:

"1) map more specific region to avoid conflict (we don't need the same 
registers on both entity so if we do very specific multiple mapping this 
shall be resolved)"

Which seems to be what you are trying to say by give more complete HW 
description.
