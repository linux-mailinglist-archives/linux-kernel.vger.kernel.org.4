Nice catch!

No, the fact that it _can_ be modified by a writable module param is enough to
make this patch buggy.

I do like snapshotting and then updating the value, even though there's likely no
meaningful performance benefit, as that would provide a place to document that
the "supported" value is dynamic.  Though the fact that it's dynamic is arguably a bug
in its own right, e.g. if userspace isn't careful, a VM can have vCPUs with different
values for ARCH_CAPABILITIES.  But fixing that is probably a fool's errand.  So
I vote to snapshot the value and toggle the ARCH_CAP_SKIP_VMENTRY_L1DFLUSH bit
when l1tf_vmx_mitigation is modified.

On a somewhat related topic, what in the absolute #$#$ is going on with FB_CLEAR_DIS!?!?
I made the mistake of digging into why KVM doesn't advertise ARCH_CAP_FB_CLEAR_CTRL...

  1. I see *nothing* in commit 027bbb884be0 ("KVM: x86/speculation: Disable Fill
     buffer clear within guests") that justifies 1x RDMSR and 2x WRMSR on every
     entry+exit.

  2. I'm pretty sure conditioning mmio_stale_data_clear on kvm_arch_has_assigned_device()
     is a bug.  AIUI, the vulnerability applies to _any_ MMIO accesses.  Assigning
     a device is necessary to let the device DMA into the guest, but it's not
     necessary to let the guest access MMIO addresses, that's done purely via
     memslots.

  3. Irrespective of whether or not there is a performance benefit, toggling the
     MSR on every entry+exit is completely unnecessary if KVM won't do VERW before
     VM-Enter, i.e. if (!mds_user_clear && !mmio_stale_data_clear), then the
     toggling can be done in vmx_prepare_switch_to_{guest,host}().  This probably
     isn't worth pursuing though, as #4 below is more likely, especially since
     X86_BUG_MSBDS_ONLY is limited to Atom (and MIC, lol) CPUs.

  4. If the host will will _never_ do VERW, i.e. #3 + !X86_BUG_MSBDS_ONLY, then
     KVM just needs to context switch the MSR between guests since the value that's
     loaded while running in the host is irrelevant.  E.g. use a percpu cache to
     track the current value.

  5. MSR_IA32_MCU_OPT_CTRL is not modified by the host after a CPU is brought up,
     i.e. the host's desired value is effectively static post-boot, and barring
     a buggy configuration (running KVM as a guest), the boot CPU's value will be
     the same as every other CPU.

  6. Performance aside, KVM should not be speculating (ha!) on what the guest
     will and will not do, and should instead honor whatever behavior is presented
     to the guest.  If the guest CPU model indicates that VERW flushes buffers,
     then KVM damn well needs to let VERW flush buffers.

  7. Why on earth did Intel provide a knob that affects both the host and guest,
     since AFAICT the intent of the MSR is purely to suppress FB clearing for an
     unsuspecting (or misconfigured?) guest!?!?!

FWIW, this trainwreck is another reason why I'm not going to look at the proposed
"Intel IA32_SPEC_CTRL Virtualization" crud until external forces dictate that I
do so.  I have zero confidence that a paravirt interface defined by hardware
vendors to fiddle with mitigations will be sane, flexible, and extensible.

Anyways, can someone from Intel do some basic performance analysis to justify
doing RDMSR + WRMSRx2 on every transition?  Unless someone provides numbers that
show a clear, meaningful benefit to the aggressive toggling, I'm inclined to have
KVM do #4, e.g. end up with something like:

	/* L1D Flush includes CPU buffer clear to mitigate MDS */
	if (static_branch_unlikely(&vmx_l1d_should_flush)) {
		vmx_l1d_flush(vcpu);
	} else if (static_branch_unlikely(&mds_user_clear) ||
		   static_branch_unlikely(&mmio_stale_data_clear)) {
		mds_clear_cpu_buffers();
	} else if (static_branch_unlikely(&kvm_toggle_fb_clear) {
		bool enable_fb_clear = !!(vcpu->arch.arch_capabilities & ARCH_CAP_FB_CLEAR);

		if (this_cpu_read(kvm_fb_clear_enabled) != enable_fb_clear) {
			u64 mcu_opt_ctrl = host_mcu_opt_ctrl;

			if (enable_fb_clear)
				mcu_opt_ctrl &= ~FB_CLEAR_DIS;
			else
				mcu_opt_ctrl |= FB_CLEAR_DIS;
			native_wrmsrl(MSR_IA32_MCU_OPT_CTRL, mcu_opt_ctrl);
			this_cpu_write(kvm_fb_clear_enabled, enable_fb_clear);
		}
	}
