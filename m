See my reply to Oliver and Marc. To me it looks like we are converging
towards having shared memory between guest, host kernel and VMM and
that should address all our concerns.

The guest will see a MMIO device, writing to it will trigger the host
kernel to do the basic "set util_guest/uclamp for the vCPU thread that
corresponds to the vCPU" and then the VMM can do more on top as/if
needed (because it has access to the shared memory too). Does that
make sense?

Even in the extreme example, the stuff the kernel would do would still
be helpful, but not sufficient. You can aggregate the
util_guest/uclamp and do whatever from the VMM.
Technically in the extreme example, you don't need any of this. The
normal util tracking of the vCPU thread on the host side would be
sufficient.

Actually any time we have only 1 vCPU host thread per VM, we shouldn't
be using anything in this patch series and not instantiate the guest
device at all.

I think the "13% increase in battery consumption for games" makes it
pretty clear that going to userspace is prohibitive. And that's just
one example.

Part of the communication doesn't need synchronous handling by the
host. So, what I said above.

This will be worse than all the options we've tried so far because it
has the userspace overhead AND uclamp overhead.
