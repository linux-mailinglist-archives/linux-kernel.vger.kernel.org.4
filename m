My concern is that the synchronize_rcu() will block a kworker kthread
for some time, and that in callback-flood situations this might slow
things down due to exhausting the supply of kworkers.

In contrast, use of queue_rcu_work() frees up the kworker to handle
other pages that are filling up.

Perhaps your point is that the delay from synchronize_rcu() should make
the following pages take the fastpath through cond_synchronize_rcu()?

Either way, it might well be that context-switch overhead forces us
to batch these things somehow.  But let's worry about that when and if
it actually happens.
