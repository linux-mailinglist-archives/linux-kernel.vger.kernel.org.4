Yeah, I definitely don't have opinions on the right way to build a
chromebook, and replying to Boris, only slightly better at distros.
Josef's original intent was this be easy to turn off.

Developers in general tend to stretch interfaces a lot.  At some point
the friction of using the interface is worse than the friction of
changing it, and things get redone.  At the end of the day, BPF
developers are still kernel developers and we end up with relatively
sane feedback loops.

Now is a great time to grab KP and hear all about BPF LSM.

One of the awkward and wonderful parts of our community is that none of
us have the same goals or needs.  Going back to the original thread, ARM
has either one or two different live patching subsystems in use in the
industry, and neither is upstream.

One reason you end up having these arguments often with BPF is because
they stick around and work with the community to upstream their work.
The tradeoffs, compromises and decisions aren't always what you want,
but we all show up every day and keep engaging.
