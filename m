I do not find a direct statement from ACPI Spec r6.5 that allows the OS 
to write the value of the HEST AER register to the AER register of the 
corresponding device without AER control but I looked in ACPI Spec for a 
description of the relationship between writing to the AER register 
through the _HPP/_HPX method and whether the OS requires AER control：
The expression are as follows:
1. OSPM uses the information returned by _HPX to determine how ①to 
configure PCI Functions that are hot- plugged into the system, ②to 
configure Functions not configured by the platform firmware during 
initial system boot, ③and to configure Functions any time they lose 
configuration space settings (e.g. OSPM issues a Secondary Bus 
Reset/Function Level Reset or Downstream Port Containment is triggered).

2. _HPX may return multiple types or Record Settings (each setting in a 
single sub-package.) OSPM is responsible for detecting the type of 
Function and for applying the appropriate settings. OSPM is also 
responsible for detecting the device / port type of the PCI Express 
Function and applying the appropriate settings provided. For example, 
the Secondary Uncorrectable Error Severity and Secondary Uncorrectable 
Error Mask settings of Type 2 record are only applicable to PCI Express 
to PCI-X/PCI Bridge whose device / port type is 1000b. Similarly, AER 
settings are only applicable to hot plug PCI Express devices that 
support the optional AER capability.

3. Note: OSPM may override the settings provided by the _HPX object’s 
Type2 record (PCI Express Settings) or Type3 record (PCI Express 
Descriptor Settings) when OSPM has assumed native control of the 
corresponding feature. For example, if OSPM has assumed ownership of AER 
(via _OSC), OSPM may override AER related settings returned by _HPX.

This means that writing the AER register value by _HPX does not require 
the OS to gain control of the AER. Also from the usage description of 
_HPX, I think ownership of AER means who decides the configuration value 
of the AER register rather than who can write the configuration value. 
Even though the OS does not have control or ownership of the AER, it 
should still write the configuration values determined by the firmware 
to the AER register at the request of the firmware. Therefore, 
considering that HEST AER patch is an effective supplement to _HPP/_HPX 
method when the Firmware does not support the _HPP/_HPX method, I think 
the question about whether OS has control of AER to write the 
information in the HEST AER structure to the AER register of the 
corresponding device is similar to the question about _HPX/_HPP method 
to write the AER information to the AER register of the corresponding 
device. Therefore, the ownership of AER is not considered in this patch.

No direct statement to support this view is explicitly found in ACPI 
Spec v6.5. Considering that HEST AER patch is an effective supplement to 
_HPP/_HPX method when the Firmware does not support the _HPP/_HPX 
method, I think the question about whether OS has control of AER to 
write the information in the HEST AER structure to the AER register of 
the corresponding device is similar to the question about _HPX/_HPP 
method to write the AER information to the AER register of the 
corresponding device. Since writing the AER register value by _HPX does 
not require the OS to gain control of the AER, the ownership of AER is 
not considered in this patch.

The ACPI Spec has the following description: PCI Express (PCIe) root ports may implement PCIe Advanced Error Reporting (AER) support. This table(HEST) contains  information platform firmware supplies to OSPM for configuring AER support on a given root port. We understand that HEST stands for user to express expectations.
