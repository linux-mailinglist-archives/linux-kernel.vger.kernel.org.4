Okay, that makes sense to me.  Thanks.

Since the original MDWE was for systemd, I'm wondering what will happen if
some program like what you said is invoked by systemd and with MDWE enabled
already.

Currently in your patch IIUC MDWE_NO_INHERIT will fail directly on MDWE
enabled process, but then it makes me think whether it makes more sense to
allow converting MDWE->MDWE_NO_INHERIT in this case.  It seems to provide a
most broad coverage on system daemons using MDWE starting from systemd
initial process, meanwhile allows specific daemons to fork into anything
like a JIT process so it can make itself NO_INHERIT.  Attackers won't
leverage this because MDWE_NO_INHERIT also means MDWE enabled.
