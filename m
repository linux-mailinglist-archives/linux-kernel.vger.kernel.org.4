The IPU6 requires multiple drivers. The "easy" part (the IPU6 input
system) has been submitted to the linux-media mailing list (see [1]).
That driver will allow capturing raw frames from the camera sensors
(assuming drivers for the sensors in your particular device are
available).  Another driver has also be submitted to setup the IVSC (a
chip present in some systems between the camera sensor and the IPU6),
see [2].

The hard part (the IPU6 processing system) will still take time, and
once a driver for that is available, the userspace implementation in
libcamera will also take time.
