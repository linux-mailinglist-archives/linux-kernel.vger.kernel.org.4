After these discussion, I think the solution maybe use different
interfaces for "proactive demote" and "proactive reclaim".  That is,
reconsider "memory.demote".  In this way, we will always uncharge the
cgroup for "memory.reclaim".  This avoid the possible confusion there.
And, because demotion is considered aging, we don't need to disable
demotion for "memory.reclaim", just don't count it.
