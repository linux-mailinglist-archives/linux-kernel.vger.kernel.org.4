I like the idea to have all EFI archs handle compressed kernels the same
way.

But given that going EFI-only on x86 isn't a realistic option for
distros today this isn't really an alternative for Evgeny's patch
series, we have to fix the existing bzImage decompressor too.

What would be needed to do so?  Teach kexec-tools and grub2 parse and
load zboot kernels I guess?

take care,
