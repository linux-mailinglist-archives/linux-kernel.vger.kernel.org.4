I wonder if it would be worthwhile and even more generic to add some
sort of int containing file accessor construct. It could also have
support for a default value when the file doesn't exist. For example:

  "MetricExpr": "ITLB / {file://<pmu>/caps/slots(5)}"

It gets a bit fiddly because you might want to support absolute paths
and paths relative to whatever PMU is being used. But it could prevent
having to add some custom identifier and glue code for every possible
file that just has an integer in it.

It also wouldn't be possible to support the case where the file has
bitfields in it that need to be extracted, so maybe we shouldn't do it.
