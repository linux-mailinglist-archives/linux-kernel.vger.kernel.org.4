Yes. I know and agree with all of the above.

Yes. Agree. I used unfortunate example in the previous reply with nf_conn___init.
I meant to say:

 For definition:
 struct nf_conn_init {
    struct nf_conn ct;
 };
 if a kfunc accepts a pointer to nf_conn it should always accept a pointer to nf_conn_init
 for both read and write, because in C that's valid and safe type cast.

Meainng that C rules apply.
Our triple underscore is special, because it's the "same type".
In the 2nd part of my reply I'm proposing to use the whole suffix "___init" to indicate that.
I think you're arguing that just "___" part is enough to enforce strict match.
Matching foo___flavor with foo should not be allowed.
While passing struct foo_flavor {struct foo;} into a kfunc that accepts 'struct foo'
is safe.
If so, I'm fine with such approach.
