Can you tweak the shortlog to something like this?  I want to make it very clear
that this applies only to the TDP case (more below).  I did a double take when I
first read the subject :-)

No need for this, I just threw a snippet at you as part of code review.  And IMO,
if someone goes through the pain of running benchmarks, they get full credit no
matter what ;-)

Past me was wrong, which is a very good thing in this case.  Per the APM,

  The host hCR0.WP bit is ignored under nested paging.

which means that CR0.WP doesn't need to be incorporated into the role.  Ha!  And
really-past me even wrote a very nice comment to call that out in commit 31e96bc63655
("KVM: nSVM: Add a comment to document why nNPT uses vmcb01, not vCPU state").

Double ha!  That's all moot, because if this code is reached for a nested MMU,
it means L2 is active and the CR0 being changed is gCR0, not L1's hCR0.

So more simply, this can be

	if (tdp_enabled && (cr0 ^ old_cr0) == X86_CR0_WP)

or if we want to exempt non-paging mode for the shadow MMU as well...

	if ((cr0 ^ old_cr0) == X86_CR0_WP && (tdp_enabled || !(cr0 & X86_CR0_PG)))

Actually, if we bother to check CR0.PG, then we might as well get greedy and
skip _all_ updates when paging is disabled.  E.g. end up with this over two
patches?  First one exempts the tdp_enabled case, second one completely exempts
paging disabled.

	/*
	 * CR0.WP is incorporated into the MMU role, but only for non-nested,
	 * indirect shadow MMUs.  If paging is disabled, no updates are needed
	 * as there are no permission bits to emulate.  If TDP is enabled, the
	 * MMU's metadata needs to be updated, e.g. so that emulating guest
	 * translations does the right thing, but there's no need to unload the
	 * root as CR0.WP doesn't affect SPTEs when TDP is enabled.
	 */
	if ((cr0 ^ old_cr0) == X86_CR0_WP) {
		if (!(cr0 & X86_CR0_PG))
			return;

		if (tdp_enabled) {
			kvm_init_mmu(vcpu);
			return;
		}
	}
