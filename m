Yup, also a totally valid reason I forgot to mention in my reply last week.

Thx for that, knowing that Bastien is unavailable is really helpful.

Hope your enjoyed your days off!

FWIW, in case anybody is interested in a status update: one reporter
bisected the problem down to 586e8fede79 ("HID: logitech-hidpp: Retry
commands when device is busy"); reverting that commit on-top of 6.3
fixes the problem for that reporter. For that reporter things also work
on 6.4-rc; but for someone else that is affected that's not the case.

Makes me wonder if we deal with two different issues here. Just asked
where 6.4 does not work if reverting 586e8fede79 fixes things for them
as well.

For more details, see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217412

Ciao, Thorsten
