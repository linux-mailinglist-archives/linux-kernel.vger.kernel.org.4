Thanks Rob for this explanation. I would like to second that, as I've
been looking for a "solution" for exact this situation for a few years
now in multiple system configurations. The setup mostly being identical:
An FPGA connected via PCIe to the host CPU, embedded in the FPGA misc
devices like NS16550 UART, GPIO controller, etc which often have
existing drivers in the Kernel. Using this dynamic device tree node
approach for the PCIe EP with the possibility to describe the FPGA-
internal devices via device tree seems to be the most elegant solution
IMHO.

Thanks,
Stefan
