In cases such as this you'd typically coordinate with the other
developer to pick up their changes as part of your series. Especially
for this case -- David's refactoring is _pointless_ without another
user for that code (i.e. arm64). As fun as it might be to antagonize
Sean, that series pokes x86 and I'd like an ack from on it.

So, please post a combined series that applies cleanly to an early 6.4
rc of your choosing, and cc all affected reviewers/maintainers.
