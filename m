There is zero standard APIs in this patch. Does cs48l32_request_irq()
look standard to you? This whole thing makes a mockery of the
interrupt model and of firmware-based interrupt description which we
spent years to build.

Again, they have no purpose in an interrupt controller driver.

And what's left? Nothing.

An irqchip driver uses the irq_chip structure, uses irq domains to
abstract the device-specific interrupt numbering from clients, and
doesn't force the use of an esoteric API on these clients.

What I see here is the exact opposite.

Was it OK for madera? No. A moment of weakness, I presume. Do I want
to repeat the same mistake? Neither.

If you were implementing an actual interrupt controller driver, I'd
take it without any question. The fact that this code mandates the use
of its own homegrown API rules it out.

Thanks,
