It's what a lot of people would like; in the early attempts it was easy
to defeat, but in TDX and SEV-SNP the hypervisor has a lot less that it
can mess with - remember that not just the memory is encrypted, so is
the register state, and the guest gets to see changes to mapping and a
lot of control over interrupt injection etc.

> So what do you actually trust here?  The CPU?  A device?  Nothing?

We trust the actual physical CPU, provided that it can prove that it's a
real CPU with the CoCo hardware enabled.  Both the SNP and TDX hardware
can perform an attestation signed by the CPU to prove to someone
external that the guest is running on a real trusted CPU.

Note that the trust is limited:
  a) We don't trust that we can make forward progress - if something
does something bad it's OK for the guest to stop.
  b) We don't trust devices, and we don't trust them by having the guest
do normal encryption; e.g. just LUKS on the disk and normal encrypted
networking. [There's a lot of schemes people are working on about how
the guest gets the keys etc for that)

You're misreading it; This is about the grey part (i.e. the guest) not
trusting the host (the white part including qemu and the host kernel).

I don't think generally all PCI device drivers guard against all the
nasty things that a broken implementation of their hardware can do.
The USB devices are probably a bit better, because they actually worry
about people walking up with a nasty HID device;  I'm skeptical that
a kernel would survive a purposely broken USB controller.

I'm not sure the request here isn't really to make sure *all* PCI devices
are safe; just the ones we care about in a CoCo guest (e.g. the virtual devices) -
and potentially ones that people will want to pass-through (which
generally needs a lot more work to make safe).
(I've not looked at these Intel tools to see what they cover)

Having said that, how happy are you with Thunderbolt PCI devices being
plugged into your laptop or into the hotplug NVMe slot on a server?
We're now in the position we were with random USB devices years ago.

Also we would want to make sure that any config data that the hypervisor
can pass to the guest is validated.

That seems harsh.
The problem seems reasonably well understood within the CoCo world - how
far people want to push it probably varies; but it's good to make the
problem more widely understood.
