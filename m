Pff, all that is perfectly possible, just a wee bit more work :-) I
mean, we manage to poke text that's RO, surely we can poke a variable
that supposedly RO.

And I really wish we could put part of the kvm-intel/amd.ko things in
the kernel proper and reduce the EXPORT_SYMBOL surface -- we're
exporting a whole bunch of things that really shouldn't be, just for KVM
:/

Quality that :-(

Well, that's a quality of implementation issue with the whole TDX
crapola. Sounds like we want to impose latency constraints on the
various TDX calls. Allowing it to consume arbitrary amounts of CPU time
is unacceptable in any case.

FWIW, I'm 100% behind pushing complexity into userspace if it makes for
a simpler kernel.

OK.
