KF_SLEEPABLE is used to indicate whether the kfunc _itself_ may sleep,
not whether the calling program can be sleepable. call_rcu() doesn't
block, so no need to mark the kfunc as KF_SLEEPABLE. The key is that if
a kfunc is sleepable, non-sleepable programs are not able to call it
(and this is enforced in the verifier).
