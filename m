On PCI Express, there will be cases where the new code sleeps far less
than the 1s being replaced by this patch. This should be okay, because
PCI Express Base Specification Revision 5.0 Version 1.0 (May 22, 2019)
in Section 6.6.1 "Conventional Reset" only notes 100ms as the minimum
waiting time. After this time, the OS is permitted to issue
Configuration Requests, but it is possible that the device responds
with Configuration Request Retry Status (CRS) Completions, rather than
Successful Completion. Returning CRS can go on for up to 1 second after
a Conventional Reset (such as SBR) before the OS can consider the device
broken. This additional wait is handled by pci_dev_wait. Besides,
this patch also cover PCI and PCI-X after device reset waiting Tpvrh 1000ms.

Currently, the only callchain that lands in the function modified by
this patch which invokes one out of two versions of pcibios_reset_secondary_bus
that both end with a call to pci_reset_secondary_bus.

Afterwards, pci_reset_secondary_bus always invokes pci_dev_wait
which wait for the device to return a non-CRS completion.
