OK.  I'll pick up those two tags from Mika and Rafael and try to reword 
the commit message a bit.

If you completely ignore _S0W, sure you can put the device into D3hot by 
changing this register but while in the firmware configuration I 
describe you won't get wake events to pull you out of it.

So the PCIe device will stay in this state until the OS does something.

Thanks for clarifying.  I'm thinking I'll s/PCIe/ACPI/ in the commit
message to convey this.

In the above example there are 2 USB4 routers, 2 PCIe root ports used 
for tunneling and 2 XHCI PCIe devices.

They're all relevant because links are made between them.  If the XHCI
PCIe device was not in runtime PM, it could prevent the router from 
going into runtime PM as well just the same.

I could remove one triplet of devices to keep it simpler (USB4 router, 
XHCI PCIe device and PCIe root port for tunneling) but all systems I've 
seen have 2.

OK, I'll add a line/assertion which have _PS0/_PR0.

They're created when the firmware node has "usb4-host-interface".  I'll 
add some lines to describe this as well to the commit message.

D0/D3cold are tell you at rest what power states each ACPI device is in 
as read from /sys/bus/pci/devices/{bdf}/power_state

The USB4 routers are in D3cold, which shouldn't have occurred because 
the PCIe root ports for tunneling are in D0.

This only happened because runtime PM was enabled on the PCIe root port 
for tunneling, and runtime PM was enabled because acpi_pci_bridge_d3 
asserted that it supported it.

I think a simplified description here is "the device has been put into 
the deepest sleep state that it can wake itself from at runtime".

Suppliers can't go into runtime PM until all consumers of the device 
have done so.  If a consumer doesn't support runtime PM then it will 
block the supplier from entering runtime PM.

The UBS4 CM spec doesn't describe the ACPI relationships.
So I'm afraid the best I can come up with is what Microsoft says:

"For the PCIe and USB 3.x software stacks to establish power relations 
with the USB4 host router, device-specific data (_DSD) for the tunneled 
PCIe and USB 3.x ports is required. In the absence of this, the USB4 
domain may power down without coordinating with the tunneled PCIe and 
USB 3.x devices."

"Runtime PM" is the power relation that is used for Linux.

Back when we did dff6139015dc6 earlier this year the Yellow Carp systems 
didn't have power resources declared in this particularly firmware 
configuration so the behavior caused by c6e331312ebf didn't negatively 
affect anything.

If they did, I'd like to think I would have done this right the first 
time =).
