I never said it was better, I said here is a thought for discussion.
If we had to support older hardware (I could care less about things
that don't support localities, but some might not), this could be an
avenue to support them without walling off a PCR. I pointed out the
downsides, and argument could be made that when localities is not
supported then walling off PCR23 is the better approach if older
hardware is an issue. This all hinges on do we care about things
that don't support multiple localities. I don't, im for if you have locality
support you get the feature else you don't.
