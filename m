Sure, I will fix this in v2.

Most mt7621 boards don't need this extra time after initializing pci
phy related ports registers.
Devices like the two commented here (and some netgear models) seem to
need it to reliably
detect pci ports in both warm and cold resets. I don't have the
devices but the time added by
this patch has been tested on those devices. Since there is no
datasheet or something similar
that says what is this needed in the particular devices I will add the
following link to the commit
message pointing out the openwrt discussion:

Well, "proper" here was referring to having an always working solution
for these particular devices.

Pretty clear, thanks. Will add them and send v2.
