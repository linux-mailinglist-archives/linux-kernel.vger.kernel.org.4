this seems similar to what ftrace is doing in filter_match_preds,
I checked the code briefly and I wonder if we shoud be able to write
that function logic in bpf, assuming that the filter is prepared in
user space

it might solve the 'part' data problem in generic way.. but I might be
missing some blocker of course.. just an idea ;-)

could replace the tracepoint filters.. if we actually care

+1 ;-) would be awesome
