Ok, so then I am not sure how to make it work in production at the moment. I
could track the lazy callbacks in a hashtable but then that's overhead.

Or, I could focus on trying Vlad's config and figure out what's going on and
keep the auto-debug for later.

On another thought, this is the sort of thing that should be doable via Daniel
Bristot's runtime verification framework, as its a classical "see if these
traces look right" issue which should be teachable to a computer with a few rules.
