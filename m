I think this may have gone off down a rathole as my original question
wasn't anything about adding extra reserved regions. It was about
exposing what the IOVA is already reserving so it could be user
visible.

The issue was that the reservation(s) didn't appear in the
reserved_regions sysfs file, and it required adding probes or printk
debugging in order to figure out what is reserved and what is not.
Specifically what I was trying to point out is that there are regions
reserved in iova_reserve_pci_windows() that are not user/admin
visible. The function reserve_iova doesn't do anything to track the
reservation so that it can be recalled later for display. It made
things harder to debug as I wasn't sure if the addresses I was seeing
were valid for the IOMMU or not since I didn't know if they were
supposed to be reserved and the documentation I had found implied they
were.
