I am not aware of any current Intel processors having this capability yet, but a future Intel processor may have this and the above patch will have to be modified accordingly. It looks like that the RRSBA_DIS_S bit will be set once.

That is certainly OK. I am just raising a question here.

Right, I forgot kvm has a different set of code for AMD CPUs. Since this 
is Intel only, the patch looks sane to me.
