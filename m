This only affects the VMM though, and not the guest which sees the
MIDR of the CPU it runs on. The problem is that at short of pinning
the vcpus, you don't know where they will run. So any value is fair
game.

Hey, I do that all the time with kvmtool! It's just that my guest do
not care about being run on a CPU or another.

No. It will get the MIDR of the CPU it runs on. Check again. What you
describing above is solely for userspace.

Which is what happens. Not at the cluster level, but at the CPU
level. The architecture doesn't describe what a *cluster* is.

And if you do that you make it impossible for the guest to mitigate
errata, as most of the errata handling is based on the MIDR values.

I assume you meant MIDR_EL1 here, as MPIDR_EL1 is something else (and
it has no _EL0 equivalent).

> "invariant" registers) exposed via ioctl are useless and deprecated.

Useless? Not really. The all are meaningful to the guest, and a change
there will cause issues.

CTR_EL0 must, for example, be an invariant. Otherwise, you need to
trap all the CMOs when the {I,D}minLine values that are restored from
userspace are bigger than the ones the HW has. Even worse, when the
DIC/IDC bits are set from userspace while the HW has them cleared: you
cannot mitigate that one, and you'll end up with memory corruption.

I've been toying with the idea of exposing to guests the list of
MIDR/REVIDR the guest is allowed to run on, as a PV service. This
would allow that guest to enable all the mitigations it wants in one
go.

Not sure I have time for this at the moment, but that'd be something
to explore.
