I wouldn't want to tie this to the existing interface, simply because that
implies that we would want to follow the "always" and "madvise" advice too; That
means that on a thp=madvise system (which is certainly the case for android and
other client systems) we would have to disable large anon folios for VMAs that
haven't explicitly opted in. That breaks the intention that this should be an
invisible performance boost. I think it's important to set the policy for use of
THP separately to use of large anon folios.

I could be persuaded on the merrits of a new runtime enable/disable interface if
there is concensus.
