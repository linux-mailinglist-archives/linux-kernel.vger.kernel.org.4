We conducted some experiments on our end and tried using different
clocks as inputs for PWM to generate small rates like 16kHz. The clock
with the least amount of jitter for the resulting output was the RTC
parent at 32kHz, while using the 64MHz (system clock) or the 24MHz (xtal
clock) resulted in more jitter values but was still acceptable.

As for power consumption, I'm not knowledgeable about it; it's something
only Amlolgic has all the secrets to. However, I presume there was a
strong reason to create a separate RTC clock with good 32kHz quality.
