I understand all that. What I'm asking is, what happens in KVM *after*
your patch 1/3 is applied when a guest tries to set EFER.LMSLE? Does it
#GP or does it allow the WRMSR to succeed? I.e., does KVM check when
reserved bits in that MSR are being set?

By looking at it, there's kvm_enable_efer_bits() so it looks like KVM
does control which bits are allowed to set and which not...?

See, this is what I don't get - why is it defective? After the revert,
that bit to KVM is reserved.

I don't mind all that and the X86_FEATURE bit and so on - I'm just
trying to ask you guys: what is KVM's behavior when the guest tries to
set a reserved EFER bit.

Maybe I'm not expressing myself precisely enough...
