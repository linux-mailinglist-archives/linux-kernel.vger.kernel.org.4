In the framework of the current DW PCIe driver functionality it's
safe. Moreover all the DW PCIe Port-Logic CSRs are of the DWORD
size anyway.

Consider the returned FFs as a unsupported request returned for TLPs
sent to invalid or unreachable PCIe device. Though in this particular
case there is no actual TLP emitted, but just an MMIO operation
performed. Why is that needed? Mainly to somehow indicate a
malfunction access. It's also needed to detect the DW PCIe core
inconsistencies like requesting the IOs of the unsupported sizes or
from the size-unaligned addresses. See the way the dw_pcie_write() and
dw_pcie_read() are implemented in the DW PCIe core driver. The only
difference is that the later methods return garbage in case of the
errors and I don't use the PCIBIOS_SUCCESSFUL and
PCIBIOS_BAD_REGISTER_NUMBER macros in my driver by the @Rob earlier
request.

Which device driver? This driver is a vendor-specific DW PCIe
controller driver. It calls a function to register the PCIe host
device based on the DW PCIe platform device, which in its turn
registers the DMA-engine device based on the same platform device. The
platform device turns to be parental for both of them. It's used to
properly map the memory ranges for both of these devices. Anyway if
you say that some other device driver is supposed to initialize the
mask why on earth the pcie-designware-host.c driver sets the DMA mask
to the platform device then?

Note DMA-mask indicates the device DMA capability. It isn't something what
a generic driver can always detect especially in case of a platform
device. So the corresponding LLDD is the best place for it to be set
or overwritten anyway.

Again what William suggested was not that much useful. The only thing
which can and should be done based on his message is dropping the
dma_set_mask() method call from dw_pcie_msi_host_init() since the mask
is set to 32-bits by default anyway. Moreover as I said to William in
my response earlier having the DMA mask explicitly set to 32-bits for
all DW PCIe devices may cause the DMA performance degradation since in
that case the DMA above 4GB will be either bounce buffered to the
lower addresses or will fail on the memory mapping stage. But that is
a subject of another fixup-patch. Meanwhile this patch sets the
DMA-mask in accordance with the platform device capability no matter
what part of it performs DMA (Note it can be not only embedded eDMA,
but inbound iATU too).
