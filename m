Does spliting the page_pool.h as above fix the problem about including
a ton of static inline functions from "linux/dma-mapping.h" in skbuff.c?

As the $path/page_pool/helpers.h which uses dma_get_cache_alignment()
must include the "linux/dma-mapping.h" which has dma_get_cache_alignment()
defining as a static inline function.
and if skbuff.c include $path/page_pool.h or $path/page_pool/helpers.h,
doesn't we still have the same problem? Or do I misunderstand something
here?
