No?  But I highly doubt the average user is even aware of KVM_SET_PMU_EVENT_FILTER,
let alone knows how to use it.  E.g. AFAICT QEMU doesn't support the ioctl().
And for people that do use event filters, I doubt they're running on hybrid CPUs.

KVM has to be paranoid and assume those CPUs could be onlined in the future.

That seems unlikely.  My interpretation of the comment, specifically the "Quirk" and
"some ... machine" parts, is that the intended behavior is to clear the HYBRID bit,
but _some_ platforms fail to do so.

I don't think Intel's intent matters though.  If the kernel benefits from clearing
HYBRID and there are no downsides, then it should be cleared regardless of what
Intel intended ucode to do.
