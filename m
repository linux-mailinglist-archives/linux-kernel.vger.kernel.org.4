I get your point, but that is essentially saying that there should be no
linkages between our documentation subtrees, which defeats much of the
purpose of using a system like Sphinx.

In this specific case, though, there is a better solution.  Text like:

  see the netdev FAQ (Documentation/process/maintainer-netdev.rst)

will add links in the built docs, and also tells readers of the
plain-text files where they should be looking.  Without adding warnings.

For the bigger problem, the right answer is to start using intersphinx.
I guess I need to get serious about playing with that.

Thanks,

jon
