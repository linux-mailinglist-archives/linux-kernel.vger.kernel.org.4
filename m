This is all fine. I'm asking you to distinguish between
trusted-not-refcounted and trusted-and-refcounted.
It is necessary for nf_conn, since the object can be reused if the
refcount is not held.
Some other CPU could be reusing the same memory and allocating a new
nf_conn on it while we change its status.
So it's not ok to call bpf_ct_change_timeout/status on trusted
nf_conn, but only on trusted+refcounted nf_conn.

Trusted doesn't capture the difference between 'valid' vs 'valid and
owned by prog' anymore with the new definition
for PTR_TO_BTF_ID.

Yes, in most cases the tracepoints/tracing functions whitelisted will
have the caller ensure that,
but we should then allow trusted nf_conn in those hooks explicitly,
not implicitly by default everywhere.
Until then it should be restricted to ref_obj_id > 0 IMO as it is right now.

What I meant is that in the normal case, usually objects aren't reused
while the RCU read lock is held.
In case of nf_conn, the refcount needs to be held to ensure that,
since it uses SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU.
This is why bpf_ct_lookup needs to bump the refcount and match the key
after that again, and cannot just return the looked up ct directly.

I understand (and agree) that you don't want to complicate things further.
It's fine if you want to deal with this later when the above concern
materializes. But it will be yet another thing to keep in mind for the
future.
