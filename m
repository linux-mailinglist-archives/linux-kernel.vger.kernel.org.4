Ok! So at least this test means that the issue does not affect all
devices. That is good to know.

This is interesting. Maybe Windows can recover from that error?

Anyway, you can use also lspci and setpci on Windows, last version of
pciutils has better support for it.

Could you try to enable ACS on Windows? If igc continue to work or also
crash on Windows?
