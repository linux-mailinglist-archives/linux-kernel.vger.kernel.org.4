That's true. But it's true for all occurrences of hex2bin() in this file.
I could pr_err() an explanation, improve the trusted-encrypted.rst example 
and respin the patch. Should I, or do you have another suggestion?

I wasn't aware of keyctl09.c, but quickly looking into it, the user data 
_is_ hex-ascii-encoded, only the length is "wrong": Imho, the specified 
length should be the binary length as this is consistent with key-length 
specs in other cases (e.g. when loading the key from a blob).
keyctl09.c could be easy to fix, if only the length is modified. Should 
I propose a patch? What is the correct/appropriate workflow there?

Thanks,
Niko
