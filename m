Here is one way to script this, where "SHA" identifies the commit to
be checked and PATHS the affected pathnames:

	git checkout SHA^
	git show SHA | git apply -
	git blame -M PATHS | grep '^0* '

If there is no output, there were no non-move changes.  

Or just do the "git blame -M PATHS | grep '^0* '" before doing the
checking.

And yes, you can derive PATHS using "git status" if you want.  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
