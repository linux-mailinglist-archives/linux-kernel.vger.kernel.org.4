The reason why I think the lvalue of a "=" operator can be argued to be 
"special" is because it is simply invalid to apply many of the C 
operators to an lvalue (e.g. +, -, /, ...), which leads me to think that 
there are no valid lvalue parameters which can cause unexpected operator 
precedence.

That being said, just having to *think* about it is wasted brain power, 
so I am in favor of just adding the parentheses for lvalues as well.

Yes, so no exception for the lvalue of an assignment, therefore giving:

#define m(x) do { (x) = 2; } while (0)

If we are OK with this, I will go ahead and update my patch set accordingly.

Thanks,

Mathieu
