Do you know how pciehp_unconfigure_device() will be called when the device is
removed? Is it due to a DLLSC event or a PDC state change? If it is DLLSC,
pciehp_unconfigure_device() may not be called because we ignore the DLLSC event
if there is an active DPC trigger.

Ok. I will add it.

Agree.

If we clear the DPC trigger status in the DLLSC state change handler, I
agree there could be a race. However, if we clear the DPC trigger in the
PDC state change handler, I believe it will not race because the device
has already been removed. Is my understanding correct?
