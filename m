All of these links seem to discuss the draft chapters somehow being
incompatible with the non-draft ones. I would very expect that that,
as pointed out in several places there, that the draft chapters
finalisation would not lead to meaningful (and incompatible!) changes
being made to the non-draft chapters.

Maybe yourself and Palmer are looking at this from different
perspectives? Looking at his patch from Friday:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20230203001201.14770-1-palmer@rivosinc.=
com/
He specifically mentioned this aspect, as opposed to the aspect that
your links refer to.

Surely a duo-plic, if that ever comes to be, could be detected from
compatible strings in DT or w/e - but how do you intend differentiating
between an implementation of S*aia that contains the IOMMU support in
Chapter 9 in a finalised form, versus an implementation that may make
"different decisions" when it comes to that chapter of the spec?
I thought that would be handled by extension versions, but I am told
that those are not a thing any more.
If that's not true, and there'll be a version number that we can pull in
=66rom a DT and parse which will distinguish between the two, then please
correct my misunderstanding here!

Thanks,
Conor.
