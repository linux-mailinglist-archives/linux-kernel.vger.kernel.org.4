Hi Thomas,

If you give us a new API to create timers with specified id-s, we will
figure out how to live with it. It isn't good to ask users to update
CRIU to work on new kernels, but here are reasons and event improvements
for CRIU, so I think it's worth it.

As for API, we can use one bit of sigevent.sigev_notify to request a
timer with a specified id.

Thanks,
Andrei
