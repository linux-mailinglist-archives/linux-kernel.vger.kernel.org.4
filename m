See bf7fbeeae6db ("module: Cure the MODULE_LICENSE "GPL" vs. "GPL v2"
bogosity") for more information on the contents of MODULE_LICENSE.

I don't really have a comment on the rest of this, other than thinking
that, for the microchip one, you should leave it as is & the driver be
changed to be module capable.
