Yes. Great catch!

I feel shame that I missed this counter piece when I realized that
the write barrier was missing.

This barrier has basically the same purpose as the implicit read
barrier in klp_update_patch_state().

The comment in klp_update_patch_state() says that the read barrier
actually has two purposes. The 1st one is easy. It is the one
described above.

It took me quite some time to understand the 2nd purpose again.
The original comment was:

	 * 2) Enforce the order of the TIF_PATCH_PENDING read and a future read
	 *    of func->transition, if klp_ftrace_handler() is called later on
	 *    the same CPU.  See __klp_disable_patch().

I think that a better description would be:

	 * 2) Make sure that this CPU sees func->transition enabled when
	 *    it sees the TIF_PATCH_PENDING enabled. This is important when
	 *    the current task is transitioning itself and then calls
	 *    klp_ftrace_handler() later. It ensures that the ftrace handler
	 *    would check the state change that we did here.
	 *    The corresponding write barrier is in __klp_enable_patch()
	 *    and __klp_disable_patch().

Note that the previous comment wasn't correct. IMHO, the related write
barrier is needed in both __klp_enable_patch() and __klp_disable_patch().

Is the extra empty line intended?

This made me to revisit all the barriers in the livepatch code.
The good thing is that it seems that all the barriers are correct,
including the new ones proposed in this patchset.

But some comments are a bit misleading. I would like to update
them a bit. I have started working on it but it goes slowly.
I often get lost...

I am not sure about the ordering. I do not want to block this patchset
by the clean up of the comments. The currently proposed ones are
good enough. Feel free to send v3.

Or would you prefer to wait for my clean up of the comments?

Best Regards,
Petr
