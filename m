Good question.

I left the disabled blocks in the code as a bookmark for an outstanding
question: should klp-convert avoid converting relocations in any
read-only-ish section?

This becomes interesting in the late module loading case -- some arches
(ppc64le IIRC) do not like the module loader tweaking these relocations
post module load. [1]

In "[PATCH v7 09/10] livepatch/selftests: add data relocations test"
test_klp_convert_data.c, you'll see a few "// .rela.data.rel.ro,
.rela.rodata supported ??" comments.  Those would generate relocations
in such sections.

Do they *need* to be supported?  AFAIK kpatch-build hasn't needed to
create any of those.  That said, it's not too difficult for this
patchset's self-tests to generate these.  klp-convert could easily
detect this scenario.  The livepatch author could be advised to remove
const or  __ro_after_init annotation to move the relocation out of the
read-only-ish section.

I was tinkering with an alternate sympos annotation (I'll describe it in
a separate reply) and think that these debug routines could be activated
with --debug cmdline flag(s).  They can be handy for debug/development,
so better to make them always active rather than #if 0'd out.
