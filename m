... and it will be fine to use bpf_ct_change_timeout from tp_btf as well.

From kfunc's pov trusted pointer means valid pointer.
It doesn't need to be ref_obj_id refcounted from the verifier pov.
It can be refcounted on the kernel side and it will be trusted.
The code that calls trace_*() passes only trusted pointers into tp-s.
If there is a tracepoint somewhere in the kernel that uses a volatile
pointer to potentially uaf kernel object it's a bug that should be fixed.

and it will be. Just not by the verifier.

Disagree as explained above.

This is not related to RCU. Let's not mix RCU concerns in here.
It's a different topic.

I'm still against that.

Args of fentry and fexit will not have PTR_TO_BTF_ID | PTR_TRUSTED.
So not an issue.
We can allowlist certain hooks. Like all of bpf-lsm hooks and many others.
But not all of them.
