Yes, I guess so. Actually this comes from an unexplored IRC comment from
Andy back in July:

2022-07-29 21:21:56 <amluto> zx2c4: WRITE_ONCE(_vdso_rng_data.generation, next_gen + 1);
2022-07-29 21:22:23 <amluto> For x86 it shouldnâ€™t matter much. For portability, smp_store_release

Though maybe that doesn't actually matter much? When the userspace CPU
learns about a change to vdso_rng_data, it's only course of action is
make a syscall to getrandom(), anyway, and those paths should be
consistent with themselves, thanks to the same locking and
synchronization there's always been there. So maybe I actually should
move back to WRITE_ONCE() here? Hm?

Right, thanks. Will do.

Good idea.

Right, for this simple fork() case, it works fine. There are other cases
though that are trickier...

Actually, this isn't something that matters, I don't think. If
state->key_batch is zeroed, the result will be wrong, but the function
logic will be fine. If state->pos is zeroed, it'll write to the
beginning of the batch, which might be wrong, but the function logic
will still be fine. That is, in both of these cases, even if the
calculation is wrong, there's no memory corruption or anything. So then,
the remaining member is state->generation. If this is zeroed, then it's
actually something we detect with that READ_ONCE()! And in this case,
it's a sign that something is off -- we forked -- and so we should start
over from the beginning. So I don't think there's a reason to mark the
whole struct as volatile. The one we care about is state->generation,
and for that we READ_ONCE() it at the place that matters.

There's actually a different scenario, though, that I'm concerned about,
and this is the case in which a multithreaded program forks in the
middle of one of its threads running this. Indeed, only the calling
thread will carry forward into the child process, but all the memory is
still left around from any concurrent threads in the middle of
vgetrandom(). And if they're in the middle of a vgetrandom() call, that
means they haven't yet done erasure and cleaned up the stack to prevent
their state from leaking, and so forward secrecy is potentially lost,
since the child process now has some state from the parent.

I'm not quite sure what the best approach here is. One idea would be to
just note that libcs should wait until vgetrandom() has returned
everywhere before forking, using its atfork functionality. Another
approach would be to say that multithreaded programs using this
shouldn't fork or something, but that seems disappointing. Or more state
could be allocated in the zeroing region, to hold a chacha state, so
another 64 bytes, which would be sort of unfortunate. Or something else?
I'd be interested to hear your impression of this quandary.

Jason
