No disagreement here, my concern was about introducing a workaround for
the lack of proper memory accounting. I'd like to avoid the workaround,
but it doesn't mean memory accounting has to be implement now.

I've thought about that too. It's an annoying problem, it should
probably be discussed with memory management developers.
