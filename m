Yes, I do not really like the WARN_ON here. It is an overkill. pr_warn
would much less intrusive but potentially incomplete because you won't
know who that offender is. So if you really care about those then you
would need to call dump_stack as well.

So the real question is. Do we really care so deeply? After all somebody
might be calling this from within a spin lock or irq disabled section
resulting in a similar situation without noticing.
