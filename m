Right, the pci-sysfs reset attribute is only meant for a reset scope
limited to the device, we'd need something to call pci_reset_bus() to
commit to the whole hierarchy, which is not something we typically do.
vfio-pci will only bind to endpoint devices, so it shouldn't provide an
interface to inject a bus reset here either.

Based on the fact that there's a pericom switch in play here, I'll just
note that I think this is the same device with other link speed issues
as well:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20161026180140.23495.27388.stgit@gimli.home/

This fell off my plate some time ago, but as noted there, enabling ACS
when the upstream and downstream ports run at different link rates
exposes errata where packets are queued and not delivered within the
switch.

Could enabling ACS on this device be contributing to the issue here,
for example triggering the Asmedia downstream port to get into this
link reseting issue?  A test with
pci=disable_acs_redir=0000:06:01.0;0000:06:02.0 could be interesting
assuming this occurs on an platform that has an IOMMU, ie. calls
pci_request_acs().  Thanks,

Alex
