Some of the discussion here got lost because of email issues.  Lore
has some:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/1663075485-20591-1-git-send-email-lixiaochun.2888@163.com/T/#u,
and patchwork has a v2 with a little more discussion:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/patch/1664288166-7432-1-git-send-email-lixiaochun.2888@163.com/

But the v2 patch doesn't seem to have made it to the mailing lists or
to lore (https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=f%3Alixc17) and I don't apply
things until they appear on the mailing list.

I *would* like to get rid of those "no space" and "failed to assign"
messages.  This is an issue for platforms other than VMD, too.  Just
an FYI that you need to follow up on this if we want make progress.
