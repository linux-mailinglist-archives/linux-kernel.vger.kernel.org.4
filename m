+ eBPF guys (as I'm talking about eBPF)

File digests are distributed in a multitude of formats: RPM packages
provide them in RPMTAG_FILEDIGESTS, DEB packages in md5sum (now
sha256sum), containers I guess they have a manifest.

File digests would be used as reference values for IMA Appraisal and
IMA Measurement (to have a predictable PCR).

If we manage to write a tiny parser for RPM headers (I'm talking about
something like 200 lines) to extract the file digests, basically we
have all the information we need to do IMA Appraisal on current, past
and future RPM-based Linux distributions.

If we do the same for DEB (ok, well, when they switch from MD5 to
SHA256), we can support all DEB-based Linux distributions too.

On the opposite side, yes, we can change the RPM format, ask the
distributions to sign per-file. If it was that easy, we would not be
(still) waiting for the first distribution (Fedora 38) to support file
signatures since 2016, when the feature was proposed (sorry if it looks
like diminishing what Mimi and IBM proposed, I'm trying to convey the
idea of how difficult is to realize that architecture).

What about other formats? How long it could take for them to be adapted
to store file signatures?

Immediate support for IMA Appraisal is as far as looping into the RPM
header sections to obtain the data offset of RPMTAG_FILEDIGESTS and
converting the digests at that offset from hex to bin (we need also to
verify the PGP signature of the RPM header, but I would leave it for
later).

You probably also see how close we are to accomplish the goal. I'm open
to suggestions: if this idea of an isolated process doing the parsing
is not suitable, I could implement it in a different way.

So far I proposed:

- In-kernel parser (dangerous, not scalable)
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210914163401.864635-1-roberto.sassu@huawei.com/
- eBPF (no program signatures, not compliant with the LSM conventions,
  unsolved security issues)
https://github.com/robertosassu/diglim-ebpf/commit/693745cb388bca7354233cadae1fe2d23d47ff9d
- Isolated user space process (not enough isolation guarantees)
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel//20230317145240.363908-1-roberto.sassu@huaweicloud.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel//20230425173557.724688-1-roberto.sassu@huaweicloud.com/

Thanks
