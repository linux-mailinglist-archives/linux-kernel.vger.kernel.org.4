As I just wrote in a reply to Jakub: Not sure. Every special case makes
things harder for humans and software that looks at a commits downstream.

For the record, let me repeat and further elaborate what I already said
on social media before you wrote your mail:

 * I'm not mostly neutral here, but it was Linus who wrote "please stop
making up random tags that make no sense." in [1]. This was triggered by
a use of "BugLink:"; maybe there are tools out there that rely on that
tag, hence their users might ask for a exception as well. That's why I
think it's Linus call to grant any exceptions.

[1]
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAHk-=wgs38ZrfPvy=nOwVkVzjpM3VFU1zobP37Fwd_h9iAD5JQ@mail.gmail.com/

 * if such an exception is made, it IMHO must be documented in our
documentation, so any software and humans that rely on these tags are
aware of it.

Ciao, Thorsten
