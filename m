You are right we have define a new config flag in Kconfig, and selected CONFIG_OF
and CONFIG_OF_EARLY_FLATTREE. We are working on upstreaming that patch as well
however that will be a separate patch series.

I will be changing the parent node to soc node as suggested by Krzysztof
in other thread.

soc {
        #address-cells = <2>;
        #size-cells = <2>;

	vmbus@ff0000000 {
            #address-cells = <2>;
            #size-cells = <1>;
            compatible = "Microsoft,vmbus";
            ranges = <0x00 0x00 0x0f 0xf0000000 0x10000000>;
        };
};

This will be sufficient.

Saurabh
