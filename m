Thanks for the review, Stanislav. I agree that it would be nice to have
some automation to prevent forgetting the tag. I thought about ways to
possibly do it, including playing around with putting the kfuncs into a
separate section for post-processing which we could check against
.BTF_ids, but it felt like a lot of complexity / possibly controversial
changes that I'm hesitant to bring into the patch set which should be
pretty non-controversial otherwise.

With respect to validating the presence of kfunc "tags" (i.e. the
__diag_push() / __diag_pop() we were doing before), we're in the same
state after this patch as we were before, so my preference is to defer
improving that until a later time when we've fried some of the bigger
kfunc fish. Does that sound ok?

Thanks! FYI, I'm planning on sending a v2 with Alexei's suggestion [0]

[0]: https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAADnVQLpK7WXTjF6GS1hcfPXf=8iERJmEeVFfvmG75mJj0DdaA@mail.gmail.com/

I'll go ahead and preemptively leave off your Acked-by for that, as the
patches will have changed enough that it probably warrants another
read through.
