I meant the actual single PID of the process. That will be the safest
way by default.

Would you mean using the same events between several different processes?
I think it needs more care about security concerns. More on this later.

If not, I think admin has a way to identify which processes are running in
the same group outside of ftrace, and can set the filter correctly.

My thought is the latter. Then the process can not access to the
other process's namespace each other.

Indeed. But fundamentally allowing user to create (register) the new 
event means such DoS attack can happen. That's why we have a limitation
of the max number of user_events. (BTW, I want to make this number
controllable from sysctl or tracefs. Also, we need something against the
event-id space contamination by this DoS attack.) 
I also think it would be better to have some rate-limit about registering
new events.

Yeah, if it is always used with k8s in the backend servers, it maybe OK.
But if it is used in more unreliable environment, we need to consider
about malicious normal users.

OK, so I think we are on the same page :)

I think the user namespace is not enough for protecting events on
multi-user system without containers. So it has less flexibility.
The new tracer namespace may be OK, we still need a helper user
program like 'user_eventd' for managing access based on some policy.
If we have a way to manage it with SELinux etc. it will be the best
I think. (Perhaps using UNIX domain socket will give us such flexibility.)
