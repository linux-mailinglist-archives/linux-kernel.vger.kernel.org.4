I don't understand how this is answers about redundant piece of subject.
Amount of files are not related to repeating pieces of subject prefix.

21 patches, so what exactly I should see (except that I was involved in
that discussions)?

Plus nothing from this thread warrants here exception from naming style.

Then clearly state this.

Nothing like this was said in commit msg, so how can we know?

Anyway, none of this explains exception from naming convention - vendor,
device or family name.

Then clock provider, but are you sure? You included there syscon and
reset controller.

But what is a system controller node? Some separate device? This is
description for this device - called "Clock" or "Clocks" - and "system
controller" appears for the first time.

I don't understand why. It is used in DTS, so what this node represents
there?

We talk here about hardware, not drivers, so moving driver code around
does not help me understand the rationale behind bindings.

Sure, but it is not related to bindings.

No, it is not. m is before r in alphabet.
