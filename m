That's the first time I hear about "reverse fir tree" variable order,
no wonder other people were surprised too.

AFAIK the most common variable order seems to be the order in which these
variables actually get first used inside that code block.

This says do "copy-paste the relevant snippet"...

More specific guidance would probably help here.

Do we strictly obey the "75 characters max" rule for the subject/shortlog
or do we prefer to be more flexible here if it results in a more
descriptive patch subject?

I would add an exception here from mandatory testing for changes that
obviously have negligible probability of affecting runtime behavior.

For example: patches that modify just code comments or documentation.

(...)

Thanks for preparing such a detailed handbook Sean.

However, having so many rules might seem intimidating for newcomers, and
deter them from contributing out of fear that they'll be screamed at for
accidentally breaking some obscure rule.

That's especially true for unpaid volunteers that might become
professional kernel developers one day if their learning curve isn't
made too steep.

Maybe have a paragraph or two that, despite all these rules, KVM x86
strives to be a welcome community, encouraging newcomers and understanding
their beginner mistakes (or so)?

Thanks,
Maciej
