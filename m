I assume the active high behavior is hardware behavior that is
independent of the fact that you're using ACPI firmware on the
hardware.  If so, I would omit "ACPI based".

I don't think you need this spec reference, since "asserted low" is
the standard thing that happens everywhere.  But if you do want it, it
needs to specify which spec it refers to, e.g., "Conventional PCI
r3.0, sec 2.2.6" so it's not confused with the PCIe spec.

The quote from the spec itself should be terminated with a close quote
("), i.e., 

  "Interrupts on PCI ... asserted low"

This is the part where I was hoping for a reference to a spec that
talks about how PCI interrupts are inverted.  The inverter is the part
that's special here.

I see that ACPI r6.5, sec 5.2.12, mentions LPIC, but it doesn't
mention the inverter.  It has a lot more mentions of GIC, but also no
details about an inverter.  I suppose that would be in the GIC spec,
which I'm not familiar with.

The point is that one should be able to write this code from a spec,
without having to empirically discover the interrupt polarity.  What
spec tells you about using ACTIVE_HIGH here?

s/PCI-to-to PCI/PCI-to-PCI/ again

Rewrap the log to fill 75 columns like the rest of the history.

Is "LoongArch" required in this comment?  Might the LPIC model be used
on non-LoongArch systems?

I see it follows the example of "ARM systems".  In my opinion, "ARM"
probably should be removed, too, because the code checks only for GIC
or LPIC; it doesn't check for ARM or LoongArch.

If GIC is restricted to ARM and LPIC is restricted to LoongArch,
that's fine, but that constraint should be expressed somewhere else
and doesn't need to be repeated here.
