The reverse problem occurs when a PMC is configured to count "CPUID
instructions retired." Since KVM intercepts CPUID and emulates it, the
PMC will always read 0, even if the guest executes a tight loop of
CPUID instructions.

The PMU is not virtualizable on AMD CPUs without significant
hypervisor corrections. I have to wonder if it's really worth the
effort.
