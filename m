> Your patches seem ok to me now (thanks for you contribution and, above all, for your patience). I have only a high-level concern: what do you mean when you say that service guarantees are still preserved? What test did you run exactly? This point is very important to me. I'd like to see some convincing test with differentiated weights. In case you don't have other tools for executing such tests quickly, you may want to use the bandwidth-latency test in my simple S benchmark suite (for which I'm willing to help).

Is there any test that you wish me to try?

By the way, I think for the case that multiple groups are activaced, (
specifically num_groups_with_pendind_rqs > 1), io path in bfq is the
same with or without this patchset.

Thanks,
Kuai
