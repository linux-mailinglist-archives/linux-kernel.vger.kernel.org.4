Maybe something like "Delay 100ms T_PVPERL from power stable to PERST#
inactive" to match the language in the spec?

I wouldn't bother mentioning "some custom platform implemented using
TI's K3 SOCs" then, because the problem is that the driver didn't
observe T_PVPERL, so the problem will happen with some endpoints but
not others.

I think it should be in drivers/pci/pci.h so all the controller
drivers can use the same thing.  Obviously none of them *currently*
use it, although there are a bunch of "msleep(100)" and a few comments
that mention T_PVPERL.
