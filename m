Then maybe we need to do the device_link_add somewhere else.

The mainline kernel delays probing of camera sensors on Intel platforms
until the INT3472 driver has probed the INT3472 device on which the
sensors have an ACPI _DEP.

This is already used to make sure that clock lookups and regulator
info is in place before the sensor's probe() function runs.

So that when the driver does clk_get() it succeeds and so that regulator_get()
does not end up returning a dummy regulator.

So I think the code adding the device_link-s for the IVSC should be added
to: drivers/platform/x86/intel/int3472/discrete.c and then the runtime-resume
will happen before the sensor's probe() function runs.

Likewise drivers/platform/x86/intel/int3472/discrete.c should also ensure
that the ivsc driver's probe() has run before it calls 
acpi_dev_clear_dependencies().

The acpi_dev_clear_dependencies() call in discrete.c tells the ACPI subsystem
to go ahead and create the i2c-clients for the sensors and allow the sensor
drivers to get loaded and probe the sensor.

Regards,

Hans
