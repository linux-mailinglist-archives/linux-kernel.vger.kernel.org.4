Taken me a while to get around to it, but thanks for your suggestion.
Looks like it is suitable for what I am trying to do, so in the middle
of working on another version of this using fw_upload.
The enum return codes from write are a little clumsy, but oh well, could
be worse I suppose.

Just one thing I noted (although I rarely pay much attention to/rely on
the driver-api docs when recent drivers exist as usable examples) is
that the docs for this stuff is a wee bit out of date due to some API
changes.
In the code example in this document:
https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/firmware/fw_upload.html
firmware_upload_register() has fewer arguments than it does when you
look at the signature of the function in the documentation right below
it.

Cheers,
Conor.
