As was mentioned in the original cover letter on v1, these patches were 
actually the bottom half of a branch adding DT support - the DT parts 
are still untested and not quite complete (there's a property I don't 
need for the thing I'm looking at, but still deserves to be hooked up in 
general), but it seemed worth landing these prep patches since they 
impact what Besar and Ilkka are also working on in parallel.

At this point, the kconfig could indeed be "depends on (ARM64 && 
ACPI_APMT) || COMPILE_TEST". I can't recall why I didn't change that 
when splitting these patches out for posting - I may have decided the 
impact was negligible (i.e. even with DT support, it's still going to be 
a driver most people won't care about anyway), or the visibility vs. 
functional dependency aspect may have just slipped my mind entirely. 
You're welcome to make that change for now if you'd like to.

(I'm not sure how soon I'll be posting the follow-up DT patches, since 
I'm dependent on other people to provide testing and feedback, and 
haven't heard any news yet)

Thanks,
Robin.
