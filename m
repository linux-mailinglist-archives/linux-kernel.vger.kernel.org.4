I don't think there's a deliberate "intention" beyond "does it work?".  Like many
of the historical bits of KVM x86, I think this is a case of the original authors
_wanting_ to provide certain behavior, but not actually ensuring that behavior in
code.

That very much depends on the use case.  For personal usage of KVM, it's extremely
unlikely that userspace is doing anything remotely sophisticated.  But for a more
"formal" deployment, userspace absolutely has its hands all over the system, e.g.
scheduling VMs across systems, monitoring the health of the system, etc.  Whether
or not userspaces actually do tightly control loading KVM is another matter...

Me too. :-)

Eh, the compatibility checks we really care about run in IRQ context, i.e. they're
guaranteed to have a stable CPU.  Splitting the _setup_ for the compatibility
checks across multiple CPUs isn't a problem because KVM will still get the right
"answer", i.e. any divergence will be detected (barring _very_ flaky hardware that
might get false negatives anyways).

Don't get me wrong, I agree it's ugly, but I don't want to go halfway.  I either
want to guard the whole thing, or nothing, and I can't convince myself that
guarding everything is worthwhile since userspace can (and IMO should) do a better
job.
