dom0 only has access to paravirtualized EFI runtime services, so
consuming RT_PROP or MEMATTR should be up to Xen (they describe which
runtime services remain available at runtime, and which permission
attributes to use for the runtime services memory regions,
respectively)

Looking through the kernel code, I don't think there are any that dom0
should care about beyond ACPI, SMBIOS and ESRT. But as you suggest,
that means Xen should just mask them in the view of the EFI system
table it exposes so dom0. Otherwise, the kernel may still try to map
and parse them.
