True, I concur!

Yeah it could improve things (or make them worse ;-). In that approach, I
guess those other waiters will not be spinning for too long once the first
waiter gets the lock, as mutex_spin_on_owner() it will break out of the spin:

while (__mutex_owner(lock) == owner) {
  ...
}

But yeah it sounds like a plausible idea.

Ah ok. I see what you're doing now!

I guess that check will help whenever the top-waiter keeps changing. In that
case you want only the latest top-waiter as the spinner, all while the lock
owner is not changing.

Ah yeah, true!

True! So in the FIFO thing, there's no way a high prio task can get ahead in
line of the first waiter, makes sense.

Maybe "/* Only the top waiter needs to spin. If we are no longer the
top-waiter, no point in spinning, as we do not get the lock next anyway. */"

?
