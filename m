Well, in that case I think your MySQL DB is somewhat misconfigured. At
least as far as we have been consulting MySQL / MariaDB developers
regarding benchmarking, they suggested we should configure the database to
use direct IO and increase DB internal buffers instead of relying on
buffered IO and pagecache behavior. And if your fio job is representative
of the IO load the DB really creates, I'd agree that that would be a saner
and likely more performant configuration ;)

Well, I was more interested in file_write_and_wait_range() vs
ext4_sync_file() latency comparison. write(2) calls are indeed very fast
because they just copy into the page cache so that is not very interesting.
But file_write_and_wait_range() is more interesting because that measures
the cost of writing file data to the disk while whole ext4_sync_file()
measures the cost of writing file data to the disk + the cost of flushing
the journal and I'm interested in how much is the flushing of the journal
costly compared to the data writeback.
