Correct. It's an orthogonal problem and not a prerequisite for the
initial parallel bringup.

No. Changing a MTTR is done via stop_machine() on all online CPUs in
parallel. So there is no bug.

But its stupid that an update to a MTRR is not updating the cached
value, which results in this sillyness of reading back the real values
into the cache on CPU hotplug in order to set them up correctly on the
upcoming CPU.

So the real improvement would be to:

  1) Cache the MTRRs on the boot CPU once during early boot

  2) When MTRRs are changed then update the cache too

That ensures that the MTRR cache is always up to date and can be
utilized on CPU hotplug.

The 'if (state < RUNNING)' thing is just a sloppy hack which tries to
save a few cycles at boot.
