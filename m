Because that's the only way you can get this done, that's how it works,
I can't merge code that the respective maintainer finds unacceptable.

Your impression is wrong - please reconsider it. The goal is to remove
the unacceptable code from the kernel not adding to it to create even
more broken legacy. It is not against this patch or HW, it is against
this same code that there is pushback, there are no strings attached.

It is not that I don't like it, I expressed the reason why I can't merge
it above.

I can't fix it for you.

See above, let's close this argument.

So am I :)

Don't twist it that way, I think we have been clear on the matter.
