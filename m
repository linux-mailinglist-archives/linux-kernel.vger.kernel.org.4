Write uncorrectable is a very different thing, and the equivalent of the
horribly misnamed SCSI WRITE LONG COMMAND.  It injects an unrecoverable
error, and does not provision anything.

To me it sounds like you want a non-thin pool in dm-thin and/or
guaranted space reservations for it.

I think where you are trying to go here is badly mistaken.  With flash
(or hard drive SMR) there is no such thing as provisioning LBAs.  Every
write is out of place, and a one time space allocation does not help
you at all.  So fundamentally what you try to here just goes against
the actual physics of modern storage media.  While there are some
layers that keep up a pretence, trying to that an an exposed API
level is a really bad idea.
