To make sure I understand you, I think you're saying that if Function
0 has DT status "disabled", 6fffbc7ae137 ("PCI: Honor firmware's
device disabled status") breaks things because we don't enumerate
Function 0 and the driver can't temporarily claim it to zero out its
piece of the shared memory.

With just 6fffbc7ae137, we don't enumerate Function 0, which means we
don't see that it's a multi-function device, so we don't enumerate
Functions 1, 2, etc, either.

With both 6fffbc7ae137 and your current patch, we would enumerate
Functions 1, 2, etc, but we still skip Function 0, so its piece of the
shared memory still doesn't get zeroed.

If I understand correctly, something (bootloader or Linux) needs to do
something to Function 0 (e.g., clear memory).  Doing it in Linux would
minimize dependences on the bootloader, so that seems desirable to me.
That means Linux needs to enumerate Function 0 so it is visible to a
driver or possibly a quirk.

I think we could contemplate implementing 6fffbc7ae137 in a different
way.  Checking DT status at driver probe-time would probably work for
Loongson, but wouldn't quite solve the NXP problem because the driver
wouldn't be able to claim Function 0 even temporarily.

Is DT the only way to learn the NXP SERDES configuration?  I think it
would be much better if there were a way to programmatically learn it,
because then you wouldn't have to worry about syncing the DT with the
platform configuration, and it would decouple this from the Loongson
situation.

(If there were a way to actually discover the Loongson situation
instead of relying on DT, e.g., by keying off a Device ID or
something, that would be much better, too.  I assume we explored that,
but I don't remember the details.)
