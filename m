Thank you very much for your effort! Please feel free to ask any
questions you may have, without any hesitation.

Yep, that's good point. Will change it in the next version.

The Amlogic A1 clock engine comprises four clock controllers for
peripherals, PLL, CPU, and audio. While the first two have been
introduced in the current patch series, the last two will be sent in the
next iteration.
Presently, the PLL controller driver includes all the required bindings,
and the peripherals controller driver has all bindings except for the
CPU-related clock.
However, I do not believe this to be a significant issue. The clock DT
bindings are organized to simplify the process of introducing new bindings,
whether public or private. For instance, we may add new bindings to
include/dt-bindings at the end of the list and increase the overall number,
without disrupting the DT bindings ABI (the old numbers will remain
unchanged).
