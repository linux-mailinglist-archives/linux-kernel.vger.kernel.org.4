It is good for now to implement the indirect access interface in
regmap_config, as intel-m10-bmc is the only one who uses it. But I'm not
sure when a second IP block(like HSSI) in intel FPGA uses it, how to
implement? A shared library?

Some background about hardware:
Several IP blocks in intel FPGA integrate the same mmio register layout
(so called indirect access interface here) as the bridge to the IP's real
registers address space. Like:

 +---------+          +---------+
 | m10 BMC |          |  HSSI   |
 +---------+          +---------+
 |indirect |          |indirect |
 | access  |          | access  |
 |  MMIOs  |          |  MMIOs  |
 +----+----+          +----+----+
      |                    |
      |                    |
 +----+-----+         +---------+
 |m10 bmc   |         | HSSI    |
 |registers |         |registers|
 +----------+         +---------+

Thanks,
Yilun
