Is this cxl code allocating vectors for devices that might also be
claimed by portdrv?  I assume not because that sounds like a problem.

Ugh.  I always feel like the portdrv design must be sub-optimal
because this seems so hard to do cleanly.

pci_alloc_irq_vectors() has a lot of magic inside it and is great for
most drivers, but the PCIe service IRQs are definitely unusual and
maybe it's not the best fit for this situation.

If I understand correctly, Interrupt Message Numbers for all these
PCIe services (hotplug, AER, DPC, etc) are restricted to 0-31 for both
MSI and MSI-X, and the reason we don't just allocate 32 vectors all
the time is to avoid consuming too many IRQs.

The MSI case is ugly because the Interrupt Message Number can change
when we set Multiple Message Enable.  Maybe we can separate it out and
have a less than optimal solution for this case, like allocating one
or two vectors and polling if that's not enough.  I expect most
devices will support MSI-X.

For MSI-X, the vector table is in a BAR, so IIUC there's no resource
pressure until we actually assign an IRQ to a vector.  Would it be
feasible to always allocate vectors 0-31 of the MSI-X Table, and then
selectively allocate IRQs for the services we need, so we might
consume 32 MSI-X vectors but only a handful of IRQs?
