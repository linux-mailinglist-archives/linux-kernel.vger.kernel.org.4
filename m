Sorry, I follow this reasoning at all.

If folks are aiming to make a multi-arch contribution then the architecture
they regularly contribute to has absolutely zero relevance on the series
itself.

We cannot pretend the two are in no way related. The dependencies of a series
are not obvious when based on the /next branch of any one architecture.

Right, but contributors looking to make changes across architectures share
some of the burden of cross-arch coordination as well. Basing patches off of
a random commit not in Linus' tree does not match at least the arm64
workflow.

The lowest friction way to coordinate such things is to start off with a
common base and go from there. If there is a compelling argument for doing
things differently in the context of one series then let's talk about it on
the list.

This can be addressed in a merge resolution, thereby offloading the
responsibility to the maintainer.

In all likelihood, sure the series will be respun. But, you're offloading the
responsibility to ask for a sane base on other arch maintainers which I'm not
cool with.

With long term aspirations to share more code between architectures (e.g.
common MMU) I believe we'll see more changes that have meaningful interaction
with all architecutures.

I believe "Use a release candidate unless you know better" for multi-arch
changes is just as simple. Better yet, it clues in contributors as to how
changes are coordinated across architectures and might help them know better
next time around.

You've also made some suggestions about cross-arch development that do not fit
the development model of other architectures. I have no desire to nitpick
about the x86 process but want the multiarch language to actually set folks up
for success working outside of the KVM/x86 tree.
