OK. I think you need a clean-up patch to fix them first.

As my understand, perf always check the status first. If it's a stopped
or inactivated event, I don't think event->oncpu will be touched. That's
why I think the proposed driver API should be acceptable.

I'm not worry about which ways (either perf_event_disable_local() or the
proposed PT driver API) are chosen to stop the PT. If the existing
perf_event interfaces can meet your requirement, that's perfect.

My real concern is the pt_save_msr()/pt_load_msr(). I don't think it's a
job for KVM. See atomic_switch_perf_msrs(). It is the perf core driver
rather than KVM that tells which MSRs should be saved/restored in VMCS.
We should do the same thing for PT. (Actually, I think we already
encounter issues with the current KVM-dominated method. KVM
saves/restores unnecessary MSRs. Right?)

To do so, I think there may be two ways.
- Since MSRs have to be switched for both PT and core drivers, it sounds
reasonable to provide a new generic interface in the perf_event. The new
interface is to tell KVM which MSRs should be saved/restored. Then KVM
can decide to save/restore via VMCS or direct MSR access. I suspect this
way requires big change, but it will benefit all the drivers which have
similar requirements.
- The proposed driver API. The MSRs are saved/restored in the PT driver.


Thanks,
