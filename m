Because this interface was a bad idea to start with and its
implementation is questionable at the design level.

Granted, at the time it was introduced, there was no alternative, but
there is the AML debugger in the kernel now and as far as debugging is
concerned, it is actually more powerful than custom_metod AFAICS.  See
Documentation/firmware-guide/acpi/aml-debugger.rst.

If the AML debugger has problems, I would very much prefer fixing them
to the perpetual maintenance of custom_method.

It's been always conceptually questionable, problematic from the
security standpoint and implemented poorly.  Also its documentation is
outdated.

The patches fixing its most apparent functional issues don't actually
address much of the above.

The AML debugger should really be used for debug rather than
custom_method and honestly, what's the purpose of it beyond debug?
