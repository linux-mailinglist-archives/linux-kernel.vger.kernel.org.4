Yes, a real-life example is the need for a 32Khz clock for an external
wifi chip. There is one option to provide this clock with high
precision, which is RTC + GENCLK.

I don't think so. The highest precision that RTC can provide is from a
32KHz rate only. However, I believe that a 1kHz frequency can also be
achieved by using xtal 24MHz with a divider, which can provide high
precision as well.

Agreed, this API works well for protecting the rate changes. However, I
do not think it covers the scenario where we want to change the rate but
still retain the parent (if it has already been assigned from the dts).

Hmm, I couldn't find how accuracy is used in the logic. It seems that
only the clk_summary contains information on accuracy.

I actually do not like my approach very much. CCF is not very flexible,
yet at the same time it does not allow for strict rules to be set for
the clock. With my approach, each developer would have to set up
assigned clocks directly from the device tree. However, if we back all
clocks inherited from RTC to the reparenting process, we can lose
assigned clocks for the RTC state.

As I mentioned earlier, I believe the best solution is to change CCF to
provide a new 'assigned-clocks-exclusive' mechanism while protecting the
clock from parent changing. I can provide an RFC patch for this if you
do not mind.

However, I think it is necessary to move forward with that patch series
since many other meson-a1.dtsi changes depend on it. We can merge the
current driver implementation as is, and after the CCF has an exclusive
assigned-clocks mechanism, then I will rework this driver.
Alternatively, I can revert all PARENT flags back and change the logic,
if it becomes necessary in the future on upstream boards.
