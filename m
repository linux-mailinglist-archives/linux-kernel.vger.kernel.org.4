Yeah, that's fine too.

:-D

Actually when I was replying I explicitly didn't use page_count() to make
sure we're reading the tail page, but I just noticed that's exactly the way
how we identify the special page with a PageCompound()==true tail page.

Yeah, if we'd like that it needs to be page_count()==0.

So it's probably that I totally have no idea what are the attributes for
those special pages so I don't understand enough on why we need to handle
those pages differently from e.g. PFNMAP pages, and also the benefits.

I think what I can tell is that they're pages that doesn't have
PageCompound bits set on either head or tails, however it's still a
multi-2-order large page.  Is there an example on how these pages are used
and allocated?  Why would we need those pages, and whether these pages need
to be set dirty/accessed after all?

This looks like a good thing to have, indeed.  But again it doesn't seem
like anything special to the pages we're discussing here, say, !Compound &&
refcount==0 ones.
