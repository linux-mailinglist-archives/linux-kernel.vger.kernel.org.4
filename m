Hi,
I see that there is no response for more than two weeks on this driver, 
is there some problem with it? The XDMA driver is required for our mgb4
v4l2 driver to work:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20221123140431.4730-2-tumic@gpxsee.org/

The patches not being included in the kernel block the progress on our 
driver as it naturally fails to compile and as a result the willingness 
to deal with our patch is quiet low among the v4l2 people... Thanks for 
any help.

Martin Tůma
