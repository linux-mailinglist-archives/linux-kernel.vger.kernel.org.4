Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker.

That afaics was the last mail in this thread about a regression caused
by ad44ac082fd ("regulator: qcom-rpmh: Revert "regulator: qcom-rpmh: Use
PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS"") from Doug; Amit's attempt to patch it (
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230602161246.1855448-1-amit.pundir@linaro.org/
) also wasn't welcomed. Just like his earlier revert attempt
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230515145323.1693044-1-amit.pundir@linaro.org/
).

Does this mean this regression won't be addressed before 6.4 is
released? Or was there some progress and I just missed it? What should I
tell Linus in my next report?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
