We have some machines with ASPEED SATA controllers, and are seeing the same NCQ
issues that ATI controllers (I am not sure if it's a rebranded ATI controller,
or they both have some faulty implementation). This NCQ breakage is consistent
across a few different types of drives.

Instead of maintaining a list of drives that are broken with ASPEED controllers
as well as AIT, let's just treat ASPEED controllers like ATI ones, and disable
NCQ on drives that have ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_ATI set on them.

To do this first, we have to make move the definition of the ASPEED vendor from
the ast drm driver to the PCI subsystem.
