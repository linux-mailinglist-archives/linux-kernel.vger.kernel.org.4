Regardless of where the problem is etc, if my understanding of the
patch is correct, it is proposing to change the behavior of a
well-known sysfs interface in a way that is likely to be incompatible
with at least some of its users.  This is an obvious no-go in kernel
development and I would expect you to be well aware of it.

IOW, if you want the cached value to be returned, a new interface (eg.
a new sysfs attribute) is needed.

And I think that the use case is not really i2c sensors in general,
because at least in some cases they work just fine AFAICS, but a
platform with a control loop running in the kernel that depends on
sensor reads carried out at a specific, approximately constant, rate
that can be disturbed by user space checking the sensor temperature
via sysfs at "wrong" times.  If at the same time the user space
program in question doesn't care about the most recent values reported
by the sensor, it may very well use the values cached by the in-kernel
control loop.
