In general, I agree with your sentiments about an initcall being a preferred
solution.

But when I was looking at the suggested alternatives, I noticed one sticking
point.  The new setup_of() calls unflatten_device_tree(), which calls
unittest_unflatten_overlay_base().  The call to unittest_unflatten_overlay_base()
is deliberately very early in the boot, so that the memory allocator used
for this very small portion of the devicetree nodes created for unittest
is the same early boot allocator that is used to unflatten an FDT passed
to the kernel from a bootloader.

Digging through this led me to another issue.  I have not tested this patch
series on a user mode linux kernel (on my todo list...).  For user mode linux,
unittest_data_add() is called directly from the late initcall of_unittest().
So for user mode linux, unittest_data_add() will be called a second time - I
need to remove that second call and make sure unittest still works on user
mode linux.

Agreed, I guess I was too subtle with "did not seem like a good choice". :-)
