Setting a reasonable maximum is fine - but make sure the code then fails with
a suitable error message if there are more!

I don't particularly mind.  This convention was new to me.

Maybe. The bus, devfn, reg part is standard bdf, but I don't think
the PCI 6.0 spec defined a version with the seg in the upper bits.
I'm not sure if we want to adopt that in LInux.

You can't do that because another vendor could use the same VSEC ID for
an entirely different purpose. They are only valid in combination with the device VID.

The only way this can work is with a list of specific vendor ID / VSEC pairs for
known devices.

Gah. This is what DVSEC was defined to solve. It lets you have a common
vendor defined extended capability defined by a vendor, independent of the
VID of a given device.  With a VSEC you can't write generic code.

No, though hopefully we'll get to some sort of plan in the branch of this thread
that Bjorn comment in.

Agreed. Unfortunately that's all you can do safely as VSEC IDs are not a global
namespace.

If I understand correctly the only safe way to read this is in a try / retry loop.
Read the upper part, then the lower part, then reread the upper part.
If the upper part is unchanged you did not get ripping across the two registers.
If it changes, try again.

pcie_index will be set to the index of the PMU device that failed - so loops backwards
from that removing them.

Ah. I was reviewing backwards so when I wrote this hadn't realized you walk
the PCI topology.   PCI driver topology is the right solution here.
