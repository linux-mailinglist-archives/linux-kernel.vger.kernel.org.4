Are you okay if I just paste your very fine explanation verbatim, with 
credits?

TGID or thread group leader. For single threaded userspace TGID equals 
to PID, while for multi-threaded first thread TGID equals PID/TID, while 
additional threads PID/TID does not equal TGID. Clear, as mud? :) My 
POSIX book is misplaced somewhere having not consulted it years... :)
