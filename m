The commit message is out of date (sorry about that). A previous version
of the spec had a dedicated member for the read/write value, but this
was changed to just use GPRS[0] as you've spotted. I'll update the text.

Yes, when entering the guest after an (emulatable) read data abort the
value in GPRS[0] is loaded from the RecEntry structure into the
appropriate register for the guest.

The RMM will populate GPRS[0] with the written value in this case (even
if another register was actually used in the instruction). We then
transfer that to the usual VCPU structure so that the normal fault
handling logic works.

Correct. Although there's no harm in updating with vcpu_set_reg(). But
I'll make the change because it's clearer.

Yes, that makes sense - I'll move this.

Thanks,
