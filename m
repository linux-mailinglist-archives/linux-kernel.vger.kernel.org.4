I assume its SMT2 here. sched group is enclosed in [busy_cpus/idle_cpus/weight] 

Lets take an example:  we will begin the with the said imbalance.
[3/9/12] -- local group 
[3/1/4] -- busy group. 
we will evaluate 3*12 > (4*(3+1)) is true and proceeds further to balance. 
but calculate_imbalance will lead to zero as the imbalance no? in case of prefer sibling 
case it find the difference of sum_nr_running of the two groups. It will be 3-3 = 0

this would need modifications to calculate_imbalance. 
Maybe something like this will help? NOT TESTED AT ALL.

On a tangential dimension.


Since prefer_siblings make inherent assumption that all groups have equal weight, 
it will cause  complications when group_weights are different. I think that becomes very
tricky when there are more than two groups. Depending on which cpu is doing 
load_balance there can be unnecessary migrations. 


Currently even in NUMA this can be similar case right? There will be unequal number of CPU's right? 
If we fix that case and remove prefer siblings in your arch, will that work? 

Maybe something like this? NOT TESTED AT ALL.
