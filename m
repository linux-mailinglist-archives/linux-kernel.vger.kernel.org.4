Oswald, this looks like a real regression by the patch.
Specially, this happens with dmix, and the issue doesn't seem specific
to the driver.  It happens also with USB-audio, not only with
HD-audio.  Just aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Side_Left.wav or whatever
there with the dmix config showed the problem.

The dmix uses the silence_size=boundary as a fill-all operation, and
it's a free-wheel mode, so supposedly something was overlooked in your
code refactoring.

Could you check it and address quickly?  I'd like to fix it before
6.4-rc1 release, so if no fix comes up in a couple of days, I'll have
to revert the change for 6.4-rc1.


thanks,

Takashi
