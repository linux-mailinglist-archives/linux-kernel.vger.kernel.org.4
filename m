If you diff the outputs side by side you can see it mainly has an effect
where there is a discontinuity. At this point we set either the from or
the to IPs to 0.

For example here is a before and after perf script output. Without the
change it looks like stress was running before it actually was. The
schedule function that was attributed to ls on the first line hasn't
finished running yet. But it's attributed to stress on the second line
even though the destination IP is 0 meaning we don't even know where it
went.

Before:

    ls  8350 [006] ... __schedule+0x394 => schedule+0x5c
stress  8357 [006] ... schedule+0x84 => 0 [unknown]
stress  8357 [006] ... 0 [unknown] => __unix_dgram_recvmsg+0x130

After:

    ls  8350 [006] ... __schedule+0x394 => schedule+0x5c
    ls  8357 [006] ... schedule+0x84 => 0 [unknown]
stress  8357 [006] ... 0 [unknown] => __unix_dgram_recvmsg+0x130

I didn't see any decode differences that weren't around these
discontinuity points, so it seems like a low risk change.

Yeah that might make more sense. I can move it there if we decide to
keep this change.
