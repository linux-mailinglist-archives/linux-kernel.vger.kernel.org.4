Thank you, Eric.

For complete separation of certificate usage, at least in the "max" CA
restriction case, the next step would be to limit certificates being
loaded onto the IMA keyring to those with key usage of
"digitalSignature".

Perhaps also require a "codeSigning" extendedKeyUsage, though that
might break existing usages.  The "codeSigning" checking could
piggyback on Joey's proposed "Check codeSigning extended key usage
extension" patch set.

What do you think?  Do you have any concerns with limiting the type of
certificate being loaded onto the IMA keyring to those with
"digitalSignature"?
