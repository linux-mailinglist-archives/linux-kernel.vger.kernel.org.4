Thanks for providing additional context, Kumar. So what do we want to do
for this patch set? IMO it doesn't seem useful to restrict
bpf_kfunc_acquire() to only be callable by non-sleepable programs if our
goal is to avoid crashes for nested task structs. We could easily
accidentally crash if e.g. those pointers are NULL, or someone is doing
something weird like stashing some extra flag bits in unused portions of
the pointer which are masked out when it's actually dereferenced
regardless of whether we're in RCU.  Trusting ctx loads sounds like the
right approach, barring some of the challenges you pointed out such as
dealing with fexit paths after free where the object may not be valid
anymore.

In general, it seems like we should maybe decide on what our policy
should be for kfuncs until we can wire up whatever we need to properly
trust ctx.
