I think that's simply because the PMU support was hung off the existing 
PL310 configuration code, which still supports non-DT boardfiles. The 
PMU shouldn't strictly need to be registered that early, it would just 
be a bunch more work to ensure that a platform device is available for 
it to bind to as a regular driver model driver, which wasn't justifiable 
at the time.

Thanks,
Robin.
