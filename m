It's a long-standing issue, so no urgent fix is needed.
It can be postponed to 6.4 merge.

Agreed.

Heh, we had occasionally a "hot fix" patch for avoiding to point to
the non-existing versions for distro kernels.

Right, this may end up with too many files.
Although there were recent actions in linux-firmware tree to drop the
unused versions, there are still quite many in total, and iwlwifi
firmware files are relatively large, unfortunately.

As of now, using the wildcard for matching all iwlwifi firmware files
would be worse for us, as it'll lead to drag all those files into the
openSUSE/SUSE installer image and grow the image size significantly.
=46rom that POV, the current MODULE_FIRMWARE() has been working "good
enough"; as already mentioned, we occasionally fix in the downstream
side to point to the existing firmware version, but that's OK-ish.
