Ever since base DT support for Pinephone Pro was merged, none of the DT patches
in my tree are in the original form as prepared by the authors + fixes I've
added. That's simply impossible anymore.

To look up who did what, you'd have to look at older branches, pre-merge.

Patches after the merge just came from squashing everything into one patch,
cleaning it up, and re-splitting along some vague functionality boundaries,
while trying to keep best-effort original SoBs as faithfully as possible, so
that I can keep maintaining the PPP support in a sane manner.

Anyway, SoB's are added in chronological order. So:

https://github.com/megous/linux/commit/471c5f33ba74c3d498ccc1eb69c098623b193926

Means the author of the changes is Martijn + Kamil (roughly) and I may have
a line of code in there too, since my SoB is last. For some reason, the order is
inverted in the patch you posted, making it seem I developed these changes
originally.

Having wrong frequency used is not a missing support for something. Sorry it's
too bothersome to get the review piecemeal, but sometimes people have more time to
look at patches in-depth, and at other times they don't and you just get surface
level or no review.

One point of posting patches to the mailing list is to get review. And it's not
that great to do in-depth review for you, up to going through schematics and
datasheets, testing, and even proposing and testing solutions for found issues,
just to be dismissed without technical reason.

The thing is this review will most likely happen just once, and noone will go
back, read through the entire huge DT along with a schematic, to look at whether
this or that pullup is really necessary, whether some parameter is out of spec
from the datasheet for each part, or things like that. That's just not
pragmatic.

Instead, people will happily attribute non-obvious issues caused by these
omissions of manual review to shoddy or slow or power-inefficient HW. "1kHz
+ harmonics interference in codec because high power backlight DC-DC regulator
basically spews off 1kHz of 1-2W load + harmonics because it's driven
incorrectly? Ah, the phone just has a shitty audio codec!"

So, don't take it as some perfectionism. Upstreaming just seems like the best
time to look at things that were overlooked in the past in more detail and get
these little things right, because the DT additions are done piecemal and
slowly/gradually, so it's more manageable to review and fix right away. This
will just not happen later on for these obscure devices like Pinephone Pro,
where the whole effort that goes into it is like one half of a fulltime
developer time split over 4 mildly interested real persons, slowly tapering off
over time as the device ages.
