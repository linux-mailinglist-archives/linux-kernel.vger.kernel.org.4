OK, thanks, I didn't see one either, which surprised me.

Based on the weird exception in sec 6.5.4:

  Since the [PCI_Config operation region on a PCI root bus containing
  a _BBN object] is permanently available, no _REG methods are
  required, nor will OSPM evaluate any _REG methods that appear in the
  same scope as the operation region declaration(s) of this type.

it seems like when we add a PCI host bridge, we should evaluate any
_REG in the host bridge scope if it does not include _BBN.

The example:

  It should be noted that PCI Config Space Operation Regions are ready
  as soon the host controller or bridge controller has been programmed
  with a bus number. PCI1’s _REG method would not be run until the
  PCI-PCI bridge has been properly configured.

suggests that when we set a PCI-PCI bridge's secondary bus number, we
should evaluate any _REG in its scope.

  At the same time, the OS will also run ETH0’s _REG method since its
  PCI Config Space would be also available. The OS will again run
  ETH0’s _REG method when the ETH0 device is started.

So evidently we should evaluate ETH0._REG once after setting PCI1's
secondary bus number, and again when "ETH0 is started."  I have no
idea what "started" means.

Thanks for taking a look at it!

I think we're missing some other _REG stuff, but it seems like what
this patch adds does match the per-endpoint power management requires,
so I applied these to pci/pm for v6.5.
