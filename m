Thanks for pointing out the limitations of the current overlay 
architecture. Can a careful orchestration of overlay creation and tear 
down by each driver address the limitation? I did see another user, 
drivers/pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c, which seems to be using the overlay 
infrastructure in this manner.

What is your suggestion to move forward?
