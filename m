In older discussions there are comments like, "Any CA certificate, no
matter if it's a root or an intermediate, must have the keyCertSign
extension. If you want to sign a revocation list (CRL) with the CA
certificate as well (you usually do want that), than you have to add
cRLSign as well. Any other keyUsages can and should be avoided for CA
certificates."

The question as to "why" this changed to include "digitalSignature" was
posed here [2] with the response being for "OCSP".   It also includes a
link to Entrusts root and intermediate CAs with just keyCertSign and
cRLSign keyUsages.

The matchine keyring is a means of establishing a new root of trust. 
The motivation for further restricting CA certificates to just
keyCertSign and cRLSign keyUsages is to limit how the CA certificates
may be used.  They should not be used for code signing.
