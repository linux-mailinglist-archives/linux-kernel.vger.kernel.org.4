We'll see.

I guess we can do that. And I even think we have some code which finds
out which the NBC is...

/me greps a bit:

ah, there it is: get_nbc_for_node() in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/inject.c.

Can't. It is user-visible and you don't know for sure whether someone is
using it or not.

Believe me, I have been wanting to disable this thing forever. I've
never heard of anyone using it and all the energy we put in it was for
nothing. :-\

We could try to deprecate it, though, make it default=n in Kconfig and
see who complains. And after a couple of releases, kill it.

Of course it is documented - it is in the old BKDGs.

Yap.

Clean it up how exactly?

Put it behind a Kconfig item, disable it and remove it after a while?

:-)

If so, I wouldn't mind. No one's using this. At least I haven't heard of
a single bug report or of a use case. Only when CPU hotplug explodes and
that thing is involved, only then.

Might as well remove it. And then remove it in the hardware too. RAS
folks would love to get rid of some of that crap which takes up verif
resources for no good reason.

:-)
