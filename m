I'm not quite sure what you're asking here.  A driver would learn
about a graceful removal when its .remove() method is called before
the device is physically removed.  The device is still accessible and
everything should just work.

A driver would learn about a surprise removal either by a read result
that is PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR() or possibly when its .error_detected()
callback is called.  The .remove() method will eventually be called
when we destroy the pci_dev.

I guess .remove() might use pci_device_is_present() and assume that if
it returns "true", this is a graceful removal.  But that's not
reliable since the device could be physically removed between the
pci_device_is_present() call and the driver's next access to it.

I think the best thing would be for .remove() to just do whatever it
needs to do and look for errors, e.g., using PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR(),
without relying on pci_device_is_present().

If .remove() wants to avoid doing something that might cause an error,
maybe we should expose pci_dev_is_disconnected().  That's set by the
hotplug remove paths before .remove() is called and feels a little
less racy.
