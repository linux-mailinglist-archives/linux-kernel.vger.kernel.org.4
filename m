No, I haven't. I'm repeating what was said:

 during DMA I/O an RMP_PAGE_FAULT is observed on the host.

So, I'm interested to hear how you can get a RMP_PAGE_FAULT from the
IOMMU if the IOMMU is only programmed with shared pages that, by (my)
definition, are accessible to the CPU and should not generate a
RMP_PAGE_FAULT?

I think you are confusing my use of the word private with some AMD
architecture deatils. When I say private I mean that the host CPU will
generate a violation if it tries to access the memory.

I think the conclusion is logical - if the IOMMU is experiencing a
protection violation it is because the IOMMU was programed with PFNs
it is not allowed to access - and so why was that even done in the
first place?

I suppose what is going on is you program the IOPTEs with PFNs of
unknown state and when the PFN changes access protections the IOMMU
can simply use it without needing to synchronize with the access
protection change. And your problem is that the granularity of access
protection change does not match the IOPTE granularity in the IOMMU.

But this seems very wasteful as the IOMMU will be using IOPTEs and
also will pin the memory when the systems *knows* this memory cannot
be accessed through the IOMMU. It seems much better to dynamically
establish IOMMU mappings only when you learn that the memory is
actually accesisble to the IOMMU.

Also, I thought the leading plan for CC was to use the memfd approach here:

https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20220915142913.2213336-1-chao.p.peng@linux.intel.com/

Which prevents mmaping the memory to userspace - so how did it get
into the IOMMU in the first place?
