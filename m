My assumption was this sequence is something like this, where firmware
*can't* collect error status from devices below the Downstream Port
because DPC has been triggered and they are not accessible:

  - Hardware triggers DPC in a Downstream Port
  - Firmware fields error interrupt
  - Firmware captures Downstream Port error info (devices below are
    not accessible because of DPC)
  - Firmware sends EDR Notify to OS
  - OS brings Downstream Port out of DPC
  - OS collects error status from devices below Downstream Port
  - OS evaluates _OST
  - Firmware captures error status from devices below Downstream Port

But that doesn't explain why *firmware* could not clear the error
status of those devices after it captures it.

I guess the flowchart *does* show firmware clearing the error status
in the "do not continue recovery" path.
