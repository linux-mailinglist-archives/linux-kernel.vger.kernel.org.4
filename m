The 2 new users is for the cpuset cpu partition which is used to create 
a secondary scheduling domain and hence have to call 
rebuilds_sched_domains() to set it up. Those should not be used that 
frequently.

Yes, it seems like we have to check every tasks in the system to see if 
they are dl tasks. It can be expensive if there are a large number of 
tasks. Maybe we should track the # of dl tasks in each cgroup and skip 
this operation if there is none.
