User of this is qemu.  It can use the udmabuf driver to create host
dma-bufs for guest resources (virtio-gpu buffers), to avoid copying
data when showing the guest display in a host window.

hugetlb support is needed in case qemu guest memory is backed by
hugetlbfs.  That does not imply the virtio-gpu buffers are hugepage
aligned though, udmabuf would still need to operate on smaller chunks
of memory.  So with additional restrictions this will not work any
more for qemu.  I'd suggest to just revert hugetlb support instead
and go back to the drawing board.

Also not sure why hugetlbfs is used for guest memory in the first place.
It used to be a thing years ago, but with the arrival of transparent
hugepages there is as far I know little reason to still use hugetlbfs.

Vivek? Dongwon?

take care,
