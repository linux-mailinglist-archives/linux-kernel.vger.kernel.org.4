Right. With CAP_BPF and some other CAPs enabled.

No, you can't create a new bpf namespace as a non-root, see also
copy_namespaces().
In the container environment, new namespaces are always created by
containered, which is started by root.

> Maybe add a paragraph about now vs whatever you're proposing.

What I'm proposing in this patchset is to put bpf objects (map, prog,
link, and btf) into the bpf namespace. Next step I will put bpffs into
the bpf namespace as well.
That said, I'm trying to put  all the objects created in bpf into the
bpf namespace. Below is a simple paragraph to illustrate it.

Regarding the unpriv user with CAP_BPF enabled,
                                                             Now | Future
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iterate his BPF IDs                                | N   |  Y  |
Iterate others' BPF IDs                          | N   |  N  |
Convert his BPF IDs to FDs                  | N   |  Y  |
Convert others' BPF IDs to FDs            | N   |  N  |
Get others' object info from pinned file  | Y(*) | N  |
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(*) It can be improved by,
     1). Different containers has different bpffs
     2). Setting file permission
     That's not perfect, for example, if one single user has two bpf
instances, but we don't want them to inspect each other.
