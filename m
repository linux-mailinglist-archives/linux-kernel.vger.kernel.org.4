Not all PCI devices  some PCI devices like NVMe. The NVMe driver is 
expecting the device to stay in D0 only.

Yes, it is the NVMe driver who is deciding to keep the device in D0. Our 
QCOM
PCI Controller driver is trying to keep the device in the same state as 
the client driver is
expecting and also trying to reduce power consumption.

I don't think after the link enters into L1.x there will some activity 
on the link as you mentioned,
except for PCIe messages like INTx/MSI/MSIX. These messages also will 
not come because the
client drivers like NVMe will keep their device in the lowest power mode.

The link will come out of L1.x only when there is config or memory 
access or some messages
to trigger the interrupts from the devices. We are already making sure 
this access will not be there in S3.
If the link is in L0 or L0s what you said is expected but not in L1.x
