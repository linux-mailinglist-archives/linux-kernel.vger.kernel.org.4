No, that's not the goal of the change.  KVM already hides features in the VMX MSRs
if the base feature is not supported in L1 according to guest CPUID.  The problem
is that, currently, KVM also _forces_ features to be enabled in the VMX MSRs when
the base feature IS supported in L1 (CPUID).

Ideally, KVM should NEVER manipulate VMX MSRs in response to guest CPUID changes.
That's what I was referring to earlier by commits:

  8805875aa473 ("Revert "KVM: nVMX: Do not expose MPX VMX controls when guest MPX disabled"")
  9389d5774aca ("Revert "KVM: nVMX: Expose load IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL"")

E.g. if userspace sets VMX MSRs and then sets guest CPUID, KVM will override the
nVMX CPU model defined by userspace.  The scenario where userspace hides a "base"
feature but exposes the feature in the VMX MSRs is nonsensical, which is why I
think KVM can likely get away with force-disabling features.

The reverse is completely legitimate though: hiding a feature in VMX MSRs even if
the base feature is supported for L1, i.e. disallowing L1 from enabling the feature
in L2, is something that real VMMs will actually do, e.g. if the user doesn't trust
that KVM correctly handles all aspects of nested virtualization for the feature.

In other words, the behavior you're observing, where vmx->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high
is changed by vmx_adjust_secondary_exec_control(), is a completely separate bug
than the one below.

You missed the qualifier:

  If KVM doesn't correctly support virtualizing user wait/pause for L2

If KVM should NOT be exposing ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE to the L1 VMM, then NOT
propagating the feature to msrs->secondary_ctls_low is correct.  And if that's
the case, then vmx_secondary_exec_control() needs to be modified so that it does
NOT set ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE in vmx->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high.

> Could we just change nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs() like below:

If KVM correctly virtualizes the feature in a nested scenario, yes.  I haven't
looked into ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE enough to know whether or not KVM gets the
nested virtualization pieces correct, hence the above qualifier.
