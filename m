I am not sure if I would be able to join but will look into this and get back to you soon. 

In fact, joining efforts will be awesome!

As for cdev statistics, I believe the transition table is an overkill. And for the cases I have been using,
with 20+ thermal zones with 10+ cdevs assgined to all of thermal zones, is way beyond the PAGE limit size.
Totally agree with that.

I agree this code deserves a cleanup. These patches build on top of what is currently in mainline.
I also would prefer to have this code potentially out of the -sysfs file and handled separately
from the actual sysfs node handling code.

As for the debugfs vs sysfs, the rule of thumb I use here is more if I need this into a production system
or not. The content of the cdev and thermal zone stats can in fact be interpreted in both ways:
(a) on a purely debug image for a developer to check governor behavior etc, which corroborates to your view,
but also (b) in an actual production system where statistics and residency are collected in the entire
population of devices running a particular governor/settings. In the later case, debugfs is not the best fit.

I will take a closer look on the above. Thanks for sharing.
