It says so in the warning which one it is: -Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized

Don't know if we enable that one for clang with W= or Nathan adds
additional switches.

I still wanted to go through the rest but I'm not sure I'll have time
for it before the merge window. So unless this is breaking some silly
testing scenario, I'd say I'll leave things as they are.

Once I take yours, that silly false positive will go away and we can
forget about it.

Dunno, I'd say with false positives we have bigger fish to fry...

Thx.
