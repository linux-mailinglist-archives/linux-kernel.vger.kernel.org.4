It's definitely possible.  And there's no reason to limit this to a u32, I =
really
have no idea why I did that.=20

Ah, it's because "struct kvm_vcpu_arch" is defined in arch/x86/include/asm/=
kvm_host.h,
and I didn't want to expose governed_features.h in arch/x86/include/asm.  H=
rm,
that's really annoying.

Aha!  A better workaround for that conudrum would be to define an explicit =
"max"
and use that, with a FIXME to call out that this really should use
KVM_NR_GOVERNED_FEATURES directly.  I have aspirations of moving kvm_host.h=
 to
arch/<arch>/kvm, at which point this can be cleaned up by declaring "enum
kvm_governed_features" in kvm_host.h (though it'll likely be named somethin=
g
like kvm_arch.h at that point).

	/*
	 * FIXME: Drop this macro and use KVM_NR_GOVERNED_FEATURES directly
	 * when "struct kvm_vcpu_arch" is no longer defined in an
	 * arch/x86/include/asm header.  The max is mostly arbitrary, i.e.
	 * can be increased as necessary.
	 */
#define KVM_MAX_NR_GOVERNED_FEATURES BITS_PER_LONG

Yes, this definitely should return a bool.

Thanks!
