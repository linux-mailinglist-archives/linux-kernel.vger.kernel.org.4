That's not an argument... everything can be a "hardware need".

And how do you solve poking into the same register by two devices? Who
owns it? You don't...

I see at least an idea - create proper hierarchy, where parent device
instantiates its children (thus knows and increments the IDs) and is
responsible for proper handling of shared register (thus the parent owns
the register).

I understand why you created vdevnum/fepnum properties but the reason is
not matching DT bindings. These are not additional hardware properties
which deserve their own DT properties - they are already part of unit
address and/or just incremented ID based on device number managed by a
parent.

Krzysztof
