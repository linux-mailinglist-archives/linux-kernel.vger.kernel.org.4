If this patch fixes a crash, then it should be

Cc: <stable@kernel.org>

If there are prerequisites to it, they should be CC:stable too.

So looking at the urgent stuff: patches 1, 3, I'm thinking I can take them
through the EDAC tree and send them to Linus now, after you've addressed the
review comments.

This one can go through some other tree, I presume, but since it fixes a crash
it should go in now too...

Please use passive voice in your commit message: no "we" or "I", etc,
and describe your changes in imperative mood.

Personal pronouns are ambiguous in text, especially with so many
parties/companies/etc developing the kernel so let's avoid them please.

With the above addressed, for the EDAC bits:
