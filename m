Apologies, I've been busy and this series got buried in my inbox before 
I'd clocked it as something I was supposed to be looking at.

Setting a 64-bit mask should never fail, especially on any platform that 
will actually run this code.

Can this can ever happen? AFAICS there's no ACPI binding to match and 
probe the DWC driver, at best it could only probe as a standard PNP0A08 
host bridge which wouldn't know anything about eDMA anyway.

Ugh, I guess this is still here because now you're passing the channel 
device to of_dma_configure() such that it looks like a PCI child :(

Can we just set "chan->dev->device.of_node = dev->of_node;" beforehand 
so it works as expected (with f1ad5338a4d5 in place) and we don't need 
to be messing with the dma_range_map details at all? Note that that 
isn't as hacky as it might sound - it's a relatively well-established 
practice in places like I2C and SPI, and in this case it seems perfectly 
appropriate semantically as well.

(And there should be no need to bother with of_node refcounting, since 
the lifetime of the eDMA driver is bounded by the lifetime of the PCIe 
driver, thus the lifetime of the DMA channel devices is bounded by the 
lifetime of the PCIe platform device, which already holds a reference 
from of_device_alloc().)

Thanks,
Robin.
