It's not just nf_conn___init. Some CT helpers also take nf_conn.
e.g. bpf_ct_change_timeout, bpf_ct_change_status.
Right now they are only allowed in XDP and TC programs, so the tracing
args part is not a problem _right now_.

So currently it may not be possible to pass such a trusted but
ref_obj_id == 0 nf_conn to those helpers.
But based on changes unrelated to this, it may become possible in the
future to obtain such a trusted nf_conn pointer.
It is hard to then go and audit all possible cases where this can be
passed into helpers/kfuncs.

It is a requirement of those kfuncs that the nf_conn has its refcount
held while they are called.
KF_TRUSTED_ARGS was encoding this requirement before, but it wouldn't anymore.
It seems better to me to keep that restriction instead of relaxing it,
if it is part of the contract.

It is fine to not require people to dive into these details and just
use KF_TRUSTED_ARGS in general, but we need something to cover special
cases like these where the object is only stable while we hold an
active refcount, RCU protection is not enough against reuse.

It could be 'expert only' __ref suffix on the nf_conn arg, or
KF_OWNED_ARGS, or something else.

I do like the allowlist vs denylist point from Alexei. It was also
what I originally suggested in [0], but when I went looking, pointer
walking is really the only case that was problematic, which was being
marked by PTR_WALKED. The other case of handling fexit is unrelated to
both.
But it's always better to be safe than sorry.
