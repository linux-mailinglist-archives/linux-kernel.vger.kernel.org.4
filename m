I'm not the original author, and I can only answer now based on my understanding. Maybe
the original author didn't think of the hash method, or he has weighed it out.

Hash is a good solution if only performance is required and memory overhead is not
considered. Using hash will increase the memory size by up to "4 * kallsyms_num_syms +
4 * ARRAY_SIZE(hashtable)" bytes, kallsyms_num_syms is about 1-2 million.

Because I don't know what hash algorithm will be used, the cost of generating the
hash value corresponding to the symbol name is unknown now. But I think it's gonna
be small. But it definitely needs a simpler algorithm, the tool needs to implement
the same hash algorithm.

If the hash is not very uniform or ARRAY_SIZE(hashtable) is small, then my current
approach still makes sense. So maybe hash can be deferred to the next phase of
improvement.
