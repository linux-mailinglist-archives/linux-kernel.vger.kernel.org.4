This goes too far, because it causes all ports, not just root ports.

If the intention is to address a problem with a root port, then the
change in behavior should be limited to root ports.

And yes, you can argue that for root ports, specifically, power
management without firmware support is rather pointless if not
harmful.

Do you mean the cutoff date?

For root ports - probably.  In general - not at all.
