Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

As Linus will likely release 6.4 on this or the following Sunday a quick
status inquiry so I can brief him appropriately: is there any hope the
regression this patch tried to fix will be resolved any time soon?
Doesn't look like it from below message and this thread, but maybe I
missed something.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
