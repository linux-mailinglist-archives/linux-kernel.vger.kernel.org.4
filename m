Is it at all possible to simply drop efi support for 32bit builds?

Last I looked (and it was quite a while ago) efi was only supported
same architecture.  So we are talking about 32bit efi for 32bit kernels.

I think there were only a handful of systems that ever shipped 32bit
efi, because when 32bit efi came out 64bit processors had been shipping
for several years already.

We still probably need to deal with whatever is needed for the BIOS.

If there are enough interesting systems to care to keep the few systems
that shipped with 32bit efi support going it probably does make sense to
change how it is implemented because using the kernel's page tables has
been nasty and given kexec all kinds of challenges to support because
not only does efi happen strange mapping attributes but efi also winds
up living at a fixed virtual address, that can't be changed.  So if you
care about anything like address space layout randomization efi provides
a well know fixed target that defeats all of your work there as well.

Can we do something to isolate 32bit efi so it is not a painpoint?

Given how long 8bit and 16bit systems have lasted I rather suspect 32bit
x86 will last in some embedded form for a very long time.  PAE came in
about the first pentium's I think so most embedded i386 processors
should support it.
