Yes, pktcdvd tools (pktsetup, pktcdvd-check, cdrwtool) are (for
historical reasons) in udftools project. Ok, maybe it is unintuitive to
find them here but it is documented in kernel tree.

Yes. In Kconfig option which is being removed, is a documentation link

-	  See the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/packet-writing.rst>
-	  for further information on the use of this driver.

Yes, in more cases it is not easy. But in this case, when kernel in-tree
documentation about this driver was updated in the last year, it is lot
of easier than in other cases to get more information about it.

I sent this patch to keep links up-to-date for packet-writing.rst file:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20220210192200.30828-1-pali@kernel.org/
(and it was merged)

In documentation are mentioned 3 projects which are related to packet
writing and all have valid homepages with contact information.

I agree that finding out such information is hard. But do not take me
wrong, but if people are lazy and do not look into in-tree kernel
documentation and check it, then I'm loosing motivation to keep in-tree
kernel documentation up-to-date...
