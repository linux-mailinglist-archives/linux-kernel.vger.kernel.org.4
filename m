We could. I just feel this is a corner case and user have an alternative
to use address directly. This is just my opinion though.

Yes, I am okay with this approach. This will prevent user mistaking
kprobe a wrong function and this is what we want for now.

As I mentioned in the above, we can do the minimum work in the
beginning to prevent user errors. I agree that it may not be
worthwhile to support those just ~100 static functions with
more BTF types and kernel codes. Users already have alternatives.

I assume consistent static function representations means
total match of function signature (return type, func name,
parameter type, parameter name).

This should work. But if we do find multiple instances of
the same function. I think it would be good if we can spend
some time find out why dedup didn't catch them.

I am okay with this mechanism.
