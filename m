how KVM x86 (currently) operates as a sub-subsystem, and to soapbox on
the rules and expectations for contributing to KVM x86.

+KVM x86
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+Foreword
+--------
+KVM strives to be a welcoming community; contributions from newcomers are
+valued and encouraged.  Please do not be discouraged or intimidated by the
+length of this document and the many rules/guidelines it contains.  Everyo=
ne
+makes mistakes, and everyone was a newbie at some point.  So long as you m=
ake
+an honest effort to follow KVM x86's guidelines, are receptive to feedback=
,
+and learn from any mistakes you make, you will be welcomed with open arms,=
 not
+torches and pitchforks.
+
+TL;DR
+-----
+Testing is mandatory.  Be consistent with established styles and patterns.
+
+Trees
+-----
+KVM x86 is currently in a transition period from being part of the main KV=
M
+tree, to being "just another KVM arch".  As such, KVM x86 is split across =
the
+main KVM tree, ``git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm.git``, and a KVM x86
+specific tree, ``github.com/kvm-x86/linux.git``.
+
+Generally speaking, fixes for the current cycle are applied directly to th=
e
+main KVM tree, while all development for the next cycle is routed through =
the
+KVM x86 tree.  In the unlikely event that a fix for the current cycle is r=
outed
+through the KVM x86 tree, it will be applied to the ``fixes`` branch befor=
e
+making its way to the main KVM tree.
+
+Note, this transition period is expected to last quite some time, i.e. wil=
l be
+the status quo for the foreseeable future.
+
+Branches
+~~~~~~~~
+The KVM x86 tree is organized into multiple topic branches.  The purpose o=
f
+using finer-grained topic branches is to make it easier to keep tabs on an=
 area
+of development, and to limit the collateral damage of human errors and/or =
buggy
+commits, e.g. dropping the HEAD commit of a topic branch has no impact on =
other
+in-flight commits' SHA1 hashes, and having to reject a pull request due to=
 bugs
+delays only that topic branch.
+
+All topic branches, except for ``next`` and ``fixes``, are rolled into ``n=
ext``
+via a Cthulu merge on an as-needed basis, i.e. when a topic branch is upda=
ted.
+As a result, force pushes to ``next`` are common.
+
+Lifecycle
+~~~~~~~~~
+Fixes that target the current release, a.k.a. mainline, are typically appl=
ied
+directly to the main KVM tree, i.e. do not route through the KVM x86 tree.
+
+Changes that target the next release are routed through the KVM x86 tree. =
 Pull
+requests (from KVM x86 to main KVM) are sent for each KVM x86 topic branch=
,
+typically the week before Linus' opening of the merge window, e.g. the wee=
k
+following rc7 for "normal" releases.  If all goes well, the topic branches=
 are
+rolled into the main KVM pull request sent during Linus' merge window.
+
+The KVM x86 tree doesn't have its own official merge window, but there's a=
 soft
+close around rc5 for new features, and a soft close around rc6 for fixes (=
for
+the next release; see above for fixes that target the current release).
+
+Timeline
+~~~~~~~~
+Submissions are typically reviewed and applied in FIFO order, with some wi=
ggle
+room for the size of a series, patches that are "cache hot", etc.  Fixes,
+especially for the current release and or stable trees, get to jump the qu=
eue.
+Patches that will be taken through a non-KVM tree (most often through the =
tip
+tree) and/or have other acks/reviews also jump the queue to some extent.
+
+Note, the vast majority of review is done between rc1 and rc6, give or tak=
e.
+The period between rc6 and the next rc1 is used to catch up on other tasks=
,
+i.e. radio silence during this period isn't unusual.
+
+Pings to get a status update are welcome, but keep in mind the timing of t=
he
+current release cycle and have realistic expectations.  If you are pinging=
 for
+acceptance, i.e. not just for feedback or an update, please do everything =
you
+can, within reason, to ensure that your patches are ready to be merged!  P=
ings
+on series that break the build or fail tests lead to unhappy maintainers!
+
+Development
+-----------
+
+Base Tree/Branch
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Fixes that target the current release, a.k.a. mainline, should be based on
+``git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm.git master``.  Note, fixes do =
not
+automatically warrant inclusion in the current release.  There is no singu=
lar
+rule, but typically only fixes for bugs that are urgent, critical, and/or =
were
+introduced in the current release should target the current release.
+
+Everything else should be based on ``kvm-x86/next``, i.e. there is no need=
 to
+select a specific topic branch as the base.  If there are conflicts and/or
+dependencies across topic branches, it is the maintainer's job to sort the=
m
+out.
+
+As a general guideline, use ``kvm-x86/next`` even if a patch/series touche=
s
+multiple architectures, i.e. isn't strictly scoped to x86.  Using any of t=
he
+branches from the main KVM tree is usually a less good option as they like=
ly
+won't have many, if any, changes for the next release, i.e. using the main=
 KVM
+tree as a base is more likely to yield conflicts.  And if there are non-tr=
ivial
+conflicts with multiple architectures, coordination between maintainers wi=
ll be
+required no matter what base is used.  Note, this is far from a hard rule,=
 i.e.
+use a different base for multi-arch series if that makes the most sense.
+
+Coding Style
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+When it comes to style, naming, patterns, etc., consistency is the number =
one
+priority in KVM x86.  If all else fails, match what already exists.
+
+With a few caveats listed below, follow the tip tree maintainers' preferre=
d
+:ref:`maintainer-tip-coding-style`, as patches/series often touch both KVM=
 and
+non-KVM x86 files, i.e. draw the attention of KVM *and* tip tree maintaine=
rs.
+
+Using reverse fir tree for variable declarations isn't strictly required,
+though it is still preferred.
+
+Except for a handful of special snowflakes, do not use kernel-doc comments=
 for
+functions.  The vast majority of "public" KVM functions aren't truly publi=
c as
+they are intended only for KVM-internal consumption (there are plans to
+privatize KVM's headers and exports to enforce this).
+
+Comments
+~~~~~~~~
+Write comments using imperative mood and avoid pronouns.  Use comments to
+provide a high level overview of the code, and/or to explain why the code =
does
+what it does.  Do not reiterate what the code literally does; let the code
+speak for itself.  If the code itself is inscrutable, comments will not he=
lp.
+
+SDM and APM References
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Much of KVM's code base is directly tied to architectural behavior defined=
 in
+Intel's Software Development Manual (SDM) and AMD's Architecture Programme=
r=E2=80=99s
+Manual (APM).  Use of "Intel's SDM" and "AMD's APM", or even just "SDM" or
+"APM", without additional context is a-ok.
+
+Do not reference specific sections, tables, figures, etc. by number, espec=
ially
+not in comments.  Instead, if necessary (see below), copy-paste the releva=
nt
+snippet and reference sections/tables/figures by name.  The layouts of the=
 SDM
+and APM are constantly changing, and so the numbers/labels aren't stable.
+
+Generally speaking, do not explicitly reference or copy-paste from the SDM=
 or
+APM in comments.  With few exceptions, KVM *must* honor architectural beha=
vior,
+therefore it's implied that KVM behavior is emulating SDM and/or APM behav=
ior.
+Note, referencing the SDM/APM in changelogs to justify the change and prov=
ide
+context is perfectly ok and encouraged.
+
+Shortlog
+~~~~~~~~
+The preferred prefix format is ``KVM: <topic>:``, where ``<topic>`` is one=
 of::
+
+  - x86
+  - x86/mmu
+  - x86/pmu
+  - x86/xen
+  - selftests
+  - SVM
+  - nSVM
+  - VMX
+  - nVMX
+
+**DO NOT use x86/kvm!**  ``x86/kvm`` is used exclusively for Linux-as-a-KV=
M-guest
+changes, i.e. for arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c.  Do not use file names or complet=
e file
+paths as the subject/shortlog prefix.
+
+Note, these don't align with the topics branches (the topic branches care =
much
+more about code conflicts).
+
+All names are case sensitive!  ``KVM: x86:`` is good, ``kvm: vmx:`` is not=
.
+
+Capitalize the first word of the condensed patch description, but omit end=
ing
+punctionation.  E.g.::
+
+    KVM: x86: Fix a null pointer dereference in function_xyz()
+
+not::
+
+    kvm: x86: fix a null pointer dereference in function_xyz.
+
+If a patch touches multiple topics, traverse up the conceptual tree to fin=
d the
+first common parent (which is often simply ``x86``).  When in doubt,
+``git log path/to/file`` should provide a reasonable hint.
+
+New topics do occasionally pop up, but please start an on-list discussion =
if
+you want to propose introducing a new topic, i.e. don't go rogue.
+
+See :ref:`the_canonical_patch_format` for more information, with one amend=
ment:
+do not treat the 70-75 character limit as an absolute, hard limit.  Instea=
d,
+use 75 characters as a firm-but-not-hard limit, and use 80 characters as a=
 hard
+limit.  I.e. let the shortlog run a few characters over the standard limit=
 if
+you have good reason to do so.
+
+Changelog
+~~~~~~~~~
+Most importantly, write changelogs using imperative mood and avoid pronoun=
s.
+
+See :ref:`describe_changes` for more information, with one amendment: lead=
 with
+a short blurb on the actual changes, and then follow up with the context a=
nd
+background.  Note!  This order directly conflicts with the tip tree's pref=
erred
+approach!  Please follow the tip tree's preferred style when sending patch=
es
+that primarily target arch/x86 code that is _NOT_ KVM code.
+
+Stating what a patch does before diving into details is preferred by KVM x=
86
+for several reasons.  First and foremost, what code is actually being chan=
ged
+is arguably the most important information, and so that info should be eas=
y to
+find. Changelogs that bury the "what's actually changing" in a one-liner a=
fter
+3+ paragraphs of background make it very hard to find that information.
+
+For initial review, one could argue the "what's broken" is more important,=
 but
+for skimming logs and git archaeology, the gory details matter less and le=
ss.
+E.g. when doing a series of "git blame", the details of each change along =
the
+way are useless, the details only matter for the culprit.  Providing the "=
what
+changed" makes it easy to quickly determine whether or not a commit might =
be of
+interest.
+
+Another benefit of stating "what's changing" first is that it's almost alw=
ays
+possible to state "what's changing" in a single sentence.  Conversely, all=
 but
+the most simple bugs require multiple sentences or paragraphs to fully des=
cribe
+the problem.  If both the "what's changing" and "what's the bug" are super
+short then the order doesn't matter.  But if one is shorter (almost always=
 the
+"what's changing), then covering the shorter one first is advantageous bec=
ause
+it's less of an inconvenience for readers/reviewers that have a strict ord=
ering
+preference.  E.g. having to skip one sentence to get to the context is les=
s
+painful than having to skip three paragraphs to get to "what's changing".
+
+Fixes
+~~~~~
+If a change fixes a KVM/kernel bug, add a Fixes: tag even if the change do=
esn't
+need to be backported to stable kernels, and even if the change fixes a bu=
g in
+an older release.
+
+Conversely, if a fix does need to be backported, explicitly tag the patch =
with
+"Cc: stable@vger.kernel" (though the email itself doesn't need to Cc: stab=
le);
+KVM x86 opts out of backporting Fixes: by default.  Some auto-selected pat=
ches
+do get backported, but require explicit maintainer approval (search MANUAL=
SEL).
+
+Function References
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+When a function is mentioned in a comment, changelog, or shortlog (or anyw=
here
+for that matter), use the format ``function_name()``.  The parentheses pro=
vide
+context and disambiguate the reference.
+
+Testing
+-------
+At a bare minimum, *all* patches in a series must build cleanly for KVM_IN=
TEL=3Dm
+KVM_AMD=3Dm, and KVM_WERROR=3Dy.  Building every possible combination of K=
configs
+isn't feasible, but the more the merrier.  KVM_SMM, KVM_XEN, PROVE_LOCKING=
, and
+X86_64 are particularly interesting knobs to turn.
+
+Running KVM selftests and KVM-unit-tests is also mandatory (and stating th=
e
+obvious, the tests need to pass).  The only exception is for changes that =
have
+negligible probability of affecting runtime behavior, e.g. patches that on=
ly
+modify comments.  When possible and relevant, testing on both Intel and AM=
D is
+strongly preferred.  Booting an actual VM is encouraged, but not mandatory=
.
+
+For changes that touch KVM's shadow paging code, running with TDP (EPT/NPT=
)
+disabled is mandatory.  For changes that affect common KVM MMU code, runni=
ng
+with TDP disabled is strongly encouraged.  For all other changes, if the c=
ode
+being modified depends on and/or interacts with a module param, testing wi=
th
+the relevant settings is mandatory.
+
+Note, KVM selftests and KVM-unit-tests do have known failures.  If you sus=
pect
+a failure is not due to your changes, verify that the *exact same* failure
+occurs with and without your changes.
+
+Changes that touch reStructured Text documentation, i.e. .rst files, must =
build
+htmldocs cleanly, i.e. with no new warnings or errors.
+
+If you can't fully test a change, e.g. due to lack of hardware, clearly st=
ate
+what level of testing you were able to do, e.g. in the cover letter.
+
+New Features
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+With one exception, new features *must* come with test coverage.  KVM spec=
ific
+tests aren't strictly required, e.g. if coverage is provided by running a
+sufficiently enabled guest VM, or by running a related kernel selftest in =
a VM,
+but dedicated KVM tests are preferred in all cases.  Negative testcases in
+particular are mandatory for enabling of new hardware features as error an=
d
+exception flows are rarely exercised simply by running a VM.
+
+The only exception to this rule is if KVM is simply advertising support fo=
r a
+feature via KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID, i.e. for instructions/features that K=
VM
+can't prevent a guest from using and for which there is no true enabling.
+
+Note, "new features" does not just mean "new hardware features"!  New feat=
ures
+that can't be well validated using existing KVM selftests and/or KVM-unit-=
tests
+must come with tests.
+
+Posting new feature development without tests to get early feedback is mor=
e
+than welcome, but such submissions should be tagged RFC, and the cover let=
ter
+should clearly state what type of feedback is requested/expected.  Do not =
abuse
+the RFC process; RFCs will typically not receive in-depth review.
+
+Bug Fixes
+~~~~~~~~~
+Except for "obvious" found-by-inspection bugs, fixes must be accompanied b=
y a
+reproducer for the bug being fixed.  In many cases the reproducer is impli=
cit,
+e.g. for build errors and test failures, but it should still be clear to
+readers what is broken and how to verify the fix.  Some leeway is given fo=
r
+bugs that are found via non-public workloads/tests, but providing regressi=
on
+tests for such bugs is strongly preferred.
+
+In general, regression tests are preferred for any bug that is not trivial=
 to
+hit.  E.g. even if the bug was originally found by a fuzzer such as syzkal=
ler,
+a targeted regression test may be warranted if the bug requires hitting a
+one-in-a-million type race condition.
+
+Note, KVM bugs are rarely urgent *and* non-trivial to reproduce.  Ask your=
self
+if a bug is really truly the end of the world before posting a fix without=
 a
+reproducer.
+
+Posting
+-------
+
+Links
+~~~~~
+Do not explicitly reference bug reports, prior versions of a patch/series,=
 etc.
+via ``In-Reply-To:`` headers.  Using ``In-Reply-To:`` becomes an unholy me=
ss
+for large series and/or when the version count gets high, and ``In-Reply-T=
o:``
+is useless for anyone that doesn't have the original message, e.g. if some=
one
+wasn't Cc'd on the bug report or if the list of recipients changes between
+versions.
+
+To link to a bug report, previous version, or anything of interest, use lo=
re
+links.  For referencing previous version(s), generally speaking do not inc=
lude
+a Link: in the changelog as there is no need to record the history in git,=
 i.e.
+put the link in the cover letter or in the section git ignores.  Do provid=
e a
+formal Link: for bug reports and/or discussions that led to the patch.  Th=
e
+context of why a change was made is highly valuable for future readers.
+
+Git Base
+~~~~~~~~
+If you are using git version 2.9.0 or later (Googlers, this is all of you!=
),
+use ``git format-patch`` with the ``--base`` flag to automatically include=
 the
+base tree information in the generated patches.
+
+Note, ``--base=3Dauto`` works as expected if and only if a branch's upstre=
am is
+set to the base topic branch, e.g. it will do the wrong thing if your upst=
ream
+is set to your personal repository for backup purposes.  An alternative "a=
uto"
+solution is to derive the names of your development branches based on thei=
r
+KVM x86 topic, and feed that into ``--base``.  E.g. ``x86/pmu/my_branch_na=
me``,
+and then write a small wrapper to extract ``pmu`` from the current branch =
name
+to yield ``--base=3Dx/pmu``, where ``x`` is whatever name your repository =
uses to
+track the KVM x86 remote.
+
+Co-Posting Tests
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+KVM selftests that are associated with KVM changes, e.g. regression tests =
for
+bug fixes, should be posted along with the KVM changes as a single series.=
  The
+standard kernel rules for bisection apply, i.e. KVM changes that result in=
 test
+failures should be ordered after the selftests updates, and vice versa, ne=
w
+tests that fail due to KVM bugs should be ordered after the KVM fixes.
+
+KVM-unit-tests should *always* be posted separately.  Tools, e.g. b4 am, d=
on't
+know that KVM-unit-tests is a separate repository and get confused when pa=
tches
+in a series apply on different trees.  To tie KVM-unit-tests patches back =
to
+KVM patches, first post the KVM changes and then provide a lore Link: to t=
he
+KVM patch/series in the KVM-unit-tests patch(es).
+
+Notifications
+-------------
+When a patch/series is officially accepted, a notification email will be s=
ent
+in reply to the original posting (cover letter for multi-patch series).  T=
he
+notification will include the tree and topic branch, along with the SHA1s =
of
+the commits of applied patches.
+
+If a subset of patches is applied, this will be clearly stated in the
+notification.  Unless stated otherwise, it's implied that any patches in t=
he
+series that were not accepted need more work and should be submitted in a =
new
+version.
+
+If for some reason a patch is dropped after officially being accepted, a r=
eply
+will be sent to the notification email explaining why the patch was droppe=
d, as
+well as the next steps.
+
+SHA1 Stability
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+SHA1s are not 100% guaranteed to be stable until they land in Linus' tree!=
  A
+SHA1 is *usually* stable once a notification has been sent, but things hap=
pen.
+In most cases, an update to the notification email be provided if an appli=
ed
+patch's SHA1 changes.  However, in some scenarios, e.g. if all KVM x86 bra=
nches
+need to be rebased, individual notifications will not be given.
+
+Vulnerabilities
+---------------
+Bugs that can be exploited by the guest to attack the host (kernel or
+userspace), or that can be exploited by a nested VM to *its* host (L2 atta=
cking
+L1), are of particular interest to KVM.  Please follow the protocol for
+:ref:`securitybugs` if you suspect a bug can lead to an escape, data leak,=
 etc.
