But that's controlled by userspace, correct?

Strictly speaking, no.  E.g. if a 2MiB region is covered with multiple memslots
and the memslots have different properties.

I agree that practically speaking this will hold true, but if KVMGT wants to honor
KVM's memslots then checking that KVM allows a hugepage is correct.  Hrm, but on
the flip side, KVMGT ignores read-only memslot flags, so KVMGT is already ignoring
pieces of KVM's memslots.

I have no objection to KVMGT defining its ABI such that KVMGT is allowed to create
2MiB so long as (a) the GFN is contiguous according to VFIO, and (b) that the entire
2MiB range is exposed to the guest.

That said, being fully permissive also seems wasteful, e.g. KVM would need to
explicitly support straddling multiple memslots.

As a middle ground, what about tweaking kvm_page_track_is_valid_gfn() to take a
range, and then checking that the range is contained in a single memslot?

E.g. something like:

bool kvm_page_track_is_contiguous_gfn_range(struct kvm *kvm, gfn_t gfn,
					    unsigned long nr_pages)
{
	struct kvm_memory_slot *memslot;
	bool ret;
	int idx;

	idx = srcu_read_lock(&kvm->srcu);
	memslot = gfn_to_memslot(kvm, gfn);
	ret = kvm_is_visible_memslot(memslot) &&
	      gfn + nr_pages <= memslot->base_gfn + memslot->npages;
	srcu_read_unlock(&kvm->srcu, idx);

	return ret;
}

I highly doubt it, I can't imagine an IOMMU would have a dedicated instruction
TLB :-)
