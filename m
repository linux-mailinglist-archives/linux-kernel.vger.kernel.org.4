I sure read thru that thread, and many more :-) to get context.
The highlight is we should something because AVX/AMX do so (or failed to 
do so).
But on the flip side ARM SVE is not disabling this by default.
Your other concerns seems to be potential power implications for leaving 
it on and sharing of V unit across harts (see more on that below)
Maybe leaving it on all the time will be motivation for hw designers to 
be more considerate of the idle power draw.

I mentioned "typical". And below also said that memory allocation 
concerns are moot, since fork/execve failures due to failing to allocate 
would take care of those anyways.

For specialized cases sure we would expect fat binaries with IFUNC based 
dispatches (glibc mem*/str* are obvious examples). But with newer 
compilers autovec is increasing becoming default even at medium 
optimization levels such as -O2. So V code littered all over is just a 
matter of time for the profiles/variants which allow V. For less capable 
systems w/o V this is all but moot discussion since kernel itself need 
not be built with V enabled.

But in this specific example won't the prctl cause more pain. So 2 
concurrent processes on 2 different harts with shared V unit. One sends 
prctl to enable and other wants to disable, what would the kernel do. 
Will it just be whoever ends up running later wins. Granted I'm not too 
familiar with how such a cross-hart sharing would work in a Vector 
instructions being part of ISAÂ  (vs. Vector accelerator with job 
push/pull approach)

Honestly I'm sympathetic to your power concerns with keeping V enabled 
all the time. But the mechanics of implementing this prctl makes me 
wary. Assuming this is done from dynamic loader, it implies loader 
itself needs to be built with V disabled. This also leaves bunch of perf 
on table since loader does tons of of string and memory operations which 
could potentially benefit from V enabled code, granted it is not deal 
breaker.

Very true, but this in itself is not sufficient of a reason to warrant 
adding it now.

Right, but then why did ARM SVE guys chose to not take this path.
