Finally was able to run it on that ThinkSystem SR950 with 8 populated
sockets -> 224 cores and 448 logical CPUs.

The KASAN vmap issues on that system were already no longer reproducible with your
(Luis) previous work that's already in master.

I tested a !debug and debug config (both based on corresponding RHEL9 configs), comparing
929ed21dfdb6 ("master") with 929ed21dfdb6 + Linus' patches ("patched").


Unfortunately, boot times vary a lot, and I did not figure out how to reduce
the noise. I captured the "systemd-analyze blame" output as well.


1) !debug config (not enabling KASAN)

a) master

Startup finished in 32.225s (kernel) + 7.399s (initrd) + 20.378s (userspace) = 1min 3ms
multi-user.target reached after 20.352s in userspace.
Startup finished in 43.734s (kernel) + 7.288s (initrd) + 19.827s (userspace) = 1min 10.851s
multi-user.target reached after 19.800s in userspace.
Startup finished in 50.514s (kernel) + 7.171s (initrd) + 24.757s (userspace) = 1min 22.443s
multi-user.target reached after 24.734s in userspace.
Startup finished in 26.722s (kernel) + 7.249s (initrd) + 23.923s (userspace) = 57.895s
multi-user.target reached after 23.892s in userspace.

b) patched

Startup finished in 36.318s (kernel) + 7.177s (initrd) + 21.383s (userspace) = 1min 4.879s
multi-user.target reached after 21.355s in userspace.
Startup finished in 36.318s (kernel) + 7.177s (initrd) + 21.383s (userspace) = 1min 4.879s
multi-user.target reached after 21.355s in userspace.
Startup finished in 1min 34.678s (kernel) + 7.239s (initrd) + 24.066s (userspace) = 2min 5.985s
multi-user.target reached after 24.040s in userspace.
Startup finished in 25.879s (kernel) + 7.144s (initrd) + 29.665s (userspace) = 1min 2.689s
multi-user.target reached after 29.637s in userspace.



2) debug config (enabling KASAN)

a) master

Startup finished in 2min 12.695s (kernel) + 25.058s (initrd) + 1min 13.012s (userspace) = 3min 50.765s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 12.903s in userspace.
Startup finished in 1min 45.400s (kernel) + 24.294s (initrd) + 1min 8.910s (userspace) = 3min 18.606s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 8.786s in userspace.
Startup finished in 2min 4.857s (kernel) + 24.715s (initrd) + 1min 5.088s (userspace) = 3min 34.660s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 4.967s in userspace.
Startup finished in 3min 20.400s (kernel) + 24.703s (initrd) + 1min 5.469s (userspace) = 4min 50.573s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 5.344s in userspace.

b) patched

Startup finished in 2min 5.250s (kernel) + 25.049s (initrd) + 1min 1.961s (userspace) = 3min 32.262s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 1.844s in userspace.
Startup finished in 1min 52.524s (kernel) + 24.897s (initrd) + 1min 5.062s (userspace) = 3min 22.484s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 4.916s in userspace.
Startup finished in 9min 36.817s (kernel) + 24.859s (initrd) + 1min 18.657s (userspace) = 11min 20.335s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 18.455s in userspace.
Startup finished in 30min 20.715s (kernel) + 24.722s (initrd) + 1min 7.039s (userspace) = 31min 52.476s
multi-user.target reached after 1min 6.907s in userspace.


What concerns me a bit, is that on the patched kernel we seem to hit more cases where
boot takes much longer (in both kernel configs).

I'll do some more runs/investigation to see if this is reproducible or just some system oddity.

Staring just at the udev settle time (systemd-analyze blame), it's very similar between both kernel
versions.
