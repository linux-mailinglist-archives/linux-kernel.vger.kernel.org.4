Argument that it doesn't work?  I thought that ship sailed a long time
ago but I could be wrong as I don't really pay attention to that stuff
as it's just vaporware :)

Then work with those groups to implement that in an industry-wide way
and then take advantage of it by adding support for it to Linux!  Don't
try to reinvent the same thing in a totally different way please.

Then create a new bus for that if you don't trust the virtio bus today.

Everyone wants a subset, different from other's subset, which means you
need them all.  Sorry.

Great, then work with the PCI group as talked about above to solve it
properly and not do whack-a-mole like seems to be happening so far.

Great, work with the PCI spec for verified devices.

Great, work with the PCI spec people please.

Then combine it with device attestation and you have a solved solution,
don't ignore others working on this please.

Where is the "man" here in the middle of?

And any PCI attestation should handle that, if not, work with them to
solve that please.

Thunderbolt has authenticated device support today, and so does PCI, and
USB has had it for a decade or so.  Use the in-kernel implementation
that we already have or again, show us where it is lacking and we will
be glad to take patches to cover the holes (as we did last year when
ChromeOS implemented support for it in their userspace.)

You tell me, as we trust ACPI tables today, and if we can not, again
then you need to change the model of what Linux does.  Why isn't the
BIOS authentication path working properly for ACPI tables already today?
I thought that was a long-solved problem with UEFI (if not, I'm sure the
UEFI people would be interested.)

Anyway, I'll wait until I see real patches as this thread seems to be
totally vague and ignores our current best-practices for pluggable
devices for some odd reason.
