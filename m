Hi Madhavan,

At a high-level, I think this still falls afoul of our desire to not reverse
engineer control flow from the binary, and so I do not think this is the right
approach. I've expanded a bit on that below.

I do think it would be nice to have *some* of the objtool changes, as I do
think we will want to use objtool for some things in future (e.g. some
build-time binary patching such as table sorting).

Just as a note: there are a few issues remaining (e.g. the kretprobe and fgraph
PC recovery both have windows where they lose the original return address), and
there are a few compiler-generated trampoline functions with non-AAPCS calling
conventions that will need special care.

There's a more fundamental issue here in that objtool has to reverse-engineer
control flow, and so even if the kernel code and compiled code generation is
*perfect*, it's possible that objtool won't recognise the structure of the
generated code, and won't be able to reverse-engineer the correct control flow.

We've seen issues where objtool didn't understand jump tables, so support for
that got disabled on x86. A key objection from the arm64 side is that we don't
want to disable compile code generation strategies like this. Further, as
compiles evolve, their code generation strategies will change, and it's likely
there will be other cases that crop up. This is inherently fragile.

The key objections from the arm64 side is that we don't want to
reverse-engineer details from the binary, as this is complex, fragile, and
unstable. This is why we've previously suggested that we should work with
compiler folk to get what we need.

I'll note that at the last Linux Plumbers Conference, there was a discussion
about what is now called SFrame, which *might* give us sufficient information,
but I have not had the time to dig into that as I have been chasing other
problems and trying to get other infrastructure in place.

This still requires reverse-engineering the forward-edge control flow in order
to compute those offets, so the same objections apply with this approach. I do
not think this is the right approach.

I would *strongly* prefer that we work with compiler folk to get the
information that we need.

Have you reported this to the GCC folk, and can you give any examples?
I'm sure they would be interested in fixing this, regardless of whether we end
up using it.

Thanks,
Mark.
