Probably, yes. But I dislike the fact that this would imply that we know
about the details how kvm_init_mmu() and, moreover, init_kvm_tdp_mmu()
are implemented and I'd rather like to avoid that to not introduce bugs
or regressions via future code changes in either one of them. By calling
out to kvm_init_mmu() we avoid that implicitly as a future change, for
sure, must check all callers and would find this location. If we instead
simply extract the (as of now) required bits, that might go unnoticed.

That said, I agree that there's still room for improvements.

I'll look into what can be done about it. But this change is a first
step that can be further optimized via follow up changes.

As you can see from the numbers below, it's already way faster that what
we have right now, so I'd rather land this (imperfect) change sooner
than later and gradually improve on it. This will, however, likely only
bring minor speedups compared to this change, so they're less important,
IMHO.

The question is really what's better from a maintenance point of view:
Keeping the call to the commonly used kvm_init_mmu() function or special
case even further? I fear the latter might regress easier, but YMMV, of
course.
