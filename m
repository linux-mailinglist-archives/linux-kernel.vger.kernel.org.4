IIUC, at least we need bellow change in the kernel,

@@ -3705,9 +3705,6 @@ static int bpf_obj_get_next_id(const union bpf_attr *=
attr,
        if (CHECK_ATTR(BPF_OBJ_GET_NEXT_ID) || next_id >=3D INT_MAX)
                return -EINVAL;

        if (!idr_get_next(idr, &next_id))

Because the container doesn't have CAP_SYS_ADMIN enabled, while they
only have CAP_BPF and other required CAPs.

Another possible solution is that we run an agent in the host, and the
user in the container who wants to get the bpf objects info in his
container should send a request to this agent via unix domain socket.
That is what we are doing now in our production environment.  That
said, each container has to run a client to get the bpf object fd.
There are some downsides,
-  It can't handle pinned bpf programs
   For pinned programs, the user can get them from the pinned files
directly, so he can use bpftool in his case, only with some
complaints.
-  If the user attached the bpf prog, and then removed the pinned
file, but didn't detach it.
   That happened. But this error case can't be handled.
- There may be other corner cases that it can't fit.

There's a solution to improve it, but we also need to change the
kernel. That is, we can use the wasted space btf->name.
