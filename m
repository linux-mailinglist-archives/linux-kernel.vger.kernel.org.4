Thanks! I do not really think we need to rush node based reclaim and
better have a reasonable and more futureproof interface.

Yes, I believe, I have addressed all the feedback but I am open to alter
the wording of course. The biggest concern by Mina IIRC was that the
nr_reclaimed reporting has been a pre-existing problem. And I agree with
that. The thing is that this doesn't matter without node specification
because the memory gets reclaimed even if the reported value is over
accounted. With nodemask specification the value becomes bogus if no
demotion nodes are specified because no memory gets reclaimed
potentially while the success is still reported. Mina has tried to
address that but I am not convinced the fix is actually future proof.

This really requires more discussion.
