I'm really concerned about the user experience here.  I assume users
do not want to edit the DT based on what device they plug in.  They
shouldn't need to (and probably won't) know whether the device
supports L1SS.

I hate kernel/module parameters, but I think even that would be better
then having to edit the DT.

There's obviously a period of time when L1SS is supported but not yet
enabled, so I'm *guessing* the "OS has been configured to activate
L1SS" is not actually a requirement, and choosing (c) really just
opens the possibility that L1SS can be used?

Would be nice to have a hint (maybe a line or two of the panic
message) to help users find the fix for a problem they're seeing.

Obviously the ideal would be if we could use (c) in all cases, so I
assume that's where a panic might happen.  What situation would that
be?  An endpoint that doesn't support L1SS?  One that supports L1SS
but it's not enabled?  Maybe if L1SS isn't configured correctly, e.g.,
LTR values programmed wrong?
