Hi Michal!

Thank you for taking a look.
Do you have any numbers to share?

In general, I agree that it's a micro-optimization, but:
1) some people periodically complain that accounted allocations are slow
   in comparison to non-accounted and slower than they were with page-based
   accounting,
2) I don't see any particular hot point or obviously non-optimal place on the
   allocation path.

so if we want to make it faster, we have to micro-optimize it here and there,
no other way. It's basically the question how many cache lines we touch.

Btw, I'm working on a patch 3 for this series, which in early tests brings
additional ~25% improvement in my benchmark, hopefully will post it soon as
a part of v1.

Thanks!
