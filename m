I have skimmed through the series, and dug more deeply into portions of
the patches, but have not yet fully examined the full series.

I will be on vacation for a week or so, and will resume the detailed
reading of the series.

One overall comment at this point, is that this series is somewhat
duplicating portions of the (incomplete and fragile) overlay functionality
but not fully.  One trivial example is no locking to prevent interference
between tree modification by overlay code that could be occurring
asynchronously at the same time this new code is modifying the tree.
