I like this table and I wouldn't want for it to go under in some commit
message which is not that easy to retrieve so I'm thinking you should
add it along with some blurb to

  Documentation/x86/amd-memory-encryption.rst

instead where it belongs.

Yah, get rid of that PPR formulation. If you see the verb "may" always
run away. :-)

Yah, that makes sense - you want to protect those for future use. Ack.

Simpler and shorter.

And there's no way we won't notice that we've forgotten to do so because
it'll terminate with the proper error code.

SNP_FEATURES_PRESENT

And so I've done a couple of changes ontop, here's a diff as it explains
a lot better what I mean.

Have a look and let me know if something's wrong.

Thx.
