Sorry to interrupt, this email is reformat as plaint text, I want to

whether can send linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org .


Hi Bjorn,

I think my patch is different from Lucas, because I use 
pcie_wait_for_link not

pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus, my patch is similar to the process logic

in pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus which also call pcie_wait_for_link.


pcie_wait_for_link wait fixed 100ms and then wait the data link is 
ready, but

pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus call pcie_wait_for_link wait time depends

on the devices max waiting time in bus, the calculate max time having a bug

as below,


In pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus, pci_bus_max_d3cold_delay will take 
count of wrong time delay,

such as NVIDIA GPU T4 is not pci bridge, so the subordinate is none, 
pci_bus_max_d3cold_delay

set the min_delay is 100, max_delay is 0, here is the bug, after 
list_for_each_entry() in pci_bus_max_d3cold_delay,

the min_delay will be 0, the max_delay also 0, the 
pci_bus_max_d3cold_delay return is surely 0.


Last, I request Ravi Kishore Koppuravuri to test my patch to see Intel 
Ponte Vecchio HPC GPU

whether can work, I think my patch will wait enough time to be ready 
after secondary bus reset.


I have tested NVIDIA GPU T4 and NVIDIA GPU A100 which my patch is ok, 
but I think there is need

more test to validate my patch. But the fact is I do not have enough 
device to validate. If Ravi Kishore Koppuravuri

can help me test, the patch test will be more enough, and I would be 
grateful for test. Thank you very much!
