While unfortunate, it is a bit of the nature of the problem KASLR is 
attempting to address. If you know in advance where kernel pages are 
going to live and the frames that will be used for DMA, then have you 
not defeated the purpose of the randomization? As for the firmware use 
of the IOMMU, I am fairly certain those tables will get invalidated by 
the ACM when it is setting up the PMRs.

Yes, you would get a different measurement for the commandline. If you 
are thinking in terms of attestation, I would expect that the 
attestation measurement db would have a record for an acceptable 
commandline and would determine the system to be in an unknown state if 
it did not match.

While the idea could be explored to create measurements based on 
configurations of kernel subsystems, this would likely entail 
instrumentation in those subsystems to assert a measurement to their 
configuration. Maybe IMA could cover something like this? It would 
definitely enable the ability to make deeper assessments about the state 
of a system, but I think this is out of the scope of what Secure Launch 
is attempting to do.
