pcibios_default_alignment is in effective for all the pci devices and bridges, in function
pci_reassigndev_resource_alignment if it is set with alignment limit, it will disable memory
access and force to reassign memory resource for the device even if it is already aligned . It
will bring some negative effect such as pci VGA device for GOP use.

pcibios_align_resource is relative safer and it will reassigned resource for specified bar. I am
not familiar with pci, pci experts will give the best answer.

Another way, I checkout source code of uefi bios,  it seems that memory resource is aligned
with fixed 4K size.  There is such code:
https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Bus/Pci/PciBusDxe/PciEnumeratorSupport.c
        if (PciIoDevice->PciBar[BarIndex].Length < (SIZE_4KB)) {
          //
          // Force minimum 4KByte alignment for Virtualization technology for Directed I/O
          //
          PciIoDevice->PciBar[BarIndex].Alignment = (SIZE_4KB - 1);
        } else {
          PciIoDevice->PciBar[BarIndex].Alignment = PciIoDevice->PciBar[BarIndex].Length - 1;
        }
