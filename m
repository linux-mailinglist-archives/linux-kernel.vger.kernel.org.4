Output:
	drm.stat (with consumed time(s))

Input:
	drm.throttle (alternatives)
	- a) writing 0,1 (in rough analogy to your proposed
	     notifications)
	- b) writing duration (in loose analogy to memory.reclaim)
	     - for how long GPU work should be backed off

An userspace agent sitting between these two and it'd do the measurement
and calculation depending on given policies (weighting, throttling) and
apply respective controls.

I'd also like show comparison with CPU accounting and controller.
There is tick-based (~sampling) measurement of various components of CPU
time (task_group_account_field()). But the actual schedulling (weights)
or throttling is based on precise accounting (update_curr()).

So, if the goal is to have precise and guaranteed limits, it shouldn't
(cannot) be based on sampling. OTOH, if it must be sampling based due to
variability of the device landscape, it could be advisory mechanism with
the userspace component.

Michal
