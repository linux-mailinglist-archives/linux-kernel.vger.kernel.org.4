There will be no difference between them after this commit is applied
from the DW eDMA core driver point of view. CONFIG_DW_EDMA_PCIE now
depends on the CONFIG_DW_EDMA config state (see it's surrounded by
if/endif in the Kconfig file). Without this patch the
CONFIG_DW_EDMA_PCIE config determines the CONFIG_DW_EDMA config state
by forcibly selecting the one. Using the similar approach for the
CONFIG_PCIE_DW driver I found less attractive because it would have
effectively converted the CONFIG_DW_EDMA config tristate to boolean.

That's why instead I decided to convert the CONFIG_DW_EDMA config to
being independent from any other config value. (See the table in the
my previous email message.)

Even if CONFIG_DW_EDMA (not CONFIG_DW_EDMA_PCIE) is set to m or n I
would have still recommended to call dw_pcie_edma_detect() because the
method performs the DW eDMA engine auto-detection independently from the DW
eDMA driver availability. As a result the system log will have a
number of eDMA detected channels if the engine was really found. It's
up to the system administrator to make sure that the eDMA driver is
properly built/loaded then for the engine to be actually available in
the kernel/system.

"Convert the DW eDMA kconfig to being independently selected by the
user in order to preserve the module build options flexibility and fix
the "undefined reference to" error on DW PCIe driver build."
