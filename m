 Do you mean this part:

?  Well, I inferred, perhaps incorrectly, from the second paragraph that 
Peter agrees with my approach (with the CSPRNG being what `get_random_u8' 
and friends get at).

 Sorry about that.  I put the change heading for the previous iterations 
in the change log, but I agree actual web links would've been better:
<https://lore.kernel.org/all/alpine.DEB.2.21.2301081919550.65308@angie.orcam.me.uk/>,
<https://lore.kernel.org/all/alpine.DEB.2.21.2301082113350.65308@angie.orcam.me.uk/>.

 Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thank you for your review.

  Maciej
