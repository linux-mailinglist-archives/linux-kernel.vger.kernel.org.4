I completely agree that "guarded" lacks precision, but as above, I've pretty much
given up hope of being super precise.  I actually like "restricted", I just don't
like that I can't shorten the name.

Hmm, maybe that won't be a huge problem in practice.  I can't say I've ever heard
any use "rmem" in verbale or written communication, it's primarily just "rmem" in
code that we can't use, and I don't mind having to use restrictedmem for the namespace.
So maybe we can use "rmem", just not in code?

Or, we could pretend we're pirates and call it arrrmem!, which is definitely going
to be how I refer to it in my internal dialogue if we keep "restricted" :-)

Oof, and guarded storage is even documented in Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst.

Hidden/Concealed/etc - Too close to secretmem, suffers the "hidden from whom" problem,
and depending on the use case, the memory may not actually be concealed from the
user that controls the VMM.

Restricted - "rmem" collides with "reserved memory" in code.

Guarded - Conflicts with s390's "guarded storage", has the "from whom" problem.

Inaccessible - Many of the same problems as "hidden".

Unmappable - Doesn't cover things like read/write, and is wrong in the sense that
the memory is still mappable, just not via mmap().

Secured - I'm not getting anywhere near this one :-)
