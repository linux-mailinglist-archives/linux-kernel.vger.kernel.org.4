Yes, but thining of it, very soon people in various security-sensitive
distributions will disable it, as they should indeed. And people who
need to use their Braille device on such distributions will get stuck.

Can we perhaps just introduce a CAP_TIOCSTI that the brltty daemon would
be able to use? We could even make it only allow TIOCSTI on the linux
console (tty->ops == con_ops).

FreeBSD provides poor support for that, people have to use a patched
screen tool to somehow access the console (but only after login).
