PCI_EXP_SLTSTA, PCI_EXP_LNKSTA, etc are typically RW1C and do not need
the usual RMW locking (which I think is what you were saying).

Sounds like you have a pretty strong opinion, Lukas, but I guess I
don't really understand the value of having locked and unlocked
variants of RMW accessors.  Config accesses are relatively slow and I
don't think they're used in performance-sensitive paths.  I would
expect the lock to be uncontended and cheap relative to the config
access itself, but I have no actual numbers to back up my speculation.
Is the performance win worth the extra complexity in callers?
