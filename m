The requirement is sane, but the issue is user experience: User trying 
to bring up some V code has no clue that deep in some startup code some 
alt stack had been setup and causing his process to be terminated on 
first V code.

Good. Lets have this in v14 as it seems reasonably easy to implement.

Please lets not cross threads. We discussed this already at top. While 
ideally required, seems tricky so lets start with post-V alt stack check.

I concur that the alt stack checking requirements are sensible in the 
long run. We can add the obvious check for post-V case and see if there 
is a sane way to flag pre-V case to.

Indeed we've come a long way, lets push the gear so we can use the 
coming cycle to flesh out any changes for a possible 6.4 inclusion.

Thx,
