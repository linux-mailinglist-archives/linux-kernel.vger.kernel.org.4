Thanks a lot for sending this series. I've raised this problem in various
venues in the past, but it seems it is hard to do something better than what
you propose here.

Borrowing some behaviours from PREEMPT_RT (like threadedirqs) won't cut it
outside PREEMPT_RT AFAIU.

Peter did suggest an alternative at one point in the past to be more aggressive
in limiting softirqs [1] but I never managed to find the time to verify it
- especially its impact on network throughput as this seems to be the tricky
trade-of (and tricky thing to verify for me at least). I'm not sure if BLOCK
softirqs are as sensitive.

I think the proposed approach is not intrusive and offers a good balance that
is well contained and easy to improve upon on the future. It's protected with
a configuration option so users that don't want it can easily disable it.
