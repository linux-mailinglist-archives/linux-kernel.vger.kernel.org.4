Correct this device can not presently use the simple macros.

This is a generic issue with devices that use PM runtime, but
also have IRQs. The system suspend process re-enables IRQs before it
re-enables the PM runtime. This means if your IRQ handler uses PM
runtime and you get an IRQ in that window things don't work. The
simplest solution is to disable IRQs across the window. Ideally
one day this would probably get fixed in the PM core, but that is
likely a massively non-trivial amount of work.

To be clear the code allows IRQs whilst in system suspend (aka wakes)
and whilst resumed. As the IRQ output of the chip is level based, the
temporary disable only causes a slight delay in handling the IRQ.

I am not sure there are significant issues supporting the
!CONFIG_PM case, you need a couple __maybe_unused's. What issues
are you expecting here? Yeah ok you get worse power consumption
in that case, but you did turn off power management, presumably
you were not that concerned about power consumption.

Again remember the system vs runtime suspend here. Holding a
system wake lock will have no effect on the runtime PM.

The power savings from not blocking suspend are tiny, at least
outwith the !CONFIG_PM case. The driver is only blocking hibernate
when it is actively talking to the device, during which time the
device will very likely not be hibernating anyway.

I think really it is up to Fred and Ben who are supporting the
driver. If they feel the device will work reliably that way,
I certainly won't stand in the way. But I would be keen to avoid
a situation where all the downstream implementations (ie. most
of the testing) use PM runtime and the upstream code is full of
corner cases that haven't been ironed out, so I would like to
know they are going to be moving our customers over to this new
mode of operation if they decide to switch to it. Certainly you
are not wrong that it would save a fair amount of code from the
driver and make it look a lot cleaner.

Thanks,
Charles
