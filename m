Looking at the log you just sent (thanks), it appears you are using
distro shim+grub, which implement their own rough approximation of PE
file loading, and typically use the EFI handover protocol. This is
good news, because we already know how broken shim and GRUB are, and I
was concerned that there might be another issue to track down here.

I'll implement Evgeny's suggestion to clear BSS explicitly in the EFI
handover protocol entrypoints for the next revision of the series.

Thanks,
