Considering this issue as one specific to memory error handling, checking
HPG_vmemmap_optimized in __get_huge_page_for_hwpoison() might be helpful to
detect the race.  Then, an idea like the below diff (not tested) can make
try_memory_failure_hugetlb() retry (with retaking hugetlb_lock) to wait
for complete the allocation of vmemmap pages.

@@ -1938,8 +1938,11 @@ int __get_huge_page_for_hwpoison(unsigned long pfn, int flags,
        int ret = 2;    /* fallback to normal page handling */
        bool count_increased = false;

-       if (!folio_test_hugetlb(folio))
+       if (!folio_test_hugetlb(folio)) {
+               if (folio_test_hugetlb_vmemmap_optimized(folio))
+                       ret = -EBUSY;
                goto out;
+       }

        if (flags & MF_COUNT_INCREASED) {
                ret = 1;
