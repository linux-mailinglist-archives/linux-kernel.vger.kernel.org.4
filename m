Are those numbers coming from /proc/<pid>/stat?  Something else?

Good question.  I'm not exactly a perf expert and almost never do anything beyond
`perf top`.  That's probably sufficient for now, I really just want to confirm that
L1 doesn't appear to be stuck, e.g. in KVM's page fault handler.

Nice.  I have Intel hardware at home that I'll try to repro on, though it will
be several weeks until I can dive into this.

I don't particularly love the idea of disabling the TDP MMU without having the
slightest clue what's going wrong, but I'm not totally opposed to it.

Paolo, any thoughts?  You have far more experience with supporting downstream
consumers of KVM.

By default, yes.  I double checked that L2 has similar boot times for KVM-on-KVM
with and without the TDP MMU.  Certainly nothing remotely close to 2 minutes.
