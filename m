 From the spec it says "control methods must assume
all operation regions are inaccessible until the
_REG(RegionSpace, 1) method is executed"

It also points out the opposite: "Conversely,
control methods must not access fields in
operation regions when _REG method execution
has not indicated that the operation region
handler is ready."

The ACPI spec doesn't refer to D3 in this context, but
it does make an allusion to power off in an example case.

"Also, when the host controller or bridge controller
is turned off or disabled, PCI Config Space Operation
Regions for child devices are no longer available.
As such, ETH0’s _REG method will be run when it is
turned off and will again be run when PCI1 is
turned off."

 From my discussions with BIOS developers, this is entirely
intended behavior based on the _REG section in the spec.

Right; I'm with you on not putting it with a suspend
transition.

The spec indicates that control methods can't access
the regions until _REG is called, so
my leaning is to keep the call at init time, and
then add another call for the D3 and D0 transitions
which is why I think pci_set_power_state() is probably
best.
