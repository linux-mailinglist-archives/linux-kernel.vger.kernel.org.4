No, I mean that the virtual CPU model (CPUID + VMX MSRs) that is presented to the
guest is the responsibility of host userspace.  KVM only cares about not enabling
bits/features that KVM doesn't supported.

vmx->nested.msrs.  vmcs_config->nested is effectively the VMX equivalent of
KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID.

Ugh, that path got overlooked when we yanked out KVM's manipulaton of VMX MSRs
in response to guest CPUID changes.  I wonder if we can get away with changing
KVM's behavior to only ensure a feature isn't exposed to L2 when it's not exposed
to L1.

Assuming KVM actually supports user wait/pause in L2, this is an orthogonal bug
to the CPUID-based manipulation above.  KVM simply neglects to advertise to userspace
that ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE is supported for nested virtualization.

If KVM doesn't correctly support virtualizing user wait/pause for L2, then the
correct location to fix this is in vmx_secondary_exec_control().

Ah, you're right, I didn't realize KVM enables VMFUNC in L1.  Enabling VMFUNC for
L1 is silly though, it's trivial to clear the feature in vmx_secondary_exec_control().

That said, enabling VMFUNC in vmcs01 is an orthogonal topic, and it _is_ indeed
easier to keep the feature in the reference config.  Now that the nested config
is derived from the non-nested config, nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs() can do:
