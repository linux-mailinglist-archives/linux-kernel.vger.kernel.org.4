So, with these (helpful) stats, the improvement is obvious (and explains the ~1s
improvement I saw staring at the startup times of the udev services).

There are still some failed module loads with the debug config (only in the
becoming state), I did not dive deeply into the actual code changes (-EBUSY),
just spelling it out so we can decide if this is to be expected or some corner
case that shouldn't be happening.


Thanks!
