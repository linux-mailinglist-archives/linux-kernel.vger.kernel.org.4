Our test case is just to perform DMA to/from the host on one device on
a switch and what we are seeing is that when we hit an IOVA that
matches up with the physical address of the neighboring devices BAR0
then we are seeing an AER followed by a hot reset.

This assumes all parts are doing the Request Redirect "correctly". In
our case there is a PCIe switch we are trying to debug and we have a
few working theories. One concern I have is that the switch may be
throwing an ACS violation for us using an address that matches a
neighboring device instead of redirecting it to the upstream port. If
we pull the switch and just run on the root complex the issue seems to
be resolved so I started poking into the code which led me to the
documentation pointing out what is supposed to be reserved based on
the root complex and MSI regions.

As a part of going down that rabbit hole I realized that the
reserved_regions seems to only list the MSI reservation. However after
digging a bit deeper it seems like there is code to reserve the memory
behind the root complex in the IOVA but it doesn't look like that is
visible anywhere and is the piece I am currently trying to sort out.
What I am working on is trying to figure out if the system that is
failing is actually reserving that memory region in the IOVA, or if
that is somehow not happening in our test setup.
