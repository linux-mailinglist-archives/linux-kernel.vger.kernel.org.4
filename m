Well, it is possible that some of these systems will be affected.

One of such cases is when the port in question has _S0W which says
that wakeup from D3 is not supported.  In that case I think the kernel
should honor the _S0W input, because there may be a good reason known
to the platform integrator for it.

The other case is when wakeup.flags.valid is unset for the port's ACPI
companion which means that the port cannot signal wakeup through
ACPI-related means at all and this may be problematic, especially in
the system-wide suspend case in which the wakeup capability is not too
relevant unless there is a system wakeup device under the port.

I don't think that the adev->wakeup.flags.valid check has any bearing
on the _S0W check - if there is _S0W and it says "no wakeup from D3",
it should still be taken into account - so that check can be moved
past the _S0W check.

Now, for compatibility with systems where ports have neither _S0W nor
the HotPlugSupportInD3 property, the acpi_pci_power_manageable()
return value should determine the outcome regardless of the
adev->wakeup.flags.valid value, so the latter should only determine
whether or not the HotPlugSupportInD3 property will be inspected
(which may cause true to be returned before the "power manageable"
check).

IOW, something like this (after checking _S0W):

if (adev->wakeup.flags.valid &&
    !acpi_dev_get_property(adev, "HotPlugSupportInD3",
ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER, &obj) &&
    obj->integer.value == 1)
        return true;

return acpi_pci_power_manageable(dev);

Where the if () condition basically means that wakeup signaling is
supported (and there is no indication that it cannot be done from D3
as per the previous _S0W check) and hotplug signaling from D3 is
supported.
