Yes.  The granularity of interceptions varies based on the architectural re=
vision,
and presumably there are things that always trap.  But the core concept of =
letting
software decide what to intercept is the same.

Redirecting readers to specs for gory details is fine.  Redirecting for bas=
ic,
simple functionality is not.  Maybe the swap types will someday be common k=
nowledge
in KVM, and an explanation will no longer be necessary, but we are nowhere =

that point.

It's not really an English thing.  "Vectoring" is, or at least was, Intel t=
erminology
for describing the flow from the initial detection of an exception to the e=
xception's
delivery to software, e.g. covers the IDT lookup, any GDT/LDT lookups, push=
ing
information on the stack, fetching the software exception handler, etc.  Im=
portantly,
it describes the period where there are no instructions retired and thus uc=
ode doesn't
open event windows, i.e. where triggering another, non-contributory excepti=
on will
effectively "hang" the CPU (at least on CPUs without Intel's "notify" VM-Ex=
it support).

Well, _injecting_ the #DB is necessary for correctness from the guest's per=
spective.
"What's the point of _intercepting_ #DB" is the real question.  And for SEV=
-ES guests
with DebugSwap, there is no point, which is why I agree that KVM should dis=
able
interception in that case.  What I'm calling out is that disabling #Db inte=
rception
isn't _necessary_ for correctness (unless I'm missing something), which mea=
ns that
it can and should go in a separate patch.

But that's irrelevant.  Intercepting DR7 writes will break the guest regard=
less
of how the guest deals with the #VC.  If the guest eats the #VC and continu=
es on,
the debug capabilities expected by the guest will still be missing, i.e. KV=
M has
broken the functionality of the guest.  I am total ok if the changelog desc=
ribes
the _possible_ scenarios (within reason), e.g. that the guest will either p=
anic
on an unexpected #VC or lose debug capabilities that were promised.  What I=
'm
objecting to is speculating on what the guest is _likely_ to do, and especi=
ally
using that speculation as justification for doing something in KVM.

I am asking you to include it in your series because the comment I suggeste=
d above
(for DebugSwap) loosely depends on the revamped comment for sev_es_prepare_=
switch_to_guest()
as a whole.  I would like to settle on the exact wording for all of the com=
ments
in sev_es_prepare_switch_to_guest() in a single series instead of having di=
sjoint
threads.
