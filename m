I see it now.

(Joerg, maybe we should add F:drivers/virt/coco/ to the MAINTAINERS list
so that patches there are hopefully sent to linux-coco?)

Introducing a new constant sounds good to me (and use the same constant
in the guest driver).

I think 4 pages are OK; I also don't see real harm in increasing this
limit to 1 MB (if the host+guest agree to pass more stuff there, besides
certificates).  But maybe that's just abusing this channel, and for
other data we should use other mechanisms (like vsock).
