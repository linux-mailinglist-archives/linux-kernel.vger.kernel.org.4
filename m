In my tests, I took the exact code generated by klp-ccp, and adapted it to not
rely on kallsyms anymore, removing the symbol lookups. For data symbols, I
changed it to be a extern variable instead of a pointer to it. For the function
symbols, also removed the pointer lookup, and left only the function prototype,
and it worked as expected.

I was quite surprised that it worked quite well. But I agree with
Nicolai that the tool itself could be shrunk into a smaller version. In our
usage, klp-ccp knows all unexported functions and to which modules they belong,
as it's currently used for the symbol lookup. I believe that kpatch-build also
has similar information so all the symbols.klp and other Kbuild machinery could be
avoided, making the tool responsible to only generate the klp relocations based
on the undefined symbols, just as proposed by Nicolai.
