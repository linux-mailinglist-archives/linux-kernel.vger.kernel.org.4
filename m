It took me a while to grasp the above, but I think you mean determining
extensions based on mvendor etc, right?

yeah, this one was more following a train of thought. Thinking about the
issues, this was more of an addon thought, as I wasn't really sure which
way to go.

So you're right, vendor isa-extensions should also come from the ISA
string from firmware, similar to the base extensions. Not based on the
mvendor-id and friends.

I guess I'm still seeing Zbb and friends - with just computational
instructions as always good to have. But I guess you're right that the
hypervisor should be able to control itself which extensions.

The thead-vector (0.7.1) would probably fit this description. Though in
that case, userspace definitly needs to know about it, to use it :-) .

But of course this should only be forwarded when relevant support
is available in the kernel.

And then reality happens ;-)

I guess I'll poke this some more in the meantime, taking into account
all the comments from above :-) .
