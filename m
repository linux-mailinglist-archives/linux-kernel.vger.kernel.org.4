How about adding a boolean flag by comparing user input for module
parameter msi_remap? and add the flag at

    - if (!(features & VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP) || msi_flag
        || offset[0] || offset[1])

Correct if I am wrong, but in this way we can cover all the cases.
If user adds msi_remap=on, msi_flag=true and enables remapping.
If user adds msi_remap=off, msi_flag=false and disables remapping.
If user doesn't add anything, msi_flag=false and decision will be
made same as current implementation. This will cover guest OS case
as well.
