I know. My motivation was the following:

1. Kconfig is not C. My view is that it is more like a menu. There is a
   top level item. If the top level is enabled then there is a submenu
   with a more detailed selection of various variants and options.

2. The current logic is quite complicated from my POV. And it was
   even before your patchset. For example,
   HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_BUDDY is defined as:

	config HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_BUDDY
		bool
		depends on SMP
		default y

   One would expect that it would be enabled on SMP system.
   But the final value depends on many other variables
   which are defined using relatively complex conditions,
   especially HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR, HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_NON_ARCH,
   and HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_NON_ARCH.

   Understanding the logic is even more complicated because Kconfig is
   not indexed by cscope.

Important: The logic used at the end of the patchset actually
   follows the C style. It defines how the various variables
   depend on each other from top to bottom.

>

This one is actually defined in the menu-like order:

	config SOFTLOCKUP_DETECTOR

	config BOOTPARAM_SOFTLOCKUP_PANIC
		depends on SOFTLOCKUP_DETECTOR

It is because the custom option depends on the top level one.
This is exactly what I would like to achieve with HARDLOCKUP
variables in this patchset.

Petr
