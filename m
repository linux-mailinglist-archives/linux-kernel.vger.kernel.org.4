Ahh, yeah, that's why I missed it. Good that it made it, will set up lei
to not miss such pulls in the future.

Yeah, funny story, I seem to share the name with someone that joined the
discussion yesterday, as he also ran into a problem with that stuff. He
even uses my own private domain for his email address, too. I bet that's
the guy with strange hair that often looks me in the eye first thing in
the morning when I see this silver thingy on the wall. I'll have a word
with him to ensure he from now on will add his regressions to the
tracking himself. ;)

Ciao, Thorsten 'the regression tracker who forgets to add regressions to
 the tracking that plague himself' Leemhuis
