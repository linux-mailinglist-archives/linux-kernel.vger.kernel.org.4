Right, but I think we'd better to create a simpler scheduler (just for
two events) in the PT driver, since you have two co-existing PT events
now, one is from the host and the other is from the guest. I don't think
it's KVM's responsibility to schedule events.

So I think the process should be something as below.

- Let KVM create a PT event if the guest request one.
- In VM-entry, just invoke the perf_event_enable_local(guest).
  The PT driver should schedule out the host event or whatever events
and schedule in the guest event.
- In VM-exit, just invoke the perf_event_disable_local(guest).
  The PT driver should schedule in the host event or whatever events and
schedule out the guest event.

I still don't think we want to expose the host event.

Thanks,
Kan
