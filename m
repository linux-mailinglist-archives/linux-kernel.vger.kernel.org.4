It seemed to me as I should have so to make sure we are on the page of

How am I supposed to know? You should have asked him at the time of
his patches review before accepting them. He (Punnaiah Choudary
Kalluri) said they had the system with two different DDR controllers.
Since the MC idx was supposed to be provided by the controller driver
he suggested to have both devices support implemented in the same
driver. You agreed. If no interaction intended between the two devices
why did he need to combine their support in the same driver then? He
could have as well just split the drivers up and didn't bother with
all the discussions.

I don't. The Synopsys EDAC driver author (Punnaiah) did judging by
what he said in your discussion.

Once again. What is driver-depended do you have in the EDAC core?
Does it follow the bus-device-drivers model? I failed to find any
inter-driver dependency (what could be seen for instance in the
tty/serial subsystem). But I am not the subsystem maintainer after all.
I found the possible races in the MC index registration and fixed it
in the corresponding patch. But that was the just
registration-specifics behavior which could be easily fixed in the
same way as the most of the kernel subsystem do.

You are worried about the concurrencies. Does the EDAC core have
problems if there are several DDR devices of the same type probed?
AFAICS it doesn't as long as the indexes are properly allocated by the
driver. What is the problem with registering devices of different
types? The error counters are the MC-data-specific, so are the
sysfs-nodes. The EDAC MC error handler function doesn't touch any
inter-device parts of the core. The registration procedure is
protected by the mutex and RCU. So it seems as the EDAC core developer
thought about having the devices being registered concurrently.

If it has never needed to, then please explain why did you let the
Synopsys EDAC driver being accepted like that then?

In my case it's a single EDAC driver per-chip. There can be several
DDR-controllers installed on the same SoC, but all of them of the same
type (Synopsys DW uMCTL2 v2.61a).

I don't have a system with different DDR controllers detected on the
same SoC but Punnaiah Choudary Kalluri, original Synopsys EDAC driver
developer, did.

The main part of the letter starts exactly with the goals and then has
text with more details of what is done and why. It is enough to get a
notion regarding the patchset aim and content. Each patchlog starts
with the problem description, the suggested solution and some details
of the implementation I thought was required to add. Everything in
accordance with the kernel patches standards.
