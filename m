Hi Sean/Ackerley,

Thanks for doing that. Overall making gmem a KVM ioctl() looks good to
me and it should also play nice with Intel TDX. Besides what Ackerley
mentioned below, I think we haven't discussed device assignment, which
will be supported in not too long distance. Current VFIO_IOMMU_MAP_DMA
consumes virtual address so that needs to be fixed for fd-based memory
anyway, and the fix looks not related to whether this being a syscall()
or a KVM ioctl(). There will be some initialization sequence dependency,
e.g. if gmem is finally a VM-scope ioctl() then we need VM created first
before can we map fd-based memory in VFIO, but that sounds not an issue
at all.

I also see Vlastimil/David expressed their preference on ioctl. So maybe
we can move forward on your current PoC. Do you already have a plan to
post a formal version?
