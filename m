Thanks for the clarifications :)

Would you mind linking to where this is documented & explaining in your
commit message why it is okay operate on the basis of s*aia in the ISA
string only mandates the presence of the CSRs and nothing more.

I think when I was reading it last night, I saw some commentary in this
vein in Section 1.6 of the rc2 spec. Although IIRC it noted changes in
interrupt behaviour there too, so I'm not sure if that section is what you
are referring to here.

Perhaps this is all just a good argument for providing more information
in commit messages ;)

Cool, thanks.
By what mechanism, since you say that "s*aia" in the ISA string only
implies presence of the CSRs [sic], are we meant to discover the
presence of Chapter 9?
A property of the IOMMU node seems the most logical I suppose, or
perhaps inferred from the presence/config of other properties of said
node?

Thanks again Anup,
