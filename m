This has got nothing to do with breaking integrity.

Then any fault injection can break integrity? This is another can of
worms waiting to be opened here. It's not productive and doesn't help.
Let's focus on a better / flexible MAC policy here.

You might want to reconsider your threat model about allowing partial
unprivileged access to eBPF, even if it's partial access. What you are
eventually going to run into is side channel attacks (please look at
the recent side channel issues exploited with unprivileged eBPF and
you don't need "offensive helpers" for these).

It's not difficult. The core primitive is that the container manager
generates a unique ID per process and sets it on the task blob / local
storage (this can be flexible on what a definition of a container is
in your runtime [i.e a mix and match of different namespace ids)].
This can then be passed on the subprocesses via LSM hooks

BPF LSM is the worst case, but all LSMs have overhead.  I hear you and
here's my series to address this overhead.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20230120000818.1324170-3-kpsingh@kernel.org/T/#t
and, as of now, between them they have most of the patches.

This has got nothing to do with kernel integrity. Please don't try to
shoe-horn your policy requirements into integrity.

If you really want to go with your threat model and allow partially
available unprivileged BPF, this should be done via BPF LSM. The
kernel should not try to adjust its definition of integrity based on a
rather questionable threat model. Let's fix the LSM overhead and
unblock flexibility for your use-case.
