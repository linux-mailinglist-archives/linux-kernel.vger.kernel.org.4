yeah I get it.

Yeah, I am fine with either a new sysfs entry to return the cached value,
or a new sysfs entry to change the behavior of the existing /temp, as I
mentioned before, either way works for me, if changing the existing one
is too intrusive.

I2C was just the factual example I had, but you are right, the use case
is not isolated to I2C sensor. Rather, to be clear I am not blaming I2C,
the actual issue just happen to be easier to see when I2C devices, slower
than typical MMIO devices, are being used as input for the control.

That is right, the balance between supporting user space reads and
running the control timely is the actual original concern. The problem
fades out a bit when you have device reads in the us / ns time scale
and control update is in 100s of ms. But becomes more apparent on slower
devices, when reads are in ms and policy update is in the 100s ms, that is
why the I2C case was quoted. But nothing wrong with I2C, or supporting
I2C on the thermal subsystem as we do today via the hwmon interface REGISTER_TZ,
the problem is on having to support the control in kernel and a read in
userspace that can create jitter to the control.

And as you properly stated, for this use case, the userspace does not care
about the most recent value of the device, so that is why the change
proposes to give cached values.

On the flip side though, there may be user space based policies that
require the most recent device value. But in this case, the expectation
is to disable the in kernel policy and switch the thermal zone to
mode == disabled. And that is also why this patch will go the path
to request the most recent device value when the /temp sysfs entry
is read and the mode is disabled.

I would suggest to have an addition sysfs entry that sets the
thermal zone into cached mode or not, let's say for the sake of the
discussion, we call it 'cached_values', with default to 'not cached'.
This way, we could support:

a) Default, current situation, where all reads in /temp are always backed up
with an actual device .get_temp(). Nothing changes here, keeps reading
under /temp, and so long system designer is satisfied with jittering,
no need to change anything.

b) When one has control in kernel, and frequent userspace reads on /temp
but system designer wants to protect the control in kernel to avoid jittering.
Just keep reading from /temp but set the new sysfs property 'cached_values' to 'cached'.
Then userspace will get updated values as frequent as the kernel control has
and the kernel control will not be disturbed by frequent device reads.

c) When one has control in userspace, and wants to have the most frequent
device read. Here, one can simply disable the in kernel control by
setting the 'mode' sysfs entry to 'disabled', and making sure the new sysfs property is set
to 'not cached'. Well in fact, the way I thought this originally in this patch
was to simply always read the device when /temp is read is 'mode' is 'disabled'.

I believe you proposed to have another sysfs entry  sysfs entry for reading cached temperature.
Something like 'temp_cached'. Thinking of it, as I mentioned before, it will work.
The only possible downside is to have two entries to read temperature.

Strong opinions on any of the above?
