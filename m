Right, that sounds good.

This was regarding the conditional for the memcpy(). In the current
patch, it's not copying anything from tmpbuf into the output buffer
if the i2c_transfer() call fails, because maybe there is some
sensitive information in tmpbuf from a previous allocation. But
it's not strictly necessary for correctness, as drm_dp_dual_mode_read()
would return nonzero in this case and the output buffer is ignored
at all current call sites. This was along the lines of "what if later
on, someone adds a sysfs interface that calls drm_dp_dual_mode_read()
and returns the data without checking the return value". Or maybe just
make it a kzalloc instead? I'm probably overthinking this.

So, a rough prototype:

	char *tmpbuf = NULL;
	struct i2c_msg msgs[] = {
		{
			.addr = DP_DUAL_MODE_SLAVE_ADDRESS,
			.flags = 0,
			.len = 1,
			.buf = &zero,
		},
		{
			.addr = DP_DUAL_MODE_SLAVE_ADDRESS,
			.flags = I2C_M_RD,
			.len = size + offset,
			.buf = buffer,
		},
	};

	if (offset) {
		tmpbuf = kzalloc(size + offset, GFP_KERNEL);
		if (!tmpbuf)
			return -ENOMEM;
		msgs[1].buf = tmpbuf;
	}

	ret = i2c_transfer(adapter, msgs, ARRAY_SIZE(msgs));
	if (tmpbuf)
		memcpy(buffer, tmpbuf + offset, size);
	kfree(tmpbuf);

	if (ret < 0)
		return ret;
	if (ret != ARRAY_SIZE(msgs))
		return -EPROTO;
	return 0;
