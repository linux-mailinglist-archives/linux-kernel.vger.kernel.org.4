Hello,

I am writing to you on behalf of Mr. Yusuf Habib. My name is Lukas, I am 
an investment portfolio Manager at MetLife, and my client (Mr. Yusuf 
Habib) has a large sum of money he is looking for someone to help him 
manage the funds. The Saudi government filed charges against my-client 
Mr. Yusuf Habib with the aim of keeping him in prison indefinitely.

  A variety of local and foreign politicians, civil activists, and 
journalists consider the process leading to the imprisonment of Mr. 
Yusuf to be politically motivated. My client's involvement and financial 
support for Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi posed the most challenge ever to 
Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud who happens to be the current Crown Prince 
of Saudi Arabia the money is currently deposited in the name of an 
existing Investment entity.

My client Mr. Yusuf Habib has presented a subtle offer that will need 
the help of a partner like you to complete successfully. Mr. Yusuf Habib 
is in a difficult situation, and he must immediately relocate certain 
sums of money and this must be done in such a way that it must not be 
tied to Mr. Yusuf Habib. The money is currently deposited in the name of 
an existing Investment entity. Your role will be to:

[1]. Act as the original beneficiary of the funds.
[2]. Receive the funds into a business / private bank account.
[3]. Invest / Manage the funds outside of Turkey
[4]. Value of funds: 35 million US Dollars.


Everything will be done legally to ensure the rights to the funds are 
transferred to you. If you agree to partner with Mr. Yusuf Habib in this 
partnership business proposal, he will compensate you with 35% percent 
of the total sum. Terms will be discussed when you show interest and if 
you aren't interested and you know of someone looking for an investor, 
please give him / her my contact.

Should you prefer I re-contact you with more express facts. Then make 
your interest known.

Sincerely,
Lukas.
