Hi Bjorn,

How about "Increase delay to 100ms for PERST# deassert from moment 
power-rails achieve operating limits"

REV 5.0 also quote same TPVPERL=100ms delay.
I refer REV. 3.0 as pci-j721e controller follows REV. 3.0

Its for the endpoints, TI's EVB doesn't exhibit any issues with 100us 
delay but some customer reported the issue with shorter delay.
I have been working to refactor this driver to build as a module, I too
observed the issue on re-probe after remove when delay is lesser.

Sure, will do it in next revision but should this go in some generic PCI 
header file or just pci-j721e.c
