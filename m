I'm not sure if we are talking past each other here. I don't really
follow where you see the problem here?

If the hardware works as expected and the job is behaving well, it will
finish in finite time when the HW is done with the job. When the job is
bad and crashes the HW, sure it will be shot down by the timeout
handling. Both cases will signal the fences and clean up resources
eventually.

Keeping the scheduler entity alive is really orthogonal to that. If the
entity is kept alive until the job is cleaned up we could potentially
add more common state, like the GPU time tracking, to the entity
without the risk of use after free.
