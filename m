Well, yes, I'm sure there's lots of issues with hot-unplug and DT.
That's pretty much anything using DT, not just platform devices. Those
will only get fixed when folks try to do that, but so far we've mostly
prevented doing that. For example, we don't support a generic
mechanism to add and remove DT overlays because most drivers aren't
ready for their DT node to disappear.

Is there some restriction that says platform_bus can't do hotplug? I
thought everything is hotpluggable (in theory).

Only because platform_bus is the bus type in the kernel that supports
MMIO devices and that the DT code uses to instantiate them. The DT
code doesn't care if those are at the root level or behind some other
bus type.

Yes, we could add IOMEM resources, DT ID table and matching, etc., but
we'd just end up back at of_platform_bus with a new name. Every driver
doing both would have 2 driver structs and register calls. What do we
gain from that?
