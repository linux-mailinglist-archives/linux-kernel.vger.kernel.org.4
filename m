+
+libbpf is a C-based library containing a BPF loader that takes compiled BPF
+object files and prepares and loads them into the Linux kernel. libbpf tak=
es the
+heavy lifting of loading, verifying, and attaching BPF programs to various
+kernel hooks, allowing BPF application developers to focus only on BPF pro=
gram
+correctness and performance.
+
+The following are the high-level features supported by libbpf:
+
+* Provides high-level and low-level APIs for user space programs to intera=
ct
+  with BPF programs. The low-level APIs wrap all the bpf system call
+  functionality, which is useful when users need more fine-grained control
+  over the interactions between user space and BPF programs.
+* Provides overall support for the BPF object skeleton generated by the bp=
ftool.
+  The skeleton file simplifies the process for the user space programs to =
access
+  global variables and work with BPF programs.
+* Provides BPF-side APIS, including BPF helper definitions, BPF maps suppo=
rt
+  and, tracing helpers, allowing developers to simplify BPF code writing.
+* Supports BPF CO-RE mechanism, enabling BPF developers to write portable
+  BPF programs that can be compiled once and run across different kernel
+  versions.
+
+This document will delve into the above concepts in detail, providing a de=
eper
+understanding of the capabilities and advantages of libbpf and how it can =
help
+you develop BPF applications efficiently.
+
+#################################
+BPF App Lifecycle and libbpf APIs
+#################################
+
+BPF application consists of a set of BPF programs, either cooperating or
+completely independent, and BPF maps and global variables, shared between =
all
+BPF programs (allowing them to cooperate on a common set of data). llibbpf
+provides APIs that user space programs can use to manipulate the BPF progr=
ams by
+triggering different phases of a BPF application lifecycle. The APIs abstr=
act
+away the complexity of BPF programs and provide a more intuitive way to ma=
nage
+the lifecycle of BPF applications. The differents phases and corresponding
+libbpf APIs to trigger are listed below:
+
+* **Open phase** (``bpf_object__open()``). In this phase, libbpf parses th=
e BPF
+  object file and discovers BPF maps, BPF programs, and global variables. =
After
+  a BPF app is opened, user space apps can make additional adjustments
+  (setting BPF program types, if necessary; pre-setting initial values for
+  global variables, etc.) before all the entities are created and loaded.
+
+* **Load phase** (``bpf_object__load()``). In the load phase, libbpf creat=
es BPF
+  maps, resolves various relocations, and verifies and loads BPF programs =
into
+  the kernel. At this point, libbpf validates all the parts of a BPF appli=
cation
+  and loads the BPF program into the kernel, but no BPF program has yet be=
en
+  executed. After the load phase, it=E2=80=99s possible to set up the init=
ial BPF map
+  state without racing with the BPF program code execution.
+
+* **Attachment phase** (``bpf_program__attach()``). In this phase, libbpf
+  attaches BPF programs to various BPF hook points (e.g., tracepoints, kpr=
obes,
+  cgroup hooks, network packet processing pipeline, etc.). This is also the
+  phase at which BPF starts performing useful work and read/update BPF map=
s and
+  global variables.
+
+* **Tear down phase** (``bpf_program__destroy()``). In the tear down phase,
+  libbpf detaches BPF programs and unloads from the kernel. BPF maps are
+  destroyed, and all the resources used by the BPF app are freed.
+
+By leveraging the libbpf APIs, developers write code that can easily inter=
act
+with BPF programs and ensure that they are working effectively and efficie=
ntly.
+
+########################
+BPF Object Skeleton File
+########################
+
+BPF skeleton is an alternative and complementary interface to libbpf APIs =
for
+working with BPF objects. You can generate the skeleton header file
+``(.skel.h)`` for a specific object file by passing the BPF object to the
+bpftool. The generated ``.skel.h`` file simplifies the code to load and wo=
rk
+with the BPF objects, maps, programs, and global data from the user space.=
 For
+example, the generated BPF skeleton has corresponding functions to trigger=
 each
+phase in the BPF life cycle:
+
+* ``<name>__open()`` =E2=80=93 creates and opens BPF application (``<name>=
`` stands for
+  the corresponding bpf object name)
+* ``<name>__load()`` =E2=80=93 instantiates, loads,and verifies BPF applic=
ation parts
+* ``<name>__attach()`` =E2=80=93 attaches all auto-attachable BPF programs=
 (it=E2=80=99s
+  optional, you can have more control by using libbpf APIs directly)
+* ``<name>__destroy()`` =E2=80=93 detaches all BPF programs and
+  frees up all used resources
+
+Keep in mind, BPF skeleton provides access to the underlying BPF object, so
+whatever was possible to do with generic libbpf APIs is still possible eve=
n when
+the BPF skeleton is used. It's an additive convenience feature, no syscall=
s, and
+no cumbersome code.
+
+
+Other Advantages of Using SkeletonFile:
+########################################
+
+* BPF skeleton provides a convenient interface to work with BPF global
+  variables from the user space by memory mapping BPF global variables int=
o the
+  user space as a struct. The struct interface allows user space programs =
to
+  easily set up initial values of variables before the BPF load phase and =
fetch
+  and update data from user space afterward.
+
+* The ``skel.h`` file reflects the object file structure by listing out the
+  available maps, programs, etc. BPF skeleton provides direct access to al=
l the
+  BPF maps and BPF programs as struct fields. This eliminates the need for
+  string-based lookups with ``bpf_object_find_map_by_name()`` and
+  ``bpf_object_find_program_by_name()`` APIs, reducing errors due to BPF s=
ource
+  code and user-space code getting out of sync.
+
+* The generated skeleton file is embedded with a bytecode representation o=
f the
+  object file, ensuring that the skeleton and the BPF object file are alwa=
ys in
+  sync.
+
+###########
+BPF Helpers
+###########
+
+libbpf provides BPF-side APIs that BPF programs can use to interact with t=
he
+system. libbpf conveniently provides definitions of BPF helpers, allowing =
you to
+use them in BPF code as any other plain C function. For example, there are
+helper functions to print debugging messages, get the time since the syste=
m was
+booted, interact with BPF maps, manipulate network packets, etc.
+
+For a complete description of what the helpers do, the arguments they take=
, and
+the return value, see the `bpf-helpers
+<https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html>`_ man page.
+
+#########################################
+BPF CO-RE (Compile Once =E2=80=93 Run Everywhere)
+#########################################
+
+libbpf works with the compiler to support BPF CO-RE mechanism to produce a
+single executable binary that you can run on multiple kernel versions and
+configurations. This approach allows developers to write portable BPF
+applications and run them in any Linux system without modifications and ru=
ntime
+source code compilation on the target machine.
+
+To support CO-RE programs, libbpf relies on the header file, ``vmlinux.h``=
, to
+tailor the BPF program code to a particular running kernel on the host.
+``vmlinux.h`` file includes all kernel types (BTF type) that the running k=
ernel
+uses. Including this header file in your BPF program can eliminate depende=
ncy on
+system-wide kernel headers. You can generate ``vmlinux.h`` using the follo=
wing
+bpftool command:
+
+::
+
+$ bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c > vmlinux.h
+
+
+libbpf looks at the BPF program=E2=80=99s recorded BTF type and relocation=
 information
+and matches them to BTF information provided by the running kernel. libbpf
+resolves and matches all the types and fields, and updates necessary offse=
ts and
+other relocatable data to ensure that BPF program=E2=80=99s logic is corre=
ctly
+functioning for a specific kernel on the host.
+
+##############
+libbpf Vs. BCC
+##############
+
+Historically, `BCC <https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/>`_ was a framework of =
choice
+for developing BPF applications that required efficient kernel tracing for
+analyzing kernel components. BCC compiles BPF programs on the host machine,
+ensuring that the memory layout your BPF program expects is precisely the =
same
+as that of the target host. However, BCC relies on runtime compilation and
+brings the entire huge LLVM/Clang library in and embeds it inside itself. =
This
+results in many consequences, such as heavy resource utilization, kernel h=
eaders
+dependency, and detecting even trivial compilation errors only during run =
time,
+all of which are less than ideal.
+
+libbpf aims at eliminating overheads associated with BPF app development by
+reducing heavy dependency on system-wide headers. libbpf enables you to ge=
nerate
+small binaries that can be compiled once and run anywhere, which is better=
 at
+resource usage and keeps runtime overhead to a minimum. libbpf offers seve=
ral
+benefits by playing the role of a BPF program loader, performing mundane s=
etup
+work (relocations, loading and verifying BPF programs, creating BPF maps,
+attaching to BPF hooks, etc.), and letting developers worry only about BPF
+program correctness and performance. With these features, libbpf makes the
+overall developer experience much more pleasant.
+
+###########################
+Getting Started with libbpf
+###########################
+
+Check out the `libbpf-bootstrap <https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstra=
p>`_
+repository with simple examples of using libbpf to build various BPF
+applications.
+
+Also, find the libbpf API documentation `here
+<https://libbpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_
+
+###############
+libbpf and Rust
+###############
+
+If you are building BPF applications in Rust, it is recommended to use
+`Libbpf-rs <https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-rs>`_  ibrary instead of bind=
gen
+bindings directly to libbpf. Libbpf-rs wraps libbpf functionality in
+Rust-idiomatic interfaces and provides libbpf-cargo plugin to handle BPF c=
ode
+compilation and skeleton generation. Using Libbpf-rs will make building us=
er
+space part of the BPF application easier. However, you are still expected =
to
+write BPF program code in plain C, utilizing all the BPF-side APIs of libb=
pf
+directly.
