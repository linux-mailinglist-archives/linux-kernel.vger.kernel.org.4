This is a final patchset in the series created in the framework of
my Baikal-T1 PCIe/eDMA-related work:

[1: Done v5] PCI: dwc: Various fixes and cleanups
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220624143428.8334-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
Merged: kernel 6.0-rc1
[2: Done v4] PCI: dwc: Add hw version and dma-ranges support
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220624143947.8991-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
Merged: kernel 6.0-rc1
[3: In-review v6] PCI: dwc: Add generic resources and Baikal-T1 support
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20221107204934.32655-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
[4: Done v6] dmaengine: dw-edma: Add RP/EP local DMA support
Link: ---you are looking at it---

Note it is very recommended to merge the patchsets in the same order as
they are listed in the set above in order to have them applied smoothly.
So @Bjorn, @Lorenzo as we agreed let's merge the leftover patchsets
in via your repos.

Here is a short summary regarding this patchset. The series starts with
fixes patches. We discovered that the dw-edma-pcie.c driver incorrectly
initializes the LL/DT base addresses for the platforms with not matching
CPU and PCIe memory spaces. It is fixed by using the pci_bus_address()
method to get a correct base address. After that you can find a series of
the interleaved xfers fixes. It turned out the interleaved transfers
implementation didn't work quite correctly from the very beginning for
instance missing src/dst addresses initialization, etc. In the framework
of the next two patches we suggest to add a new platform-specific
callback - pci_address() and use it to convert the CPU address to the PCIe
space address. It is at least required for the DW eDMA remote End-point
setup on the platforms with not-matching CPU/PCIe address spaces. In case
of the DW eDMA local RP/EP setup the conversion will be done automatically
by the outbound iATU (if no DMA-bypass flag is specified for the
corresponding iATU window). Then we introduce a set of the patches to make
the DebugFS part of the code supporting the multi-eDMA controllers
platforms. It starts with several cleanup patches and is closed joining
the Read/Write channels into a single DMA-device as they originally should
have been. After that you can find the patches with adding the non-atomic
io-64 methods usage, dropping DT-region descriptors allocation, replacing
chip IDs with the device name. In addition to that in order to have the
eDMA embedded into the DW PCIe RP/EP supported we need to bypass the
dma-ranges-based memory ranges mapping since in case of the root port DT
node it's applicable for the peripheral PCIe devices only. Finally at the
series closure we introduce a generic DW eDMA controller support being
available in the DW PCIe Root Port/Endpoint driver.
