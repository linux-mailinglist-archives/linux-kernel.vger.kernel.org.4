Eww.  So you need to carefully filter the BAR and can't actually do
any DMA at all?  I'm not sure that is actually practical, especially
not for something with a lot of state.

So now we need to write a vfio shim for every function even if there
is absolutely nothing special about that function?  Migrating really
is the controlling functions behavior, and writing a new vfio bit
for every controlled thing just does not scale.

Yes, and that's the problem, because they are associated with the
controlled function, and now we have a communication problem between
that vfio driver binding to the controlled function and the drive
that actually controlls live migration that is associated with the
controlling function.  In other words: you've created a giant mess.

I'm not proposing to ignore them.  But they should not be needed most
of the time.

So you've created a long term userspace API around working around
around buggy and/or misdesigned early designs and now want to force
it down everyones throat?

Can we please take a step back and think about how things should work,
and only then think how to work around weirdo devices that do strange
things as a second step?

While creating the VFs from the PF driver makes a lot more sense,
remember that vfio is absolutely not the only use case for VFs.
There are plenty use cases where you want to use them with the normal
kernel driver as well.  So the interface to create VFs needs a now
to decide if it should be vfio exported, or use the normal kernel
binding.

Yes.

For SIOV you have no other choice anyway.  But I agree that it is
the right thing to do for VFIO.  Now the next step is to control
live migration from the controlling function, so that for most sane
devices the controlled device does not need all the pointless
boilerplate of its own vfio driver.

Yes.
