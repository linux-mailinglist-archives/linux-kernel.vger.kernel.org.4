The op takes 8 bits, and enough to cover all normal block layer OPs and
driver specific OPs, so I'd suggest this way, and ublk device
specific OP can be started from 32, prefixed with

	UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN				//[32, 96)
or
	UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_OUT				//[96, 160)

such as, report zones can be defined as

	enum {
		__UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN_START = 32,
		UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN_REPORT_ZONES = __UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN_START,
		__UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN_END = 96,

		__UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_OUT_START = __UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN_END,
		__UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_OUT_END = 160,
	};

For any DRV OPs, iod header(not include ->addr) and buffer format can be re-defined
as uapi structure.

What do you think of this way?

That might be more flexible, but could add driver & userspace's
complexity, so I'd suggest to try to avoid bidirectional buffer asap,
but we still reserve support for it via UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN_OUT*.
