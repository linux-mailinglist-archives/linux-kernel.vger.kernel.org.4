FWIW, I tested this series in an arm64 heterogeneous setup with things
like hotplug and exec()ing between 32-bit and 64-bit tasks and it all
seems good.

The alternative would be to revert Waiman's setaffinity changes, which
I've had a go at here:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/will/linux.git/log/?h=ssa-reverts

and I _think_ I've rescued the UAF fix too.

What do people prefer?
