In the commit log, I think "forcibly selecting the DW eDMA driver from
the DW PCIe RP/EP kconfig" actually refers to just the "DW eDMA PCIe"
driver" not the "DW PCIe RP/EP driver," right?

The undefined reference to dw_edma_probe() doesn't actually happen
unless we merge 27/27 without *this* patch, right?  If so, I wouldn't
call this a "fix" because nobody has ever seen the link failure.

OK.  I think this would be much simpler if it were split into two
patches:

  1) Prepare dw_edma_probe() for builtin callers

     When CONFIG_DW_EDMA=m, dw_edma_probe() is built as a module.
     Previously edma.h declared it as extern, which meant that
     builtin callers like dw_pcie_host_init() and dw_pcie_ep_init()
     caused link errors.

     Make it safe for builtin callers to call dw_edma_probe() by using
     IS_REACHABLE() to define a stub when CONFIG_DW_EDMA=m.

     Builtin callers will fail to detect and register eDMA devices
     when CONFIG_DW_EDMA=m but will otherwise work as before.

  2) Make DW_EDMA_PCIE depend on DW_EDMA

     This seems like a good idea and is much nicer than "select
     DW_EDMA", but I think it should be a separate patch since it
     really only relates to dw-edma-pcie.c.  I would use "depends on
     DW_EDMA" instead of adding if/endif around DW_EDMA_PCIE.

What do you think?  Am I still missing something?
