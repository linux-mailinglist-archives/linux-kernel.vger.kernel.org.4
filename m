We omit the architectures-specific//deliberately in the commit message.

When I create this patch, I'm also wondering whether we should enumerate 
the usage cases.

But as far as I can see it, vgaarb is more about the PCI peripherals.

It's more about the video adapter, firmware framebuffer, etc.

It seems that there is no good reason why this function should be

monopolized by X86 and IA64.


Loongson LoongArch is one of the architectures with EFIFB support, which

could utilize this function to implement something fun.

But it's OK, we could improve the commit message in the next version of 
this patch.

As far as I know, Arm and Arm64 also have EFIFB support.

while this patch is not relevant to firmware (efi, uboot, pmon, etc.).

It is only relevant to the global screen_info.

As long as the firmware passes screen_info to the kernel.

On one of my LoongArch machines with AMDGPU mounted,

The UEFI firmware puts its firmware framebuffer at the amdgpu's vram BAR.

With this patch applied, it works as expected. see below:

The above log is extracted from the dmesg log;

This log can prove that the discrete GPU finally overrides the 
integrated one.

In this case, the discrete GPU will be the default boot device.

This meets normal users' expectations.


But what if we want to use the integrated one as the default boot device 
and have it opened by the X server as the primary GPU by default?

Without opening the computer's machine box, unmount the discrete GPU 
every time.

On a multi-GPU system, this function gives us a chance to mandate which 
card to use by default.

There is no need to invent a complex parameter-passing strategy between 
the firmware and the kernel.

The UEFI firmware could simply place the firmware framebuffer at the 
desired GPU's vram bar.

vgaarb could decode the user's setting by comparing address ranges.

But still, this is more about PCI peripherals and/or firmware framebuffers.

An arch that can't use this machinism should jump in here and explain 
why their arch can't support it. Am I right?

This is also the reason I'm CCing my co-workers who make the Loongson 
UEFI firmware,

There are early-stage UEFI firmwares for Loongson machines released,

which either put the EFIFB in the wrong bar or don't have UEFI GOP 
support at all.

Which causes the kernel space (GPU/DC) device driver to have to pay for it.

no more please. I hope they can do the right thing.

Ok, nice comments.

I'm not native English speaker, sometimes I can't sense the subtle 
differences of similar word.

But I will improve it at next version, please give more tolerance, thanks.

Previously,  make a single patch is for convenient.

OK, I split it into two patch at the next version.
