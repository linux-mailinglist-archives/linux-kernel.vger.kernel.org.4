Can we add extra config option and let architecture selects whether enable it?
Here is piece of code:

#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_MEMRES_PAGE_ALIGN
        /*
         * force minimum page alignment for vfio pci usage
         */
        if (res->flags & IORESOURCE_MEM)
                align = max_t(resource_size_t, PAGE_SIZE, align);
#endif
