It was my proposal to focus on the documentation first in a single
patch.
So we can nail down the scope and details of the user-facing API without
Jorge and the reviewers spending time on polishing internals that will
change anyways.

The code exists and will be submitted with future revisions again.
You can find v6 with the code here:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230309201022.9502-1-jorge.lopez2@hp.com/

I should have also requested a note to that point with this revision.
