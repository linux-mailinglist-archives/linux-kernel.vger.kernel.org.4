No, we don't.

This only means that PCI devices may be power manageable by the
platform and so the platform code should be invoked to check that.
AFAICS, intel_mid_pwr_get_lss_id(() will return an error for a device
without platform PM support.

Amen.

However, even though by the PCIe spec it should be possible to program
PCIe ports without ACPI PM support into D3hot via PMCSR, I'm not
actually sure how that works in practice, especially as far as PCIe
Root Ports are concerned.

Hardware designs usually don't allow Root Ports to be power managed
individually, so I suppose that programming them into D3hot (or D1 or
D2 for that matter) could be treated by the Host Bridge as dropping
references to them or something similar and I can imagine that this
may not work on some platforms and so maybe it should be avoided in
general.

When there is ACPI PM support, though, it can at least be assumed that
the platform designer has taken Root Port D3hot into account.

My understanding is that it is related to the remark above: It is
generally unclear how Root Port power management without ACPI support
is supposed to work, so they are kind of a special case.
