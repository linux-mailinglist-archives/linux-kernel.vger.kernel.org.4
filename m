I agree. The patch is to robust *software* path, but not support 
broken hardware.

I found that spi_sync_locked() will deactivate cs if any failure
is generated inside it.

    spi_sync_locked()
	...
        spi_transfer_one_message()
            ...
            if (ret != 0 || !keep_cs)
                spi_set_cs(msg->spi, false, false);

spi_transfer_one_message() is the default transfer method, I think 
other spi controllers who implements .transfer_one_message should 
have the same behaviour.

Sending an empty message when cs is already deactivated may have a small
side effect: cs will go activate and deactivate in a very short time,
means a pulse will be generated on cs pin. This may also happen when
failure is generated by spi_sync_locked() which called inside ->flow_control().

So to reduce this, I prefer deactivating cs only when phy->flow_control()
fails. If the side effect is totaly acceptable, your advice maybe better.

Waiting for your suggestions.
