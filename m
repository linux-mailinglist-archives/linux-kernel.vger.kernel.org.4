I see below that this laptop has a panel which is mounted 90 degrees
rotated, that likely explains why the ACPI matrix does not work.
So the best thing to do here is to just override it with a hwdb entries.

IIRC there are already 1 or 2 other hwdb entries which actually
override the ACPI provided matrix because of similar issues.

Linux userspace expects the matrix in this case to be set so that
it causes e.g. gnome's auto-rotation to put the image upright
even with older gnome versions / mate / xfce which don't know about
the panel being mounted 90 degrees.

So e.g. "monitor-sensor" will report left-side-up or right-side-up
while the device is actually in normal clamshell mode with the
display up-right.

This reporting of left-side-up or right-side-up is actually "correct"
looking from the native LCD panel orientation and as mentioned is
done for backward compatibility. This is documented here:

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/hwdb.d/60-sensor.hwdb#L54

The way we are handling this is likely incompatible with how Windows
handles this special case of 90Â° rotated screen + ROTM. Or the
matrix in the ACPI tables could be just wrong...

Right and as such it would be good if we can still add support to
it to the sensor driver in question. Because the ROTM info usually
is correct and avoids the need for adding more and more hwdb entries.

Note there already is existing support in some other sensor drivers.

So we probably need to factor out some helper code for this and share
that between sensor drivers.

We actually have a quirk mechanism in the kernel for specifying
the need for: video=DSI-1:panel_orientation=right_side_up  and this
will also automatically fix the fbcon orientation, see:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/drm_panel_orientation_quirks.c

If you submit a patch for this upstream please Cc me.

Hans
