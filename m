Could be multiple BARs, but yes.

Yes. It will call some variant of of_platform_populate().

I asked for things to be split up as the original series did a lot 
of new things at once. This series only works with the QEMU PCI test 
device which the DT unittest will use.

Because the PCI device needs a DT node and we can't just put PCI devices 
in the DT root. We have to create the bus hierarchy.

All the way.

Yes. Plus above the host bridge could have a hierarchy of nodes.

This was discussed early on. I don't think it would work to create the 
nodes at the time we discover we have a device that wants a DT node. The 
issue is decisions are made in the code based on whether there's a DT 
node for a PCI device or not. It might work, but I think it's fragile to 
have nodes attached to devices at different points in time.

Hum, what's the property for? It's new in this version. Any DT property 
needs to be documented, but I don't see why we need it.
