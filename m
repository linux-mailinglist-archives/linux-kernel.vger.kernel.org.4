Modern interactive systems, such as recent Android phones, tend to have
power efficient shallow idle states. Selecting deeper idle states on a
device while a latency-sensitive workload is running can adversely impact
performance due to increased latency. Additionally, if the CPU wakes up
from a deeper sleep before its target residency as is often the case, it
results in a waste of energy on top of that.

This patch extends the TEO governor with a mechanism adding util-awareness,
effectively providing a way for the governor to reduce the selected idle
state by 1 when the CPU is being utilized over a certain threshold while
still trying to select the deepest possible state using TEO's metrics when
the CPU is not being utilized. This is now possible since the CPU
utilization is exported from the scheduler with the sched_cpu_util function
and already used e.g. in the thermal governor IPA.

Under this implementation, when the CPU is being utilised and the
selected candidate state is C1, it will be reduced to C0 as long as C0
is not a polling state. This effectively should make the patch have no
effect on most Intel systems.

This can provide drastically decreased latency and performance benefits in
certain types of mobile workloads that are sensitive to latency,
such as Geekbench 5.

+ *
+ * The idea behind the util-awareness extension is that there are two distinct

+ * state selection - utilized and not utilized.
+ *
+ * In this case, 'utilized' means that the average runqueue util of the CPU is
+ * above a certain threshold.
+ *
+ * When the CPU is utilized while going into idle, more likely than not it will
+ * be woken up to do more work soon and so a shallower idle state should be
+ * selected to minimise latency and maximise performance. When the CPU is not
+ * being utilized, the usual metrics-based approach to selecting the deepest
+ * available idle state should be preferred to take advantage of the power
+ * saving.
+ *
+ * In order to achieve this, the governor uses a utilization threshold.
+ * The threshold is computed per-cpu as a percentage of the CPU's capacity
+ * by bit shifting the capacity value. Based on testing, the shift of 6 (~1.56%)
+ * seems to be getting the best results.
+ *
+ * Before selecting the next idle state, the governor compares the current CPU
+ * util to the precomputed util threshold. If it's below, it defaults to the
+ * TEO metrics mechanism. If it's above and the currently selected candidate is
+ * C1, the idle state will be reduced to C0 as long as C0 is not a polling state.
