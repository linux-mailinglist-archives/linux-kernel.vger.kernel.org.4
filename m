Actually, similar message can be seen on hotplugging the device. The
AER message will be gone shortly after the driver done it's probing.

This is something I really want to discuss.
This is not the first time that AER handling doesn't play well with
system resume because the error handling and resume routine can happen
at the same time. Some possible way going forward:
1) Serialize error recovery and resume routine.
  - If error recovery happens first and it's a successful recovery,
does the resume callback still need to be called?
  - If the device successfully resume, is the error recovery routine
still needed?
 So I think the most plausible way is to call error recovery only if
the resume fails. Ignore the AER if resume success.

2) Disable the AER interrupt during suspend
 - Since the AER is still recorded and AER interrupt gets enabled by
port driver before child device resuming, the error recovery/resume
race can still happen.
 - So the port services resume routines can only be called after the
entire PCIe hierarchy is resumed.

3) Disable the AER service completely during suspend
 - This is what's in my mind. If the AER is caused by firmware and
hardware (like most cases), the most feasible way is to workaround the
issue in the driver.

IMO ether 1) or 2) requires involvements that add little benefit. So
hopefully we can opt to 3).

I think I mentioned during previous discussion. The PTM gets enabled
by the firmware/hardware on the TBT dock right on S3 resume.
The issue is also logged on Windows' Event Viewer, but hardware vendor
doesn't care at all since the device is still functional :)

Please correct me if I am wrong, but Intel ethernet devices may need
the driver to perform some actions so the ownership can be switched
between software and firmware.
