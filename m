That's probably because it sounds to me you're trying to extend its 
genericness beyond the domain where it's generic. That is, you're looking 
for genericness outside of IPs (that have their own driver each) in Intel 
FPGA domain.

Whether that is "generic" enough to reside in drivers/base/regmap can
of course be debated but lets say I put it into drivers/mfd/ along with 
the code currently using it. By doing that, we'll postpone this discussion 
to the point when the first driver using it outside of drivers/mfd/ comes 
by. At that point, having the indirect code in drivers/mfd/ is shown to 
be a wrong choice.

It's of course nothing that couldn't be fixed by patches moving the code 
around to some more preferred location. And that location likely turns out 
to be drivers/base/regmap, no? Or do you have a better place for it in 
that case?

Please also keep in mind that we're talking about an FPGA device here, a 
device that is capable of implementing other devices that fall under 
various drivers/xx/. Obviously each would have a driver of their own so
there is no as strong only single device/driver mapping here as you might 
be thinking.
