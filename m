FWIW, yeah, had the same problems and already had asked for a link to
the patch submission. A few hours ago Jianmin Lv replied and pointed me
here: https://github.com/acpica/acpica/pull/866

/me meanwhile wonders if acpica-devel was abandoned or if its list
archive (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/acpica-devel/ ) is
just broken.

Not my area of expertise, but is this maybe something where we can
automatically enable async discard by default if some easily detectable
conditions are met? E.g. if the device supports PCIe 12.0, NVMe 9.1, or
was produced in 2030 and later (note, I used bogus numbers here on purpose).

Ciao, Thorsten
