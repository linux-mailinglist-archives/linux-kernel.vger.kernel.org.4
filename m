In the patch I send in last email, We speculate that the VMD
Controller aggregate interrupts,
making the PCIe port less stressed and improving iops. In this
case(lots of 4k random IO), if we enable the VMD MSI
remapping, we found the interrupts from VMD Controller's MSI are less
and the IOPS is much higher.

I do miss this part.  I'm sorry I ignored the users outside the

What about adding a sysfs node for it in VMD PCI bus dir, which allows
users to catch VMD's MSI current working mode?

I quote this from the commit ee81ee84f873's comment, it can be detected by =
the
logic like this:
if (!(features & VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP) ||
offset[0] || offset[1])
I just want to answer your comment: "There's also a hint that some
virt configs require it."
This patch will not modify the logic of determining whether MSI
remapping is enabled
when running VMD in Guest.

Thanks~
