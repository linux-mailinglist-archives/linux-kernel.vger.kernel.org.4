Right, the question is if it happens sufficiently enough that we even 
care and if there are not ways to mitigate.

It doesn't necessarily have to scale with the #VCPUs I think. What 
should dominate the overall time in theory how long it takes for one 
VCPU (the slowest one) to leave the kernel.

I wondered if

1) it might be easier to have a single KVM mechanism/call to kick all 
VCPUs out of KVM instead of doing it per VCPU. That might speed up 
things eventually heavily already.

2) One thing I wondered is whether the biggest overhead is actually 
taking the locks in QEMU and not actually waiting for the VCPUs. Maybe 
we could optimize that as well. (for now I use one lock per VCPU because 
it felt like it would reduce the ioctl overhead; maybe there is a better 
alternative to balance between both users)

So treat my patch as a completely unoptimized version.
