It means that you didn't try sriov_drivers_autoprobe. Once it is set to
true, It won't even try to probe VFs.

This is also cryptic to me. In standard SR-IOV deployment, all VFs are
created and configured while operator booted the machine with sriov_drivers_autoprobe
set to false. Once this machine is ready, VFs are assigned to relevant VMs/users
through orchestration SW (IMHO, it is supported by all orchestration SW). 

And only last part (assigning to users) is time-sensitive operation.

I wondered, are you using real HW? or QEMU SR-IOV? What is your server
that supports such large number of VFs?

BTW, Your change will probably break all SR-IOV devices in the market as
they rely on PCI subsystem to have VFs ready and configured.

Thanks
