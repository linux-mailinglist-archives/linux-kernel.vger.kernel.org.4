But what about NMIs, afaict this is all horribly broken for NMIs.

So the whole VMX thing latches the NMI (which stops NMI recursion),
right?

But then you drop out of noinstr code, which means any random exception
can happen (kprobes #BP, hw_breakpoint #DB, or even #PF due to random
nonsense like *SAN). This exception will do IRET and clear the NMI
latch, all before you get to run any of the NMI code.

Note how the normal NMI code is very careful to clear DR7 and both
kprobes and hw_breakpoint know not to accept noinstr code as targets.

You threw all that out the window.

Also, NMI is IST, and with FRED it will run on a different stack as
well, directly calling external_interrupt() doesn't honour that either.

I really really hate this with a passion. The fact that it's been this
way is no justification for keeping it. Crap is crap.

Intel should have taken an example of SVM in this regard, and not
doubled down and extended this NMI hole to regular IRQs. These are
exactly the kind of exception delivery trainwrecks FRED is supposed to
fix, except in this case it appears it doesn't :/
