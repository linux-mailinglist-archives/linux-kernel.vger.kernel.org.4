I guess I should have mentioned, that the results presented in the
commit message are from L2 guest, where there are no NUMA nodes and thus
every core is calibrated individually and thus boot time grows linearly
with the number of the cores assigned.

I'm not sure though, would NUMA emulation be a right choice here or
should this boot time penalty be left as is because we can't guarantee
all the processes are in the same numa node and thus their lpj values
have to be measured.

What do you think, Michael?
