There is a check in kernel/sched/idle.c which determines whether cpuidle
is enabled. If that isn't the case, functions necessary for s2idle don't
get executed. Here's a snippet of the code:

        if (cpuidle_not_available(drv, dev)) {
                tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick();

                default_idle_call();
                goto exit_idle;
        }

        /*
         * Suspend-to-idle ("s2idle") is a system state in which all user space
         * has been frozen, all I/O devices have been suspended and the only
         * activity happens here and in interrupts (if any). In that case bypass
         * the cpuidle governor and go straight for the deepest idle state
         * available.  Possibly also suspend the local tick and the entire
         * timekeeping to prevent timer interrupts from kicking us out of idle
         * until a proper wakeup interrupt happens.
         */

        if (idle_should_enter_s2idle() || dev->forced_idle_latency_limit_ns) {
                u64 max_latency_ns;

                if (idle_should_enter_s2idle()) {

                        entered_state = call_cpuidle_s2idle(drv, dev);
                        if (entered_state > 0)
                                goto exit_idle;

                        max_latency_ns = U64_MAX;
                } else {
                        max_latency_ns = dev->forced_idle_latency_limit_ns;
                }

                tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick();

                next_state = cpuidle_find_deepest_state(drv, dev, max_latency_ns);
                call_cpuidle(drv, dev, next_state);
        } else {
                bool stop_tick = true;

                /*
                 * Ask the cpuidle framework to choose a convenient idle state.
                 */
                next_state = cpuidle_select(drv, dev, &stop_tick);

                if (stop_tick || tick_nohz_tick_stopped())
                        tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick();
                else
                        tick_nohz_idle_retain_tick();

                entered_state = call_cpuidle(drv, dev, next_state);
                /*
                 * Give the governor an opportunity to reflect on the outcome
                 */
                cpuidle_reflect(dev, entered_state);
        }

exit_idle:
        __current_set_polling();

        /*
         * It is up to the idle functions to reenable local interrupts
         */
        if (WARN_ON_ONCE(irqs_disabled()))
                local_irq_enable();

The suspend subsystem doesn't have the check which determines whether
cpuidle is enabled or not. Therefore, the suspend subsystem can put the
system into s2idle even though functions necessary for s2idle in the
idle subsystem hasn't been executed.

There are programs such as systemd, which depend on CLOCK_MONOTONIC
being paused during suspend as outlined here:

Sorry for the confusion, I hope this cleared some things up.
