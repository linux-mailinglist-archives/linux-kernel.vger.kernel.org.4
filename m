More code, more memory, more CPU to parse all the text files. Parsing
kallsyms is quite expensive, so avoiding this would be great.

There are BPF tools that allow user to specify regex/glob of kernel
functions to attach to. This regex/glob is checked against
available_filter_functions to check which functions are traceable. All
good. But then also it's important to have corresponding memory
addresses for selected functions (for many reasons, e.g., to have
non-ambiguous and fast attachment by address instead of by name, or
for some post-processing based on captured IP addresses, etc). And
that means that now we need to also parse /proc/kallsyms and
cross-join it with data fetched from available_filter_functions.

All this is unnecessary if avalable_filter_functions would just
provide function address in the first place. It's a huge
simplification. And saves memory and CPU.

it's minor, I'm fine with whatever name, I'm searching for it in my
history every single time anyways :)

This would modify behavior for entire system, right? I think this is
very bad. Just because one application is aware of this option and
wants to turn this on, doesn't mean that all other applications that
might also use available_filter_functions should immediately break on
that machine.

Please, let's have a separate file. There is no downside to that.

I can use ftrace (through BPF) without mounting tracefs, right? So it
would be good to have a list of attachable kprobes without having to
worry whether tracefs was mounted or not. It's no big deal, I was just
curious if there has to be a tie to tracefs.

Quite a lot, especially when you have to do all that in pure C.
