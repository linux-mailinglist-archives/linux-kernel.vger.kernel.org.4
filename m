This is not all kernel internals, just the functions allowed for error
injection.

Yes, BPF provides no guarantee that kernel functions will remain
stable (similar to tracepoints and kprobes).

This annotation already exists, i.e. ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION

Users, with CONFIG_FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION, can already modify return
values of kernel functions using kprobes and the failure injection
framework [1] for functions annotated with ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION.

BPF just provides another way to do the same thing with "modify
return" programs and this also respects the error injection list [2]
and users can *only* attach these programs to the functions annotated
with ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION.

You can list the BPF programs that are loaded in the kernel with

# bpftool prog list

Also, the BPF programs show up in call stacks when you are debugging.

There are workloads and applications (e.g. https://kubearmor.io/) that
already use BPF Tracing and LSM programs and are currently blocked on
their ARM server deployments.

This may be obvious, but I want to reiterate that while the attachment
points are not UAPI and users have to tolerate kernel function
changes, they do expect the core loading and attachment mechanisms to
exist (i.e. the ability to use LSM and tracing programs).
