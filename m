I just found this on the mailing list.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1560468577-101178-8-git-send-email-yang.shi@linux.alibaba.com/

But it didn't have the throttling logic, I may not submit that version
to the mailing list since we decided to drop this and merge mine and
Dave's.

Anyway it is not hard to add the throttling logic, we already have a
few throttling cases in vmscan, for example, "mm/vmscan: throttle
reclaim until some writeback completes if congested".
