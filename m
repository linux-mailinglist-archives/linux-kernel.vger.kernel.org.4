Hi,

> Why not?

To me it is very simple:

Look at this:

-#define FE_GET_PROPERTY                   _IOR('o', 83, struct 
dtv_properties)
+#define FE_GET_PROPERTY                   _IOW('o', 83, struct 
dtv_properties)
+#define FE_GET_PROPERTY_OLD       _IOR('o', 83, struct dtv_properties)

The FE_GET_PROPERTY IOCTL definition is incorrectly specified as reading 
data. While it is actually writing data. When will this be fixed in 
Linux - I think never. That's just the way both Linux and GIT works, 
unfortunately, though that's another discussion. You can put stuff in, 
but you can't easily get stuff out, without it having consequences.

Similarly rustc may depend on an incorrectly specified ioctl() 
definition, also via other libraries and static linking, that just have 
to stay incorrectly defined, because it was initially incorrectly defined.

Daniel, please explain why the few lines of chunk above (and there are 
some more) cannot be upstreamed into Linux?

I'm trying to explain something difficult. And I'm OK that you neither 
understand nor agree about my viewpoint. See my replies above.
