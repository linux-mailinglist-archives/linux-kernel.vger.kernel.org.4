Right, it makes sense to me. That is why I am thinking that we should 
have an API like may_have_task_cpu_possible_mask() that returns true for 
heterogeneous systems. That will allow us to apply some optimizations in 
systems with homogeneous cpus. So far, this is an arm64 only feature. We 
shouldn't penalize other arches because arm64 needs that. In the future, 
maybe more arches will have that.

Longman
