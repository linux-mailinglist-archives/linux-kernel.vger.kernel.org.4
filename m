Hi,
I think that the XDMA driver will always be used by a superior PCIe card 
driver like in our case (mgb4) and using it separately makes no sense/is 
not possible, so disabling it until some of the superior drivers selects 
it makes sense for me. But what about out-of-the-tree modules based on 
xdma? Making the module "invisible" will make compile them much harder I 
guess? And there will be proprietary drivers based on xdma, see Xilinx 
XRT: https://github.com/houlz0507/XRT-1/tree/xdma_v4_usage

The xdma authors from Xilinx will definitely give you a more 
authoritative answer. I'm just a "random" user of the xdma module. 
Originally our mgb4 driver was based on our own xdma sub-driver (in turn 
based on some old "test" driver from Xilinx) which I was glad we could 
abandon when this xdma driver has appeared. I helped the xdma module to 
become usable for PCIe cards like our v4l2 grabber, but the original 
intents of the xdma driver are unknown to me. If it is XRT, than Xilinx 
will probably like the module to stay visible.

M.
