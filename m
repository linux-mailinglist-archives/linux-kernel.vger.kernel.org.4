I think this is great.  It shouldn't have taken me this long, so
thanks for persevering.

I think we can use pci_upstream_bridge() as below.  Let me know if
not.

Here it is as I applied to pci/resource for v6.1:

commit 0e3281839742 ("PCI: Sanitise firmware BAR assignments behind a PCI-PCI bridge")
Author: Maciej W. Rozycki <macro@orcam.me.uk>
Date:   Wed Sep 21 20:49:16 2022 +0100

    PCI: Sanitise firmware BAR assignments behind a PCI-PCI bridge
    
    When pci_assign_resource() is unable to assign resources to a BAR, it uses
    pci_revert_fw_address() to fall back to a firmware assignment (if any).
    Previously pci_revert_fw_address() assumed all addresses could reach the
    device, but this is not true if the device is below a bridge that only
    forwards addresses within its windows.
    
    This problem was observed on a Tyan Tomcat IV S1564D system where the BIOS
    did not assign valid addresses to several bridges and USB devices:
    
      pci 0000:00:11.0: PCI-to-PCIe bridge to [bus 01-ff]
      pci 0000:00:11.0:   bridge window [io  0xe000-0xefff]
      pci 0000:01:00.0: PCIe Upstream Port to [bus 02-ff]
      pci 0000:01:00.0:   bridge window [io  0x0000-0x0fff]   # unreachable
      pci 0000:02:02.0: PCIe Downstream Port to [bus 05-ff]
      pci 0000:02:02.0:   bridge window [io  0x0000-0x0fff]   # unreachable
      pci 0000:05:00.0: PCIe-to-PCI bridge to [bus 06-ff]
      pci 0000:05:00.0:   bridge window [io  0x0000-0x0fff]   # unreachable
      pci 0000:06:08.0: USB UHCI 1.1
      pci 0000:06:08.0: BAR 4: [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]            # unreachable
      pci 0000:06:08.1: USB UHCI 1.1
      pci 0000:06:08.1: BAR 4: [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]            # unreachable
      pci 0000:06:08.0: can't claim BAR 4 [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]: no compatible bridge window
      pci 0000:06:08.1: can't claim BAR 4 [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]: no compatible bridge window
    
    During the first pass of assigning unassigned resources, there was not
    enough I/O space available, so we couldn't assign the 06:08.0 BAR and
    reverted to the firmware assignment (still unreachable).  Reverting the
    06:08.1 assignment failed because it conflicted with 06:08.0:
    
      pci 0000:00:11.0:   bridge window [io  0xe000-0xefff]
      pci 0000:01:00.0: no space for bridge window [io  size 0x2000]
      pci 0000:02:02.0: no space for bridge window [io  size 0x1000]
      pci 0000:05:00.0: no space for bridge window [io  size 0x1000]
      pci 0000:06:08.0: BAR 4: no space for [io  size 0x0020]
      pci 0000:06:08.0: BAR 4: trying firmware assignment [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]
      pci 0000:06:08.1: BAR 4: no space for [io  size 0x0020]
      pci 0000:06:08.1: BAR 4: trying firmware assignment [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]
      pci 0000:06:08.1: BAR 4: [io  0xfce0-0xfcff] conflicts with 0000:06:08.0 [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]
    
    A subsequent pass assigned valid bridge windows and a valid 06:08.1 BAR,
    but left the 06:08.0 BAR alone, so the UHCI device was still unusable:
    
      pci 0000:00:11.0:   bridge window [io  0xe000-0xefff] released
      pci 0000:00:11.0:   bridge window [io  0x1000-0x2fff]   # reassigned
      pci 0000:01:00.0:   bridge window [io  0x1000-0x2fff]   # reassigned
      pci 0000:02:02.0:   bridge window [io  0x2000-0x2fff]   # reassigned
      pci 0000:05:00.0:   bridge window [io  0x2000-0x2fff]   # reassigned
      pci 0000:06:08.0: BAR 4: assigned [io  0xfce0-0xfcff]   # left alone
      pci 0000:06:08.1: BAR 4: assigned [io  0x2000-0x201f]
      ...
      uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host system error, PCI problems?
      uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host controller process error, something bad happened!
      uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host controller halted, very bad!
      uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: HCRESET not completed yet!
      uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: HC died; cleaning up
    
    If the address assigned by firmware is not reachable because it's not
    within upstream bridge windows, fail instead of assigning the unusable
    address from firmware.
