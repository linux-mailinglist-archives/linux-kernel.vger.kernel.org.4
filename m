This will need to be updated to apply on top of Lukas' patches since
they change the same area.  You could rebase on top of:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pci/pci.git/commit/?id=53b54ad074de

It also will need a concise description of what this fixes and why we
want it.  I see that it changes the time we wait after a secondary bus
reset, but I have to read the patch itself to figure out what's going
on.
