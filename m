OK, thinking more about this and searching through the history, I've
realized why the conversion is originally in ext4_page_mkwrite(). The
problem is described in commit 7b4cc9787fe35b ("ext4: evict inline data
when writing to memory map") but essentially it boils down to the fact that
ext4 writeback code does not expect dirty page for a file with inline data
because ext4_write_inline_data_end() should have copied the data into the
inode and cleared the folio's dirty flag.

Indeed messing with xattrs from the writeback path to copy page contents
into inline data xattr would be ... interesting. Hum, out of good ideas for
now :-|.
