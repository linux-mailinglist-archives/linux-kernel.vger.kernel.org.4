In short, you suggest to move the array of used klp_shadow_types from
struct klp_object to struct klp_patch. Do I get it correctly?

I see. We would not need to explicitly register the shadow type using
klp_shadow_register() and allocate struct klp_shadow_type_reg
for the reference counter.

From my POV, this is similar to "func_stack" in struct "klp_ops".
The list was originally designed for non-replace livepatches because
the same function might be livepatched many times.

It might theoretically get "simplified" when only the atomic replace is
supported. Then there would be the maximum of two livepatches
and the (infinite) list would be an overhead.

I say theoretically because the list is actually quite elegant
solution.

This is not clear to me. The new livepatch might also use less shadow
variables. It must not blindly take over all shadow variables which
were owned by the previous livepatch.

From the patch author POV:

If the autodetection did not work then the patch author would still
need to provide the array of used shadow types. I agree that only
one array in struct klp_patch might be enough.


From the implementation POV:

I agree that the code might be easier if we support only atomic
replace. We would not need the reference counter in this case.

But I am not sure if this is acceptable for users that do not use
the atomic replace. They suffer from the same problem. Do we really
want to make this mode a 2nd citizen? IMHO, all applicable features
have been implemented for both modes so far.
