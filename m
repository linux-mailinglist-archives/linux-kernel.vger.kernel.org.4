I do experienced this problem and this patch fixed it.

No, I don't know if there is extra flags or optimizations.

Even if they are on the same device it is two type of memory.
I am not an PCIe expert but I suppose the PCIe controller of the board is
sending to both memory and if one of them (LL memory here) is slower in the
write process then we faced this race issue. We can not find out that the w=
rite
to LL memory has finished before the CSRs even if the write command has been
sent earlier.
