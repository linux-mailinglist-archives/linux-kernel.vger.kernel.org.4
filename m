This paragraph seems redundant. It more or less repeats what
is said in the previous one.

I am never sure how the co-authoring should be done ;-) But I believe
that the author should always be the first one. And the other author
should be listed either by Co-developer-by: or by Signed-off-by: but
not by both tags. So, it should be:

Signed-off-by: Marcos Paulo de Souza <mpdesouza@suse.com>
Co-developed-by: Petr Mladek <pmladek@suse.com>


With the removed paragraph and updated tags:

Reviewed-by: Petr Mladek <pmladek@suse.com>

Best Regards,
Petr


PS: No need to resend the patch. I could do the two changes
    when pushing it.
