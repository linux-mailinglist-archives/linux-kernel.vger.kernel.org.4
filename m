Right, "make the allocation succeed later" is entirely missing the point 
of this code. The only reason we're doing that allocation at all is to 
reserve a 32-bit bus address. If it fails, it means we can't reliably 
support endpoints with only a 32-bit MSI capability. Using a bigger mask 
in order to successfully reserve a >32-bit bus address basically 
*guarantees* that you can't support endpoints with only a 32-bit MSI 
capability.

Thanks Rob for digging up that thread; the original idea there should 
still be fine, but the alternative suggestion from Serge at the end is 
potentially even better for this situation where it's down to the SoC's 
memory map rather than the kernel config. It just needs somebody with 
sufficient motivation and resources to write and test a patch :)

Robin.
