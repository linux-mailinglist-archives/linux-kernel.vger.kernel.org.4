-EBUSY should be very unlikely. No good idea how to explain it as a user manual/doc.

don't mind to leave the "Can lock this hashtab bucket?" as is in the diagram. I 
was just thinking a simpler diagram may be easier to grab the big picture quickly.

shrink should try to shrink a couple of stale elems which are likely hashed to 
different buckets. If shrink hits htab_lock_bucket() EBUSY on all stale elems, 
shrink could fail but unlikely.

raw_spin_lock_irqsave() is done after the percpu counter, so there is a gap but 
not sure if it matters though unless the production use case can really hit it.
