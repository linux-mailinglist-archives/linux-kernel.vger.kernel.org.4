Sounds good, I'll include that in the v3 iteration of the patch set. We
can worry about black-listing certain unsafe tracing programs, and doing
whatever other fancier things we can think of as well later.

Makes sense, I think I know what needs to change and it should only be a
few small places in the verifier (plus the testing we'll add to validate
it).

Alright, works for me. Let me mess around with this and see if it's as
easy as we think it is. If so, v3 will include those changes. If not,
it'll just include a couple of small fixes that Martin pointed out on
the v2 revision.

Thanks for reviewing these patches.
