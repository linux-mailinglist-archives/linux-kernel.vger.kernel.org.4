Ok I misinterpreted what this function does.

I see the discrepency now -- our system is actually an embedded
platform without an RTC. So it thinks that it is "1970" every time it
boots up, at least until it connects to the internet or similar, which
it may or may not ever do. We use NFS to share mountpoints between 2
linux systems on our board connected via usb-ethernet. The fact that
it allows simultaneous access gives it an advantage over other
protocols like mass storage.

Its likely that the code is working as intended then, it just didn't
take our particular usecase into account.

Sure I've added this simple debug print with the necessary info

Do you think we'd be able to handle this case cleanly?
