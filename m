It looks like we had it, but we took it out (by the way, we were
enabling packed even though we didn't support it):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6234f80574d7569444d8718355fa2838e92b158b

The only problem I see is that for each new feature we have to modify 
the kernel.
Could we have new features that don't require handling by vhost-vdpa?

Thanks,
Stefano
