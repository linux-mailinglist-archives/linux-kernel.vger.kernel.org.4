The correct solution is to describe hardware. The hardware is memory
controller. There is no hardware called "scaller of memory controller".
There is no hardware called "EDAC" because that's purely a Linux term.

Your DTS should accurately describe the hardware, not drivers. Then
drivers can do whatever they want with it - have safe, non-concurrent
access or keep poking same registers and break things...

I don't think there is EDAC and "refresh-rate" hardwares. There is
memory controller.

All these problems look like started from wrong hardware description, so
not sure if it is worth fixing something where the basis is already not
correct.
