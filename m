I observed exactly same behavior as you described, on Armada 385 and
similar also on Armada 3720.

I have not documented this behavior in any document.

No, I mean programming Link Control 2 register in PCIe capabilities
section of PCIe Root Port device (the one which is implemented throw
emulated bridge kernel code).

It should be programmed dynamically after detecting type of upstream
device to the PCIe Root Port (other end of the serdes link).

Yes, due to this reason it should be rather implemented dynamically in
kernel code instead of "hacking" DTS files as it does not really fix it.
