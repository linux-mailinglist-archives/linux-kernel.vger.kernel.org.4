I just gave this a quick spin on the sc8280xp-crd, and unfortunately
this change appears to break suspend (e.g. hangs during suspend or
resume). Setting a non-zero (250 MBps) peak bandwidth during suspend
makes things work again.

Presumably something is relying on these interconnect clocks to remain
enabled. And isn't that expected as we need to set a non-zero icc bw to
enable the interconnect clocks during probe?

I'm afraid I won't have time to look into this for a while myself, but
have you tried this on the CRD, Mani? 

One obvious difference is the modem on the CRD which I believe neither
of our X13s have, but this seems like more of a general problem.
