Sure.

As of today the effective mask of MSI interrupts contains only online
CPUs. I don't see a reason for that to change.

I'm not aware of one today. That was more a theoretical reasoning.

Correct, but if the interrupt _is_ masked at the MSI level then the
hypervisor must not deliver an interrupt at all.

The point is that it is valid to target a masked MSI entry to an offline
CPU under the assumption that the hardware/emulation respects the
masking. Whether that's a good idea or not is a different question.

The kernel as of today does not do that. It targets unused but
configured MSI[-x] entries towards MANAGED_IRQ_SHUTDOWN_VECTOR on CPU0
for various reasons, one of them being paranoia.

But in principle there is nothing wrong with that and it should either
succeed or being rejected at the software level and not expose a
completely invalid CPU number to the hypercall in the first place.

So if you want to be defensive, then keep the _and(), but then check the
result for being valid and emit something useful like a pr_warn_once()
instead of blindly handing the invalid result to the hypercall and then
have that reject it with some undecipherable error code.

Actually it would not necessarily reach the hypercall because before
that it dereferences cpumask_of(nr_cpu_ids) here:

	nr_bank = cpumask_to_vpset(&(intr_desc->target.vp_set),	cpumask_of(cpu));

and explode with a kernel pagefault. If not it will read some random
adjacent data and try to create a vp_set from it. Neither of that is
anywhere close to correct.

Thanks,
