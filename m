I understand what you're saying, but clearing an A-bit on a non-leaf PMD th=
at
_just_ got converted from a leaf PMD is "wrong" if and only if the intented
behavior is nonsensical.

Without an explicit granluarity from the caller, the intent is to either (a=
) reap
A-bit on leaf PTEs, or (b) reap A-bit at the highest possible granularity. =
 (a) is
nonsensical because because it provides zero guarantees to the caller as to=
 the
granularity of the information.  Leaf vs. non-leaf matters for the life cyc=
le of
page tables and guest accesses, e.g. KVM needs to zap _only_ leaf SPTEs whe=
n
handling an mmu_notifier invalidation, but when it comes to the granularity=
 of the
A-bit, leaf vs. non-leaf has no meaning.  On KVM x86, a PMD covers 2MiB of =
GPAs
regardless of whether it's a leaf or non-leaf PMD.

If the intent is (b), then clearing the A-bit on a PMD a few cycles after t=
he PMD
was converted from leaf to non-leaf is a pointless distinction, because it =
yields
the same end result as clearing the A-bit just a few cycles earlier, when t=
he PMD
was a leaf.

Actually, if I'm reading patch 5 correctly, this is all much ado about noth=
ing,
because the MGLRU code only kicks in only for non-huge PTEs, and KVM cannot=
 have
larger mappings than the primary MMU, i.e. should not encounter huge PTEs.

On that topic, if the assumption is that the bitmap is used only for non-hu=
ge PTEs,
then x86's kvm_arch_test_clear_young() needs to be hardened to process only=
 4KiB
PTEs, and probably to WARN if a huge PTE is encountered.  That assumption s=
hould
also be documented.

If that assumption is incorrect, then kvm_arch_test_clear_young() is broken=
 and/or
the expected behavior of the bitmap isn't fully defined.
