Ah ok, I was aware of that "semi-RCU" fallback logic in tlb_remove_table(),
but that is rather a generic issue, and not s390-specific. I thought you
meant some s390-oddity here, of which we have a lot, unfortunately...
Of course, we call tlb_remove_table() from our page_table_free_rcu(), so
I guess you could say that page_table_free_rcu() cannot guarantee what
tlb_remove_table() cannot guarantee.

Maybe change to "which page_table_free_rcu() does not actually guarantee,
by calling tlb_remove_table()", to make it clear that this is not a problem
of page_table_free_rcu() itself.

Yes, we should be fine with that, current code can be trusted :-)

Oh yes, if your changes would have allowed to get rid of that "semi RCU"
logic, that would really be a major boost in popularity, I guess. But
it probably is as it is, because it is not so easily fixed...

Yes, I also see no functional issue here. Just thought that the extra
write could be avoided, e.g. by checking for list_empty() or mask first.
But I guess that is simply the benefit of list_del_init(), that you
don't have to check, at least if it is guaranteed that rcu_head is
never in use here.

Then maybe adjust the comment, because now it makes you wonder, when
you read (and understand) the code, you see that this list_del_init()
might also be called for pages not on the list.

That is actually the one thing I still try to figure out, by drawing
pictures, i.e. if we really really never end up here on list_del_init(),
while using rcu_head, e.g. by racing PageActive.

Yes, that is what makes this approach so nice, i.e. no more checking
for HH bits or worry about double call_rcu(), simply do the the freeing
whenever the page is ready. At least in theory, still drawing pictures :-)

But this really looks very good to me, and also works with LTP not worse
than the other approaches.
