I had previously only done smpboot time measurements for the whole 
patchset, but I tested the patchset without this commit and it doesn't 
make a difference to smpboot time as its negligable work to read those 
MTRR MSRs into mtrr_state.fixed_ranges.
This commit is also independent of parallel smp bringup, similar to 
reusing timer calibration so I think it could be considered as a 
separate patchset if needed. I will post the next revision without this 
commit, but here is my view on MTRR save/restore (which shouldn't matter 
for the next revision...).

If the MTRR changes on a running system, there might be a bug during 
hotplug in the original code that handles MTRR? which is also carried 
over in this patch.
 From what I can see, MTRR is only saved+restored during initial boot, 
hotplugging CPU and __save/__restore_processor_state() (used in creating 
image for hibernation, suspend, kexec...). So if for e.g. in a running 
system (that has not hibernated, suspended, kexeced), if MTRR for CPU0 
(first_cpu) changed post-boot and CPU3 is hotplugged, only MTRR for CPU3 
is updated and CPU0 and CPU3 will hold the same value, while the rest of 
the CPUs will have the older first-boot value? This behavior will happen 
with or without this patch. I think this is what Thomas is referring to 
above when he says that the cached values want to be updated? But the 
issue is present in the original code as well.

Thanks!
