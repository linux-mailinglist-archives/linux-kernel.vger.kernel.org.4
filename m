How would all the sub devices be defined by the PCI config space other
than a VID/PID implies *everything*. That's the same as the pre-DT
world where the ARM machine ID number (from RMK's registry) implied
everything. These days, we can have an entire SoC exposed behind a PCI
BAR which I think is pretty much Clement's usecase. Putting an SoC
behind a PCI BAR is no more discoverable than a "normal" SoC.

Not instead of. There's the PCI driver for the FPGA or SoC bus with
multiple unrelated devices behind it. The PCI driver is just a bus
driver much like we have for various custom SoC bus drivers.

I don't see how your example relates to this in any way whatsoever.
We're talking about different discovery mechanisms, not different
driver models/environments.

The downstream devices don't have their own PCI config space. That
won't work. PCI drivers expect a device with PCI config space. Devices
to drivers are always 1:1, so we couldn't share the config space among
multiple drivers or something. For devices which are not discoverable
like these are, our choices are DT, ACPI or s/w nodes (aka
platform_data 2.0).

That only makes sense for something that is a single driver. Not the
case here. For the FPGA, the devices are not known up front.

For the same reason as 1, that simply won't work.

Yes...

We now have 3 different use cases all needing the same thing. The
3rd[1] is the recent test infrastructure change to have test devices
added. They all have non-discoverable devices downstream of a PCI
device. We need a solution here.
