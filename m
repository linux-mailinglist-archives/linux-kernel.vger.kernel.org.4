I have a test example that run DMA stress transfer in 3 threads and
the issue appear in only few transfers but each time I run my test.

No it is another custom driver but also communicating through PCIe. In fact=
 I
have a contact to the FPGA designer, I will ask them.

I was meaning hardware memory. Yes they are mapped via MMIO, but they are
mapped to two different BAR which may map the CSRs or the memory where LL
are stored. According to you the write should be ordered but is there a way
to know that the write has succeed?=20

I thought that using a read will solve the issue like the gpio_nand driver
(gpio_nand_dosync) but I didn't thought of a cache that could return the va=
lue
of the read even if the write doesn't fully happen. In the case of a cache =
how
could we know that the write is done without using a delay?=20

dma_wmb is like wmb and is called by the writel function of the doorbell.
io_stop_wc is doing nothing except or arm64.
Both of these function won't change anything.

Delaying it for at least 4 us before toggling doorbell solves also the issu=
e.
This seems long for an equivalent of the readl function right?
Wouldn't using a read after the write ask to the PCIe controller to check t=
he
write has happen? It should be written in the PCIe protocol but not sure I =
want
to open the full protocol description document.
