Work with other x86 hardware vendors to define a common interface?  Ask hypervisor
developers to define a common, extensible interface?

Maybe it turns out that it's impossible to abstract anything away and everything
ends up being vendor-specific anyways, but not even trying to provide a common
interace is extremely frustrating, especially since all this mitigation stuff has
been going on for ~5 years.  There's been plenty of time to establish relationships
and points of contact.

No, KVM doing its own thing would only exacerbate the issue.

Hence my frustration.
