The x86 EFI code in Linux makes changes to the EFI memory map in many
different places in the code. On other architectures, we have managed
to avoid this, so that the EFI memory map is always identical to the
one provided by the firmware at boot.

Not really, no. So you would have to convert the entire region
/unless/ Xen knows the GUID, and therefore knows how to derive the
size of the table, allowing it to reserve memory more conservatively.
However, I doubt whether this is worth it: splitting entries implies
rewriting the memory map, which is a thing I'd rather avoid if I were
in your shoes.

Right.
