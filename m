Right, I assume Intel and AMD behaved in the same way here.

Isn't that a terrible user-space interface? "If someone else is reading a similar file,
neither of you make progress".

The monitor might get re-allocated, re-programmed and become valid for a different
PARTID+PMG in the mean time. I don't think these things should remain allocated over a
return to user-space. Without doing that I don't see how we can return-early and make
progress.

How long should a CSU monitor remain allocated to a PARTID+PMG? Currently its only for the
duration of the read() syscall on the file.


The problem with MPAM is too much of it is optional. This particular behaviour is only
valid for CSU monitors, (llc_occupancy), and then, only if your hardware designers didn't
have a value to hand when the monitor is programmed, and need to do a scan of the cache to
come up with a result. The retry is only triggered if the hardware sets NRDY.
This is also only necessary if there aren't enough monitors for every RMID/(PARTID*PMG) to
have its own. If there were enough, the monitors could be allocated and programmed at
startup, and the whole thing becomes cheaper to access.

If a hardware platform needs time to do this, it has to come from somewhere. I don't think
maintaining an epoch based list of which monitor secretly belongs to a PARTID+PMG in the
hope user-space reads the file again 'quickly enough' is going to be maintainable.

If returning errors early is an important use-case, I can suggest ensuring the MPAM driver
allocates CSU monitors up-front if there are enough (today it only does this for MBWU
monitors). We then have to hope that folk who care about this also build hardware
platforms with enough monitors.


Thanks,

James
