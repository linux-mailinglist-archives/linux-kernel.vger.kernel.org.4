I seem to recall at one point looking at kvfree_rcu (at least the one
argument variant), and I *thought* it would unconditionally allocate
memory so it could be put on a linked list to be freed after an RCU
grace period had elapsed.  But I tried tracing through the huge
numbers of cpp macros and other layers of #ifdef's and other
abstractions, and in my conference-induced sleep depreviation, it
caused my head to spin, and I gave up trying to trace it down so I had
100% confidence.

So if someone could document *all* of the k[v]free_* variants whether
it is safe/optimal to pass NULL to them, that would be great, thanks.
