My series also implements W^X for both UEFI and non-UEFI boot paths, but 
I
agree that we can just consider non-UEFI code legacy and it would be 
better
to avoid touching it and encourage everyone to use UEFI code path on x86
instead. If PE format will also get fixed with either my patches or some
others, I do like your approach more than mine, as it removes a lot of 
old
cruft but does not break things (as far as I see). Seems like a perfect
compromise between [1] and my approach.

I've briefly tested the patches and looked through them and they look 
good
to me. Two things I've noticed:
  * there's one TSC-related TODO;
  * probably we want to clear .bss in efi32_stub_entry and 
efi64_stub_entry
    for UEFI handover protocol, since it's unfortunately still present 
and
    .bss will contain garbage.
I'll probably do some more testing on the weekend and let you know if I
find something.

Please tell me if/when you are going to merge these or similar, and I 
will
clean up and rebase PE-related patches on top of these.

I'd also like to send W^X patches for EFISTUB (omitting the non-UEFI 
boot
path) as a follow up after the PE file header will get fixed. They will 
be
considerably smaller with this approach and will not touch legacy code.

Thanks,
