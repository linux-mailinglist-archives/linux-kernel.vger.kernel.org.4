We're also performing RMW through pcie_capability_read_word() +
pcie_capability_write_word() combos, see drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_hpc.c
for examples.

What I think is unnecessary and counterproductive is to add wholesale
locking of any access to the PCI Express Capability Structure.

It's fine to have a single spinlock, but I'd suggest only using it
for registers which are actually accessed concurrently by multiple
places in the kernel.

Yes that looks broken, so RTCTL would be another register besides
LNKCTL and LNKCTL2 that needs protection, good catch.

Thanks,
