I don't think so. If you create a new userspace, and give the process
the CAP_BPF or CAP_SYS_ADMIN in this new user namespace but not the
initial namespace, you can't do that. Because currently only CAP_BPF
or CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the init user namespace can load/attach bpf
programs.

They won't become ns_capable(CAP_BPF). If it becomes
ns_capable(CAP_BPF), it will really go wild then.

IIUC, it is the CAP_BPF which doesn't integrate with the user
namespaces, right?
