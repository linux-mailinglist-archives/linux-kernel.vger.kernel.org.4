Great, good to know it works well with asan for the basic use cases at least.

I guess $HOME is the default prefix unless you set it to other, then
make install will put
the binary there.  You can make sure if your PATH contains the ~/bin and use it.

But it's also possible you can run the perf without installing.  I
have a symlink in
my tmp directory to point to the recent build of the binary and use it
always. :)
To build, you can either 'cd tools/perf; make' or 'make -C tools/perf'
in the top
level linux source tree.  I also pass "BUILD_BPF_SKEL=1" to enable BPF.

Thanks,
Namhyung
