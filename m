Yeah, as I said in my cover letter, I am not happy with my solution,
but we should start somewhere to discuss it.

Yeah, the crash is only reproducible with the Rockchip system, or better,=
=20
the crash is reproducible only in some modern devices that use the old=20
Rockchip driver mentioned in this patch.

Yeah, I see, I see. This makes sense. Is there any path that I can follow i=
n=20
order to better understand what's going on at the hardware level? In other=
=20
words, how can I help to understand this issue better and provide a
unique solution for everybody?

Thanks for the nits in the patch, I will take a look with a fresh mind
later in the day.

Cheers!

Vincent.
