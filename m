Tried booting with the patch applied yesterday, no regression as far as I
could tell (still hitting the two add_taint() statements, but that's not
what the patch does).

I was trying to figure out how I could test that the other runtime services
are still working correctly, your suggestion is exactly what I was looking
for, thanks. The machine is a shared machine, will test when I get access
to it (hopefully later today) and post my findings.

Thanks,
Alex
