Hi,
  It's nice to see this full stack posted - thanks!

Are there any pointers to information on attestation and similar
measurement things?  In particular, are there any plans for a vTPM
for Realms - if there were, it would make life easy for us, since we
can share some user space stuff with other CoCo systems.
