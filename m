Thank you, I just tested this and it works wonderfully! Is this still on time for 6.3?
In case you need it:

Tested-by: Jeremi Piotrowski <jpiotrowski@linux.microsoft.com>

I'd also like to get this backported all the way back to 5.15 because the issue is
already present there. I tried it myself, but this was before async zap and i'm
doing something wrong with refcounts:

I tried:

kvm_mmu_uninit_tdp_mmu()
{
       kvm_tdp_mmu_invalidate_all_roots(kvm);
       kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_invalidated_roots(kvm);
}

and dropping the refcount_inc_not_zero() from kvm_tdp_mmu_invalidate_all_roots(),
but I hit:
