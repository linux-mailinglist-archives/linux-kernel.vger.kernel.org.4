I think I should have described my use case long ago, sorry :) My use
case does not involve exporting any timestamps. It involves using BPF
programs to measure the duration of events, so running one BPF program
before and one after, then subtracting the acquired timestamps.

What I was looking for is something fast enough for hot paths and also
consistent enough (in case the two BPF programs end up running on
different cpus), and also safe from all contexts to satisfy this
general BPF restriction.
