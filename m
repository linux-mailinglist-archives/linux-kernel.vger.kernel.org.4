So put briefly, in acpi_pci_bridge_d3() we fail to take wake capabilities
into account and blindly assume that a bridge can be runtime suspended
to D3 if it is power-manageable by ACPI.

By moving the acpi_pci_power_manageable() below the wake capabilities
checks, we avoid runtime suspending a bridge that is not wakeup capable.

The more verbose explanation in the commit message is useful to
understand how the issue was exposed, but it somewhat obscures
the issue itself.

Those double arrows are a little misleading, a device link is
unidirectional, so it's really <-- and not <->.

Huh?  I thought it's runtime suspended to D3hot even though it should stay
runtime resumed in D0 because it's not wakeup capable in D3hot?

This paragraph sounds like the problem is the router runtime suspended.
IIUC the router could only runtime suspend because its consumer, the
Root Port, runtime suspended.  By preventing the Root Port from runtime
suspending, you're implicitly preventing it's supplier (the router)
from suspending.

I think git.kernel.org links are preferred to 3rd party hosting services.

Thanks,
