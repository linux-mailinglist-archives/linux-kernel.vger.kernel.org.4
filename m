Heh, I don't necessarily "want" it this way, it's more that I don't see a compelling
reason to change KVM's behavior and risk silently causing a performance regression.
If KVM didn't already have the "APIC base may have RAM semantics" quirk, and/or if
this were the initial APICv implementation and thus no possible users, then I would
probably also vote to give APICv the same treatment.

Suffers the same SRCU issue (see below) :-/

Given the SRCU problem, I'd prefer to keep the management of the memslot in common
code, even though I agree it's a bit silly.  And KVM_REQ_UNBLOCK is a perfect fit
for dealing with the SRCU issue, i.e. handling this in AVIC code would require
another hook on top of spreading the memslot management across x86 and SVM code.

This should be handled already.  apic_access_memslot_enabled is toggled from
true=>false if and only if apic_access_memslot_inhibited is set, and the "enabled"
flag is protected by slots_lock.  Thus, newly created vCPUs are guaranteed to
either see apic_access_memslot_enabled==true or apic_access_memslot_inhibited==true.

  int kvm_alloc_apic_access_page(struct kvm *kvm)
  {
	struct page *page;
	void __user *hva;
	int ret = 0;

	mutex_lock(&kvm->slots_lock);
	if (kvm->arch.apic_access_memslot_enabled ||
	    kvm->arch.apic_access_memslot_inhibited)  <=== prevents reallocation
		goto out;

  out:
	mutex_unlock(&kvm->slots_lock);
	return ret;
  }

That could be made more obvious by adding a WARN in kvm_free_apic_access_page(), i.e.

  void kvm_free_apic_access_page(struct kvm *kvm)
  {
	WARN_ON_ONCE(!kvm->arch.apic_access_memslot_inhibited);

	mutex_lock(&kvm->slots_lock);

	if (kvm->arch.apic_access_memslot_enabled) {
		__x86_set_memory_region(kvm, APIC_ACCESS_PAGE_PRIVATE_MEMSLOT, 0, 0);
		kvm->arch.apic_access_memslot_enabled = false;
	}

	mutex_unlock(&kvm->slots_lock);
  }

No, KVM_REQ_UNHALT is being removed.  KVM_REQ_UNBLOCK needs to stay, although it
has a rather weird name, e.g. KVM_REQ_WORK would probably be better.

This was my initial thought as well, but the issue is that SRCU may or may not be
held, and so the unlock+lock would need to be conditional.  That's technically a
solvable problem, as it's possible to detect if SRCU is held, but I really don't
want to rely on kvm_vcpu.srcu_depth for anything other than proving that KVM doesn't
screw up SRCU.
