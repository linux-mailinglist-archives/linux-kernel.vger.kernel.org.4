We tried to make the support for SNP not be reliant on EFI. If EFI is 
present, then get the confidential computing blob from it. Otherwise, the 
cc blob can be supplied as part of the setup data in the Linux boot 
protocol (see find_cc_block() in arch/x86/boot/compressed/sev.c).

So I guess some of it could be moved, but I'm not sure how much.

I don't believe it is. It's using the Grub EFI bootloader to load and boot 
Linux.

Sure, I'll send you a copy in a separate email.

Thanks,
