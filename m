IIRC, s390x can have real problems if we temporarily remove a memslot. 
In case the emulation/interpretation code tries accessing guest memory 
and fails because there is no memslot describing that portion of guest RAM.

Note that resizing/merging/splitting currently shouldn't happen on 
s390x, though. But resizing of memslots might happen in the near future 
with virtio-mem in QEMU.
