Well, I think this current use case will break if we prevent the timer from
being rearmed or run again if it's not found. But as you said, the
networking folks need to confirm or deny it.

The fact that it does the sock_put() when it removes the timer makes me
think that it can be called again, and we shouldn't prevent that from
happening.

The debug code will let us know too, as it only "frees" it for freeing if
it deactivated the timer and shut it down.

Good to hear. This has been a thorn in our side as we keep hitting these
crashes in the timer code that look like a timer was freed before it
triggered.

Yeah, as someone told me recently, "If you let them play long enough without
setting out the rules, they will take advantage of everything and it will be
extremely hard to get them back in order".
