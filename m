Oh, I see what you mean now, and you're obviously correct.  Thanks for the
detailed explanation.

Ugh, I tend to forget all the details behind these decisions.  If I
remember correctly, we had to work around the fact that the cephfs client
handle directory data in a cumbersome way.  We may not have the full data
for a readdir, for example, and that has to be handled by a lookup.

In fact, my initial fix for the cephfs bug was doing just that.  It was a
single patch to ceph_atomic_open() that would simply do:

	if (IS_ENCRYPTED(dir)) {
		set_bit(CEPH_MDS_R_FSCRYPT_FILE, &req->r_req_flags);
		err =3D __fscrypt_prepare_readdir(dir);
		if (!err && !fscrypt_has_encryption_key(dir)) {
			spin_lock(&dentry->d_lock);
			dentry->d_flags |=3D DCACHE_NOKEY_NAME;
			spin_unlock(&dentry->d_lock);
		}
	}

What made me want to create a new helper was that I simply needed to call
fscrypt_get_encryption_info() to force the encryption info to be set in
the parent directory.  But this function was only accessible through
__fscrypt_prepare_readdir(), which isn't really a great function name for
what I need here.

Since __fscrypt_prepare_readdir() doesn't seem to be used anywhere else,
maybe it could be removed and fscrypt_get_encryption_info() be exported
instead?

Hmm... OK, looks like we'll need to have a look into this.  Thanks for the
heads-up.
