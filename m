The problem is if the IOVA overlaps with the physical addresses of
other devices that can be routed to via ACS redirect. As such if ACS
redirect is enabled a host IOVA could be directed to another device on
the switch instead. To prevent that we need to reserve those addresses
to avoid address space collisions.

From what I can tell it looks like the IOVA should be reserved, but I
don't see it showing up anywhere in reserved_regions. What I am
wondering is if iova_reserve_pci_windows() should be taking some steps
so that it will appear, or if  intel_iommu_get_resv_regions() needs to
have some code similar to iova_reserve_pci_windows() to get the ranges
and verify they are reserved in the IOVA.
