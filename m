That's not a technical reason. Obviously they have a use case.

This is only connecting to BPF through the API. It makes no changes to
BPF itself, so I'm not sure your NACK has jurisdiction here. Their
alternative is to to do it with an external module as the only
connections to BPF it uses is via an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() function!

Again, what is your technical reason for nacking this? It's like me
nacking a user of ftrace because I don't see a use case for it. That's
not a valid reason to issue a nack.

Why not use BPF?
