OK, I know extracting common bits is microchip new PCIe driver codes changed.
Just ignore my previous comments.
Maybe I will try to restructuring the driver code according to corporate e-mail which has been sent one year ago.

Thanks. I will check it and change my codes.

I do not run checkpatch with "--strict". I will run with it.
