I retested this series, all good. So my Tested-by tag stands.

Lorenzo, Krzysztof, Bjorn,

Let's please get this series queued for 6.4 ASAP as otherwise the rockchip EP
controller is unusable.

Also please note that working with Rick off-list, we found out that more fixes
are in fact needed for the PCI address mapping (ATU programming) on top of this
series. But the problems detected are subtle and harder to trigger. The fixes
needed involve changes to the EPC core API so we are still working on the best
way to do that. We'll work on another series on top of this one for addressing
these issues.
