emm~
I privately suppose: In the traditional way without module parameters,
this problem also exists. If the user disables remapping in guest os, the V=
MD
driver will force it to remapping mode.
What about I add the additional description in MODULE_PARM_DESC and comment=
?
As for some devices not support disable remapping,  What about changing
the param to disabae_bypass=3D0/1?
And make it clear in the description:
this parameter will only affect the disabling of bypass mode on
devices that support it.

You are right~
I will add some clarification on how to configure VMD MSI in the guest.
