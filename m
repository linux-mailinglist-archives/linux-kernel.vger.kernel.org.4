I will add some examples in the next version with the numbers I quoted in this thread.

Also, generally speaking, this series uses the thermal subsystem mostly
for board monitoring use cases, which includes applications like BMC,
and that has generated some churn because the current set of existing
drivers mainly targets in-kernel control for the running system CPU temperature monitoring.
However, even since time of thermal device tree binding conception, this limitation
was never part of the original thoughts on enhancing the thermal subsystem from
ACPI only to a more general solution.

For this reason, next iteration I will start with enhancing documentation.
I took a brief look in the existing master tree and plenty of
the existing documentation references to board monitoring have been lost
in reshuffle of thermal documentation files, including thermal device tree
bindings, which is a shame. I will recover those examples with refreshed examples.
Thermal doc has been not the prettiest anyways so it is always good to spend
some time enhancing it.
