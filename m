It is needed for correct working btrfs. David, am I right?

About just to increase the LOCKDEP_CHAINS_BITS by 1. Where should this
be done? In vanilla kernel on kernel.org? In a specific distribution?
or the user must rebuild the kernel himself? Maybe increase
LOCKDEP_CHAINS_BITS by 1 is most reliable solution, but it difficult
to distribute to end users because the meaning of using packaged
distributions is lost (user should change LOCKDEP_CHAINS_BITS in
config and rebuild the kernel by yourself).

It would be great if the chosen value would simply work always
everywhere. 30? ok! But as I understand, btrfs does not have any
guarantees for this. David, am I right?

Anyway, thank you for keeping the conversation going.
