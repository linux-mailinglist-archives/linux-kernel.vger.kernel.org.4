Besides Drew's comments and my reply a few minutes ago, here are
what I thought: I agree with you about "cpufeatures can also be soft
features" which I called cpu related features, but currently we
don't have that case in urgent, the SV48 and SV57 are extensions now
as Jessica pointed out[1], so I planed to send a v7 to apply the
alternative mechanism for SV48/SV57, and I think we still have time to
revisit the "expanding cpufeatures to cover soft features". But that
need to be addressed in another improvement series.
