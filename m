It seems to me we are all talking past each others to solve different
problems, so I am going to reset this discussion given that we are
in the merge window and I must finalise the PCI patch queue.

Patch (2/2) should be dropped IMO - I don't think the host bridge
platform device DMA mask should depend on the root port MSI cap
64/32 bit addressing - I don't think that's the right thing to do.

We should keep this discussion going for the next cycle, I will
drop patch (2/2) for the time being, sorry.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
