This depends on the previous patch you sent, so why wasn't this a patch
series?  Always send patches as a series, otherwise I would have
attempted to apply this one first and it would have failed.  You will
recieve 0-day reports about that happening over the next few days as our
testing infrastructure will also be confused.

Please fix and resend all changes you wish to have done to this driver
together.

thanks,
