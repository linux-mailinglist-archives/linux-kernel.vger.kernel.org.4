Agreed, I do not think this specific bug (cpuidle /  default_enter_idle 
leaked IRQ state) is Btrfs related. Some of the virtual machines I test 
on do not use Btrfs.

It has varied. Sometimes immediately upon boot, but can take several 
hours or a day before showing up.


Also, I forgot to say I was basing my kernels on gentoo-kernels, which 
has some patches against vanilla. Therefore I will I will compile a set 
of vanilla kernels from 6.1.37 until 6.4.2 and run them in my testing 
machines to see where the problem is happening.

This is not a fast system, so it will likely take several days. But I 
will keep you posted.

Meanwhile, if you think of any specific kernel debug options, tracing, 
etc, that I should enable, let me know

Should we change the Subject line of this email thread?

Thanks
