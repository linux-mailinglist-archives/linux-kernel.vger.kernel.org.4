Dear Supplier,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about 
the general merchandise available at your company. I recently 
came across your business and I am interested in learning more 
about the range of products you offer.

Could you please provide me with information regarding the types 
of general merchandise you carry and any unique features or 
specialties that set your products apart? Additionally, I would 
appreciate if you could share details about pricing, minimum 
order quantities, and shipping options.

Thank you for your attention to this inquiry. I look forward to 
hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
