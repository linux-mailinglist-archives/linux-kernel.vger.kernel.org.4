The difference is that for virtualization hole, there is no way but 
intercept and decode every instruction if we want the correctness. It's 
a disaster.

But for MSR virtualization, we do have an option and we don't need to 
trap every instruction. MSR interception is the designated mechanism to 
correctly and elegantly virtualize the MSR.

I never buy it. How to interpret the security? If the user wants to hide 
one feature from guest but KVM allows it when KVM does have a reasonable 
way to hide it. Does it violate the security?
