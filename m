I'm afraid that this is not going to be easy to fix at the kernel level,
we first need to tie backlight control to drm-connectors as I proposed
(and plan to implement when I can make time):

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/b61d3eeb-6213-afac-2e70-7b9791c86d2e@redhat.com/

Once that is in place we can simply make the drm-code call out to
the backlight driver and have it turn the backlight off when disabling
the output through the drm/kms interface.

Ok, lets go with the v2 which adds /sys/class/backlight support then.

I must warn you though if this does turn out to cause issues I'll have
no choice but to revert it.

I must admit I've lost track a bit of the state of v2 during this
discussion.  Can I pick up v2 as is, or were there (other) remarks
which need addressing and should I expect a v3 ?

Hmm, weird with EFI grub is just using the EFI text output protocol
so what is happening here at the grub level is actually a bug in
the firmware of the laptop(s)...

Ah ok, so I misunderstood and the problem only happens *after* grub?

Have I understood that correctly?

And this is on Fedora with the nvidia binary driver ?

The problem then likely is that the nvidia binary driver is not in
the initrd (which is by design since it may need to be rebuild on
a driver update while the kernel is kept at the same version,
so the initrd won't be rebuild).

So during the initrd there then is no kms driver to drive the
internal display.

Normally plymouth falls back to using the efifb (through simpledrm)
but that is after a pretty large timeout and I think this may not
be happening here because plymouth maybe thinks there is a kms
capable display connected to the iGPU for some reason
(maybe the extra screenpad panel ?)

As a workaround you can tell plymouth to use the simpledrm kms
device as soon as it becomes available instead of waiting for
a native kms driver. To do this add "plymouth.use-simpledrm" to
the kernel commandline. I think that this will work around
the problem.

Ok, so that answers my question from above and I should wait for a v3 :)

Hans
