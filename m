Hi Smita,

My apologies for the delay!

Makes total sense.  I like the approach of clearing only these three
bits, as you did in v1 of the patch.  I also appreciate the detailed
explanation that you've provided.  Much of your e-mail can be copy-pasted
to the commit message, in my opinion it's valuable information to any
reviewer and future reader of the commit.

Again, makes total sense.

Personally I'm fine with option [2].  If you or Bjorn prefer option [3],
I'm fine with that as well.

It doesn't hurt to additionally clear on hot-removal.
