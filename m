I see, thanks for letting me know that this is Android.

Yes, if that config is used in Android then we must fix it.

That last_trip_temp makes sense (but maybe name it last_switch_on_temp).
Please put that new field into the IPA local
struct power_allocator_params. We should store the trip temp
value there every time power_allocator_throttle() is called.
That can be called due to a write from user-space w/ a new trip point
value, so should be OK.

Lukasz
