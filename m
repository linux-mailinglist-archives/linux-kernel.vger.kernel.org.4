If you're saying this patch can't be split, can you elaborate on the
details of *why* it can't be split?

This is all true, but IIUC, the issue is about unloading IRQ
controller drivers, and this doesn't address that.  I don't have a
clear understanding of the issue, and it would be nice if a patch that
specifically added unloadability could elaborate on that.  Then we can
decide that "yes, this is a risk, and we're willing to accept it." An
argument that "tons of modules do this" totally avoids the issues of
this particular case.
