We do have this already (from
Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt):

        pci=option[,option...]  [PCI] various PCI subsystem options.

                                Some options herein operate on a specific device
                                or a set of devices (<pci_dev>). These are
                                specified in one of the following formats:

                                [<domain>:]<bus>:<dev>.<func>[/<dev>.<func>]*
                                pci:<vendor>:<device>[:<subvendor>:<subdevice>]

                                Note: the first format specifies a PCI
                                bus/device/function address which may change
                                if new hardware is inserted, if motherboard
                                firmware changes, or due to changes caused
                                by other kernel parameters. If the
                                domain is left unspecified, it is
                                taken to be zero. Optionally, a path
                                to a device through multiple device/function
                                addresses can be specified after the base
                                address (this is more robust against
                                renumbering issues).  The second format
                                selects devices using IDs from the
                                configuration space which may match multiple
                                devices in the system.
