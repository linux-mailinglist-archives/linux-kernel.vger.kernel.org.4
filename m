Yes, you are right.

tick_setup_device
     -> td->mode = TICKDEV_MODE_PERIODIC;
     -> tick_setup_periodic
         -> tick_set_periodic_handler
         -> if dev->features & CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_PERIODIC // may not support
             -> clockevents_switch_state(dev, CLOCK_EVT_STATE_PERIODIC);
         -> else
             -> clockevents_switch_state(dev, CLOCK_EVT_STATE_ONESHOT)

Are you saying that the "tick_broadcast_enter->broadcast_shutdown_local" 
path will turn off the cpu1 tick deviceï¼ˆas the broadcast)?

I think this only happens when CPU1's tick device is used as the 
broadcast device. However, the "broadcast_needs_cpu" path prevents this 
from happening, right?

Nevertheless, there is still an issue here. At this point, the broadcast 
will be in oneshot state (was_periodic is still false). The reason why 
this has not caused any serious problems may be because other CPUs will 
quickly enter idle to help refresh the broadcast.
