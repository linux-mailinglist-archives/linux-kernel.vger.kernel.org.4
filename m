The format isn't important, but especially a big series like this and
being weeks between each iteration it's difficult to follow and see
which review comments that you have chosen to implement and how. It's
almost a full review each time. Even if I see that I have acked/rewieved
a patch, if I don't remember, I have to go back to the previous version
and see if I had any comments and if you followed up on that.

The confusing thing to me is that "None" is part of the property enum
list, so the idea is that it can end up in userspace if there's a driver
error? Hmm, that won't work since TV_MODE_NONE won't be part of the
bitmask that the driver sets. So userspace reading the property ends up
with a value for which there's no enum name to match.

So usespace should be trained to know that zero for this property is a
driver error? No, not a good idea.

I think to catch a bug like this drm_atomic_connector_get_property()
should check the tv.mode value and see if it's a legal enum value and if
not it has to just pick a legal one and print an error. But I'm not sure
it's worth it to catch a bug like this. And I don't see any other enum
properties being checked for validity either before being returned to
userspace.

Based on this reasoning I think you should drop the NONE value.

Noralf.
