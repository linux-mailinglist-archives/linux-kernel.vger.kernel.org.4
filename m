Question -- on a 1k-block filesystem, are the first 1024 bytes of the
device *reserved* by ext4 for whatever bootloader crud goes in there?
Or is that space undefined in the filesystem specification?

I never did figure that out when I was writing the ondisk specification
that's in the kernel, but maybe you remember?

If those first 1024 bytes are defined to be reserved in the ondisk
format, then you could return a mapping for those bytes with the owner
code set to EXT4_FMR_OWN_UNKNOWN.

If, however, the space is undefined, then going off this statement in
the manpage:

"For example, if the low key (fsmap_head.fmh_keys[0]) is set to (8:0,
36864, 0, 0, 0), the filesystem  will  only  return  records for extents
starting at or above 36 KiB on disk."

I think the 'at or above' clause means that ext4 should not pass back
any mapping for the byte range 0-1023 on a 1k-block filesystem.

If the low key is set to (8:0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and high key is set to (8:0,
1023, 0, 0, 0) then ext4 shouldn't return any mapping at all, because
there's no space usage defined for that region of the disk.

If the low key is set to (8:0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and high key is set to all
ones, then ext4 can return mappings for the primary superblock at offset
1024.
