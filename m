What Steve said.

I'll also add an administrative note, we just moved upstream Linux
audit development to a new mailing list, audit@vger.kernel.org, please
use that in future patch submissions.  As a positive, it's a fully
open list so you won't run into moderation delays/notifications/etc.

Fan, would it be reasonable to list the properties which caused the
access denial?  That seems like it might be more helpful than the
specific rule, or am I missing something?

Not all LSMs which load policy have that information; as an example,
SELinux doesn't have the concept of a policy name or version.  The
SELinux policy version you might see in the kernel sources refers to
the policy format version and has no bearing on the actual policy
content beyond that dictated by the format.

If additional information is required by IPE, perhaps an auxiliary IPE
policy load record could be created with those additional fields.

If it is just switching from one previously loaded policy to another,
it seems like MAC_CONFIG_CHANGE might be the best choice.
