I'm bit confused which comment you are speaking about but
bfq_completed_request() gets called only from bfq_finish_requeue_request()
and the request itself still holds a reference to bfqq. Only later in
bfq_finish_requeue_request() when we do:

	bfqq_request_freed(bfqq);
	bfq_put_queue(bfqq);

bfqq can get freed.
