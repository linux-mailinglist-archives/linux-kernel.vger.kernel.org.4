Why would you need PCIe gen1 speed during suspend?

These numbers are already somewhat random as, for example, the vendor
driver is requesting 500 kBps (800 peak) during runtime, while we are
now requesting five times that during suspend (the vendor driver gets a
away with 0).

Sure, this indicates that the interconnect driver is broken and we
should indeed be using values that at least makes some sense (and
eventually fix the interconnect driver).

Just not sure that you need to request that much bandwidth during
suspend (e.g. for just a couple of register accesses).
