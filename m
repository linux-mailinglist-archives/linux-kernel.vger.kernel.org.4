Yes, for the uImage.FIT to be usable for the partition parser it has
to be page-aligned.

There is a check which makes sure that this is the case:
> +	/* uImage.FIT should be aligned to page boundaries */
> +	if (fit_start_sector % (1 << (PAGE_SHIFT - SECTOR_SHIFT)))

In case of mtdblock or ubiblock devices, the image always starts at
offset 0, so this is never a problem.
In case of the image being stored in a GPT partition, one has to make
sure that the start sector of the partition is page aligned, otherwise
the above check will fail and the partition parser will bail out.
