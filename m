But it should be an internal implementation detail, I don't think we
want the external interface tied to vmalloc -

So yes, text_poke() doesn't work on all architectures, and we need a
fallback.

But if the fallback needs to go the unprotect/protect route, I think we
need to put that in the helper, and not expose it. Part of what people
are wanting is to limit or eliminate pages that are RWX, so we
definitely shouldn't be creating new interfaces to flipping page
permissions: that should be pushed down to as low a level as possible.

E.g., with my jitalloc_update(), a more complete version would look like

void jitalloc_update(void *dst, void *src, size_t len)
{
	if (text_poke_available) {
		text_poke(...);
	} else {
		unprotect();
		memcpy();
		protect();
	}
}

See? We provide a simpler, safer interface, and this also lets us handle
multiple threads racing to update/flip permissions on the same page in a
single place (e.g. with sticking a lock somewhere in the jitalloc
structures).

Or ideally, we'd have a kmap_local() variant that actually creates a new
mapping on all architectures, and we'd just use that to do the update
without any arch-dependent code - if we get that, having this helper
means we'll only have to change a single place later.

Yeah, I know what it feels like to get yanked around by different
reviewers who see and join in the discussion at different times. Sorry :)

Having a rational/design doc in the header file would help a _lot_.

This must have been part of the previous discussion since you started
with execmem_alloc(), but I did scan through that and I'm still not
seeing the justification for why this needs to handle non-text
allocations.

If I had to hazard a guess it would be because of tglx wanting to solve
tlb fragmentation for modules, but to me that doesn't sound like a good
enough reason and it looks like we're ending up with a messy "try to be
all things to all people" interface as a result :/

Do we _really_ need that?

Mike was just saying at LSF that direct map fragmentation turned out to
be a non issue for performance for non-text, so maybe we don't.

Also - module_memory_fill_type(), module_memory_invalidate_type() - I
know these are for BPF, but could you explain why we need them in the
external interface here? Could they perhaps be small helpers in the bpf
code that use something like jitalloc_update()?

Let's see if we can get tglx to chime in again, since he was pretty
vocal in the last discussion.

It's also good practice to try to summarize all the relevant "whys" from
the discussion that went into a feature and put that in at least the
commit message - or even better, header file comments.

Also, organization: the module code is a huge mess, let's _please_ do
split this out and think about organization a bit more, not add to the
mess :)

Cheers,
Kent
