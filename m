Yes that should be the case.  I think this allows shmem page cache to be
still collapse-able into a thp even if some vma has uffd-wp registered. On
a uffd-wp enabled VMA it keeps using pte mappings, while other vmas that
map the same page can map it as thp.

Right, my guess is we're purely lucky because currently khugepaged (or the
new MADV_COLLAPSE) merge file thps lazily so we only drop ptes/pmd rather
than installing the new pmd.

To minor mode it means old pte holes will keep being holes (with pmd entry
dropped as a whole, though). It's just that there can be present ptes
becoming holes after collapsed so there can be false positives after the
collapsing of the page cache.  Should not be a problem for minor mode as
long as holes are not populated without being noticed.  After all, minor
mode is a tricky feature, and it's prone to false positives from the 1st
day because file ptes can get lost for a lot of reasons..

If checking userfaultfd_armed() here it'll also work I think, but it won't
help much with e.g. minor mode because at this stage we've already freezed
all existing small pages and unmapped all the ptes anyway, so false
positive is not avoidable anyway for minor mode.  Meanwhile it'll stop the
chance of processes to use shm thp mappings as long as they have a sharer
vma that registered with any type of uffd.  So checking missing here only
seems to be a good choice.
