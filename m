Apologies, but which convention?

Actually, this is not for making the kernel know about bootloaders. This 
is dealing with the challenge created when the preamble was split for 
efi-stub, and similar use cases, where what sets up the preamble, ie. 
the bootloader, is separate from what invokes the dynamic launch, ie. 
the DLE handler. The reality is that even in the simplest implementation 
of the DLE handler, a remnant of GRUB for call back from efi-stub, there 
is information that is needed to cross the gap.

We wrote the TrenchBoot Secure Launch general spec [1] with as much 
forethought as possible for the target environments. Specifically, the 
desire is to have a common approach for x86 (Intel and AMD), Arm, and 
perhaps down the road the POWER arch. In particular, I do not believe 
there is anything in the Arm DRTM beta spec that prohibits a mixed 32/64 
bit environment. In the end it is better to for the spec to be safe for 
those environments then having to make changes to the spec later down 
the road.
