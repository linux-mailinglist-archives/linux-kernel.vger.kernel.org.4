Sorry for the late reply.  I just realised that my question from a few days
ago has yet to make it to the mailing list. Again, I apologise for keeping
you waiting.


Nevertheless, I was asking whether there would be any "Fixes:" tags to add
and if we should let the stable maintainers know since this fixes an issue
that might be worth back-porting to older kernels.


Let me know.  Otherwise, everything looks good!  Thank you a lot!
