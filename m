It seems it wasn't fully tested, the code compiles and kernel module loads,
but further functionality didn't seem to have been tested
(e.g., lspci, and with the pcitest tool and pci_endpoit_test_driver).

Thank you, I will prepare the changes and add them to the next iteration
with changes from other comments that may arise.

I will. I tried to split everything into the function it was related to, bu=
t I
now understand I should split even more so that the commit message
and changes are more tightly linked.

Does this mean I should refer to the commit cf590b078391
("PCI: rockchip: Add EP driver for Rockchip PCIe controller") ?
Because it wasn't working in the first place ?

I agree.

Thank you for all the pointers, I'll take them into account for the
next iteration. This is the first time I actually submitted a series of
patches to the LKML so it's all relatively new to me.
