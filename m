RID?

I don't think the code in this series has any chance of actually
working.  There is a lot of state associated with a NVMe subsystem,
controller and namespace, such as the serial number, subsystem NQN,
namespace uniqueue identifiers, Get/Set features state, pending AENs,
log page content.  Just migrating from one device to another without
capturing all this has no chance of actually working.

I've not seen anyone from Intel actually contributing to the live
migration TPAR, which is almost two month old by now.
