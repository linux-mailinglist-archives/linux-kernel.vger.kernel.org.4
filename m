Yes, I'm really grateful to Mauro for adapting an earlier version of
libtraceevent, although it was just cut and pasted into rasdaemon. But it
is time to use the official library, which had a bit of changes to the
interface.

Definitely.

As long as the code can handle a field removed or renamed. It allows the
application to check if it is there or not.

You can always add a trace event on top of an existing trace event with a
"custom" trace event.

See https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/samples/trace_events/trace_custom_sched.h

Also, take a look at some of the code that is coming with libtracefs:

  https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-trace-devel/list/?series=688772

 (Note, it's not there just yet)

Basically you can just do:

	instance = tracefs_instance_create(TOOL_NAME);

	for (i = 0; i < nr_cpus; i++) {
		tcpus[i] = tracefs_cpu_open(instance, i, false);

And then you can read from the raw trace buffers;

	/* Read all "ras" events */
	tep = tracefs_local_events_system(NULL, "ras");

	/* Note pevent was renamed to tep */

	/* I need to write up kbuffer man pages :-/ */
	kbuf = kbuffer_alloc(sizeof(long) == 8, !tep_is_bigendian());

	/* I guess you want to retrieve any data */
	tracefs_instance_file_write(instance, "buffer_percent", "0");

	buf = malloc(tracefs_cpu_read_size(tcpu));

	/* false means block until there's data */
	tracefs_cpu_read(tcpus[i], buf, false);

	struct tep_record *record;
	unsigned long long ts;

	/* Load the read raw data into the kbuffer parser */
	kbuffer_load_subbuffer(kbuf, buf);

	for (;;) {
		record.data = kbuffer_read_event(kbuf, &ts);
		if (!record.data)
			break;
		record.ts = ts;

		process(tep, record);

		kbuffer_next_event(kbuf, NULL);

		/* There's tracefs iterators that do this too, but I'm
		 * working on adding more features to them. */
	}


static void process(struct tep_handle *tep, struct tep_record *record)
{
	static struct tep_event *mc_event;
	static struct tep_event *aer_event;
	[..]
	static struct trace_seq s;
	struct tep_event *event;
	unsigned long long val;

	/* Initialize the static events to use them for data */
	if (!mc_event) {
		trace_seq_init(&s);
		mc_event = tep_find_event_by_name(tep, "ras", "mc_event");
		/* Do error checking? */
		aer_event = tep_find_event_by_name(tep, "ras", "aer_event");
		[..]
	}

	/* Remove any previous strings in s. */
	trace_seq_reset(&s);

	event = tep_find_event_by_record(tep, record);
	if (event->id == mc_event->id) {
		tep_get_field_val(&s, event, "address", record, &val, 0);
		[..]
	}
}


With libtracefs and libtraceevent, process trace events is so much easier
than it use to be!
