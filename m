Should be KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID.

> +Co-Posting Tests
> +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> +KVM selftests that are associated with KVM changes, e.g. regression tests for
> +bug fixes, should be posted along with the KVM changes as a single series.
> +
> +KVM-unit-tests should *always* be posted separately.  Tools, e.g. b4 am, don't
> +know that KVM-unit-tests is a separate repository and get confused when patches
> +in a series apply on different trees.  To tie KVM-unit-tests patches back to
> +KVM patches, first post the KVM changes and then provide a lore Link: to the
> +KVM patch/series in the KVM-unit-tests patch(es).
> +
> +Notifications
> +-------------
> +When a patch/series is officially accepted, a notification email will be sent
> +in reply to the original posting (cover letter for multi-patch series).  The
> +notification will include the tree and topic branch, along with the SHA1s of
> +the commits of applied patches.
> +
> +If a subset of patches is applied, this will be clearly stated in the
> +notification.  Unless stated otherwise, it's implied that any patches in the
> +series that were not accepted need more work and should be submitted in a new
> +version.
> +
> +If for some reason a patch is dropped after officially being accepted, a reply
> +will be sent to the notification email explaining why the patch was dropped, as
> +well as the next steps.

> +SHA1 Stability
> +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> +SHA1s are not 100% guaranteed to be stable until they land in Linus' tree!  A
> +SHA1 is *usually* stable once a notification has been sent, but things happen.
> +In most cases, an update to the notification email be provided if an applied
> +patch's SHA1 changes.  However, in some scenarios, e.g. if all KVM x86 branches
> +need to be rebased, individual notifications will not be given.

> +Vulnerabilities
> +---------------
> +Bugs that can be exploited by the guest to attack the host (kernel or
> +userspace), or that can be exploited by a nested VM to *its* host (L2 attacking
> +L1), are of particular interest to KVM.  Please follow the protocol for
> +:ref:`securitybugs` if you suspect a bug can lead to an escape, data leak, etc.
