Are XHCI, USB-C, and the AMD USB4 router just examples?  I assume the
same issue could happen with non-XHCI and non-AMD devices, too?

I assume the problem has something to do with PME_Support and some
device being put in a power state where it cannot generate or forward
PME messages?  I think the PCIe protocol details would be helpful
here.

I'm not sure what the critical device is here.  9d26d3a8f1b0 and the
current pci_bridge_d3_possible() are not specific to Root Ports.  The
PCIe protocol details would probably clear this up.

platform_pci_power_manageable() tests adev->flags.power_manageable,
which is set by acpi_bus_get_power_flags() when a device has _PS0 or
_PR0.

So I don't know what's relevant out of _PRW, _S0W, _PS0, _PR0, but
this sentence doesn't seem to match the code.

Is this talking about D3hot or D3cold or both?  If we can make this
explicit, it will help me out.  It's probably obvious to power
experts, but I'm not one.
