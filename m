Being able to specify "ima_appraise=" on the boot command line requires
IMA_APPRAISE_BOOTPARAM to be configured.  Even when specified, if the
system is booted with secure-boot mode enabled, it also cannot be
modified.   With the ability of randomly enabling/disabling LSMs, these
protections are useless.

IMA initialization is deferred to late_initcall to allow the TPM to
finish initializing.  It doesn't make a difference when the iint_cache
is initialized.  It just needs to be prior to IMA/EVM initializiation.

There are specific tests in LTP, kselftests, and ima-evm-utils, but
they are incomplete.
