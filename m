Thanks for your question. The SGX EPC memory is a global shared
resource that can be over committed. The SGX EPC controller should be
used similarly to the normal memory controller. Normally when there is
pressure on EPC memory, the reclaimer thread will write out pages from
EPC memory to a backing RAM that is allocated per enclave. It is
possible currently for even a single enclave to force all the other
enclaves to have their epc pages written to backing RAM by allocating
all the available system EPC memory. This can cause performance issues
for the enclaves when they have to fault to load pages page in.

sgx_epc.high value will help control the EPC usage of the cgroup. The
sgx reclaimer will use this value to prevent the total EPC usage of a
cgroup from exceeding this value (best effort). This way, if a system
administrator would like to try to prevent single enclaves, or groups
of enclaves from allocating all of the EPC memory and causing
performance issues for the other enclaves on the system, they can set
this limit. sgx_epc.max can be used to set a hard limit, which will
cause an enclave to get all it's used pages zapped and it will
effectively be killed until it is rebuilt by the owning sgx
application. sgx_epc.low can be used to (best effort) try to ensure
that some minimum amount of EPC pages are protected for enclaves in a
particular cgroup. This can be useful for preventing evictions and thus
performance issues due to faults.

I hope this answers your question.

Thanks,
Kristen
