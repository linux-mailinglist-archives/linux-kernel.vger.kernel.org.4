Since I have not seen any objections so far, I am removing RFC from
patch subject and resending after rebasing over current linux-next tag.
Have also included "Reviewed-by" tag from Paul for Patch-1.

================================================
    Original cover letter
================================================
This changeset intends to reduce the logging due to csdlock_debug=1, when a CSD
hang is detected by multiple CPUs or for a duartion spanning multiple 
csd_lock_timeout units or both.

csdlock_debug=1 is very useful feature due to its low overhead and suitability
for production systems.
It can help detecting issues such as CPU(s) not coming out of idle even
after getting IPIs or CPU(s) not handling IPIs because they have irq
disabled for long or IPIs getting lost etc.

The usual overhead of csdlock_debug=1 is minimal but for large scale systems
sometimes the dump_stack and backtrace NMIs emanating from CSD hang detection,
simply bog down the system and create altogether different problem on its own.

For example say there is a 8 socket system with 448 CPUs. Out of these 448
CPUs, 400+ CPUs issued smp_call_function_single (almost at same time) to
CPU 10 and the servicing of those IPIs got delayed for 10+ secs.
Now each of these 400+ CPUs will detect csd hang and dump their current
call stack and issue backtrace NMI to CPU 10 and thus CPU 10 needs to
handle these 400+ NMIs, besides what it was doing at that point of time.
Further since IPI handling at CPU 10 got delayed by 10+ secs, each of
these 400+ CPUs will continue with the hang detection and dump their
call stack again (even though they have not changed context since last
dump_stack.)

This excessive logging bogs down the system and sometimes obfuscates/overwrites
other useful log messages.

Below I have included log snipptes from a 8 CPU system, just to show logging aspect.
Full log from a 448 CPUs will be too big to include here.
In the below snippet(s) 7 out of 8 CPUs sent IPI to one remaining
CPU(#3) almost at the same time but the destination CPU could not serve these
IPIs timely giving rise to CSD hang detection at each CPU and NMI being 
sent from each CPU. We can see that destination CPU is handling backtrace NMI
multiple times and source CPUs are dumping their call stacks multiple times as well.

I have kept the changes as RFC as one may argue that if we are bothered
about logs we may simply not use csdlock_debug but intention here is to
address/optimize the logging behaviour so that the feature can be used
for other bug detections.
===============================================

Imran Khan (2):
  smp: Reduce logging due to dump_stack of CSD waiters.
  smp: Reduce NMI traffic from CSD waiters to CSD destination.
