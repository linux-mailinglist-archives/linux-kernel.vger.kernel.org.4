Good changelog.  This patch is doing *one* thing.

I'm always skeptical that it's a good idea to take this in code:

	tdmr->base

and make it this:

	tdmr_start(tdmr)

because the helper is *LESS* compact than the open-coded form!  I hope
I'm proven wrong.

FWIW, I think it's probably a bad idea to have 'struct tdmr_info *'
types floating around since:

	tmdr_info_array[0]

works, but:

	tmdr_info_array[1]

will blow up in your face.  It would almost make sense to have

struct tdmr_info_list {
	struct tdmr_info *first_tdmr;
}

and then pass around pointers to the 'struct tdmr_info_list'.  Maybe
that's overkill, but it is kinda silly to call something an array if []
doesn't work on it.

This seems like it might tend to under-utilize TDMRs.  I'm sure this is
done for simplicity, but is it OK?  Why is it OK?  How are you sure this
won't bite us later?

Nit: a little vertical alignment can make this much more readable:

		start = TDMR_ALIGN_DOWN(tmb->start_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT);
		end   = TDMR_ALIGN_UP  (tmb->end_pfn   << PAGE_SHIFT);

Again, we have a comment over a if() block that describes what the
individual steps in the block do.  *Plus* each individual step is
*ALREADY* commented.  What purpose does this comment serve?

Seems like a positive return value could be the number of populated
TDMRs.  That would get rid of the int* argument.

OK, so something else allocated the 'tdmr_array' and it's being passed
in here to fill it out.  "construct" and "create" are both near synonyms
for "allocate", which isn't even being done here.

We want something here that will make it clear that this function is
taking an already populated list of TDMRs and filling it out.
"fill_tmdrs()" seems like it might be a better choice.

This is also a place where better words can help.  If the function is
called "construct", then there's *ZERO* value in using the same word in
the comment.  Using a word that is a close synonym but that can contrast
it with something different would be really nice, say:

This is also a place where the calling convention can be used to add
clarity.  If you implicitly use a global variable, you have to explain
that.  But, if you pass *in* a variable, it's a lot more clear.

Take this, for instance:

/*
 * Take the memory referenced in @tdx_memlist and populate the
 * preallocated @tmdr_array, following all the special alignment
 * and size rules for TDMR.
 */
static int fill_out_tdmrs(struct list_head *tdx_memlist,
			  struct tdmr_info *tdmr_array)
{
...

That's 100% crystal clear about what's going on.  You know what the
inputs are and the outputs.  You also know why this is even necessary.
It's implied a bit, but it's because TDMRs have special rules about
size/alignment and tdx_memlists do not.
