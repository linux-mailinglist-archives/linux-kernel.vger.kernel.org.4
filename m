vmcs_config.nested never becomes out-of-date, it's read-only after __init (not
currently marked as such, that will be remedied soon).

The auditing performed by KVM is purely to guard against userspace enabling
features that KVM doesn't support.  KVM is not responsible for ensuring that the
vCPU's CPUID model match the VMX MSR model.

An example would be if userspace loaded the VMX MSRs with a default model, and
then enabled features one-by-one.  In practice this doesn't happen because it's
more performant to gather all features and do a single KVM_SET_MSRS, but it's a
legitimate approach that KVM should allow.

That's a stale comment, see the very next commit, 8805875aa473 ("Revert "KVM: nVMX:
Do not expose MPX VMX controls when guest MPX disabled""), as well as the slightly
later commit 9389d5774aca ("Revert "KVM: nVMX: Expose load IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL
VM-{Entry,Exit} control"").

As above, the comment is stale, KVM should not manipulate the VMX MSRs in response
to guest CPUID changes.  The one exception to this is reserved CR0/CR4 bits.  We
discussed quirking that behavior, but ultimately decided not to because (a) no
userspace actually cares and and (b) KVM would effectively need to make up behavior
if userspace allowed the guest to load CR4 bits via VM-Enter or VM-Exit that are
disallowed by CPUID, e.g. L1 could end up running with a CR4 that is supposed to
be impossible according to CPUID.

KVM already does that in upstream (with further sanitization).  See commit
bcdf201f8a4d ("KVM: nVMX: Use sanitized allowed-1 bits for VMX control MSRs").

This can't be completely removed, though unless I'm missing something, it can and
should be shifted to the sanitization code, e.g.

This one is still required.  KVM never enables VMFUNC for itself, i.e. it won't
be set in KVM's VMCS configuration.
