With the logic in the CCF conversion patch set for these rates the 24MHz
xtal mux input would be used, creating exactly the requested rates.
So I see no difference here. What I don't know is whether power
consumption may be higher with a higher input rate, or whether quality
of the mux parent clocks differs.
