Yes, sorry akida is the project prefix I am currently working on.
It is simply a prefix for the symbol export to be different than mainline,
don't take it into account.

Alright, on my side I have a board using this FPGA implementation and it
indeed doesn't work as is.

This could be a nice idea but it doesn't work, non-existent channels seems =
to
be writable. The datasheet of the HDMA IP doesn't have any register to find=
 out
the maximum existent channel.=20
As there is no way to know this, the dw_hdma_v0_core_ch_count will simply
return HDMA_V0_MAX_NR_CH.
Cai how does it works on your side? does the ch_en register already enabled=
 by
the implementation?
