The bpf_send_singal, bpf_send_singal_thread and bpf_override_return
is similar to bpf_write_user and can affect userspace processes.
Thus, these three helpers should also be restricted by security lockdown.

Thanks for you reply.

I have studied this problem for months. I would like to give more details to
 clarify why these two helpers can break the INTEGRITY and should be lockdown.

First, this helpers are only for eBPF tracing programs. LSM-bpf and seccomp do 
not need them. The documents say the two functions are experimental. 
Now the eBPF products (e.g., Cillium, Falco) seldom use them but the evil eBPF 
can abuse them.

Second, override_return is similar to bpf_write_user can defintely break the 
INTEGRITY by altering other processes' system call or kernel functions 
(KProbe)'s return code.

Yes, the solution is for restricting eBPF in container. But a fine-gained access 
control is required, such as assigning different eBPF privilege to various containers, 
rather than just disable eBPF in a container. 
 
The mechanisms you mententioned do not properly sovle the problem.
sysctl can only disable the unprivielge
users to access eBPF via the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled flag. The untrusted eBPF
are installed by privielge users inside a container but can harm the whole system and 
other shared-kernel containers.
seccomp also can only disable the bpf system call to totally disable eBPF while we may 
need to selectively enable the benign features of eBPF and disallow the offensive features
which may be abused.
LSM + bpf LSM can implement this functionality. However, it is difficult to identify 
a process from a container [1] as at many LSM hooks, we can only get a process's pid and
 name which can be forged by the mailicous program. A correct way is to use the inode number
 to set policy for benign processes. Moreover, the LSM bpf's overhead is unacceptable.

The bpf_send_singal is different to any other signal sending functions as it 
enables a eBPF tracing program from a container to kill any processes 
(even the privielge proceess) of the host or other containers. 
Supervisors and seccomp can only kill its child process. Other signal sending 
do not need to be restricted as they can not be used inside a container to kill 
any processes outside of a container.

We will try to implement alternative mechanisms for constrained eBPF 
features only since the LSM-bpf have shortages in both flexibility and
 performance. 

This patch is only for blocking the offensive features of eBPF and avoiding themÂ 
affecting the INTEGRITY of the container, given that the evil eBPF can abuse these
helpers to affect any processes running in inside or outside of the container, 
sharing the same kernel.
