Yup, he did. For the record, this is what he wrote:

```
it [a shallow clone] is pretty expensive on the server side, but it is
only really a problem when a bunch of shallow clones are performed at
once (e.g. when a CI farm does it across 50 nodes or something). When
that happens, it overwhelms the server.

If an actual human being does a single shallow clone it's not a big deal.
```

Yeah, that's something I have in mind already. But seems it's not much
of a problem, as one apparently can access older versions (including
tags) by deepening a shallow clone with a command like "git fetch origin
--shallow-exclude=v5.19" these days.

Ciao, Thorsten
