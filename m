Yes, minus the "from root" restriction.  When a page table (call it "branch" to
continue the analogy) PTE has been zapped/blocked ("pruned"), KVM just needs to
wait for all potential readers to go away.  That guarantee is provided by RCU;
software walkers, i.e. KVM itself, are required to hold RCU, and hardware walkers,
i.e. vCPUs running in the guest, are protected by proxy as the zapper ("arborist"?)
is required to hold RCU until all running vCPUs have been kicked.

In other words, once the PTE is zapped/blocked (branch is pruned), it's completely
removed from the paging tree and no other tasks can access the branch (page table
and its children).  I.e. the only remaining reference to the branch is the pointer
handed to the RCU callback.  That means the RCU callback has exclusive access to the
branch, i.e. can operate as if it were holding mmu_lock for write.  Furthermore, the
RCU callback also doesn't need to flush TLBs because that was again done when
pruning the branch.

It's the same idea that KVM already uses for root SPs, the only difference is how
KVM determines that there is exactly one entity that holds a reference to the SP.

Oh, I didn't mean to suggest KVM skip TDH.MEM.RANGE.BLOCK for children, I simply
forgot that all S-EPT entries need to be blocked before they can be removed.

Ah, sorry, that was unclear.  By "invoke the KVM TDX hook" I didn't mean "do the
SEAMCALL", I meant KVM TDX could do its own manipulation of the KVM-managed SPTEs
before the common/standard flow.  E.g. something like:

	if (kvm_x86_ops.set_private_spte && private)
		r = static_call(kvm_x86_set_private_spte(...)
	else
		r = try_cmpxchg64(...) ? 0 : -EBUSY;

so that the common code doesn't need to do, or even be aware of, the freezing.
Then I think we just need another hook in handle_removed_pt(), or maybe in what
is currently __kvm_tdp_mmu_write_spte()?

I.e. fully replace the "write" operations in the TDP MMU instead of trying to
smush S-EPT's requirements into the common path.
