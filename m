The secure state of the GIC is being re-initialized coming out of 
suspend to DRAM since the chip lost its state, in fact we configure it 
the same as we did during cold boot and then the firmware goes on 
re-initializing the various secure interrupts it uses.

The non-secure state was not dealt with by the firmware, which prompted 
me to mimicking what the GICv2 driver does since there is an expectation 
from Linux that interrupts will be saved/restored.

I suppose it is so obvious that saving/restoring must happen by trusted 
firmware that there is no point in putting that in BIG CAPITAL WORDS for 
people to know about it.

As you may or may not remember we have our own ARM Trusted Firmware for 
better of for worse, I will put the code to save and restore the 
registers there. Thanks!
