Intel puts mappings into three categories, which for non-root mode equates to:

  linear         == GVA => GPA
  guest-physical == GPA => HPA
  combined       == GVA => HPA

and essentially the categories that consume the GVA are tagged with the VPID
(linear and combined), and categories that consume the GPA are tagged with the
EPTP address (guest-physical and combined).

> Are these the mapping which happen when e.g. vCPU has paging disabled?

No, these mappings can be created at all times.  Even with CR0.PG=1, the guest
can generate GPAs without going through a GVA=>GPA translation, e.g. the page tables
themselves, RTIT (Intel PT) addresses, etc...  And even for combined/full
translations, the CPU can insert TLB entries for just the GPA=>HPA part.

E.g. when a page is allocated by/for userspace, the kernel will zero the page using
the kernel's direct map, but userspace will access the page via a different GVA.
I.e. the guest effectively aliases GPA(x) with GVA(k) and GVA(u).  By inserting
the GPA(x) => HPA(y) into the TLB, when guest userspace access GVA(u), the CPU
encounters a TLB miss on GVA(u) => GPA(x), but gets a TLB hit on GPA(x) => HPA(y).

Separating EPT flushes from VPID (and PCID) flushes allows the CPU to retain
the partial TLB entries, e.g. a host change in the EPT tables will result in the
guest-physical and combined mappings being invalidated, but linear mappings can
be kept.

I'm 99% certain AMD also caches partial entries, e.g. see the blurb on INVLPGA
not affecting NPT translations, AMD just doesn't provide a way for the host to
flush _only_ NPT translations.  Maybe the performance benefits weren't significant
enough to justify the extra complexity?

Move it to svm_flush_tlb_current(), because the justification is that on SVM,
flushing "current" TLB entries also flushes "guest" TLB entries due to the more
coarse-grained ASID-based TLB flush.  E.g.

I think even long term, purging Hyper-V's FIFO in svm_flush_tlb_current() is the
correct/desired behavior.  This doesn't really have anything to do with nSVM,
it's all about SVM not providing a way to flush only NPT entries.
