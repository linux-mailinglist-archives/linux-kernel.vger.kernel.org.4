Wrap closer to 75 chars, and please try to be consistent in how your format
things like changelogs and comments.  It's jarring as a reader when the wrap
column is constantly changing.

Please combine the introduction, usage, and implementation of the hew kvm_x86_ops,
i.e. introduce and use the ops in this patch.  It's extremely difficult to review
the common x86 code that uses the ops without seeing how they're implemented in
SVM.  I believe the overall size/scope of the patch can be kept reasonable by
introducing some of the common changes in advance of the new ops, e.g. tweaking
the KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS flow.

I can't tell if this is saying "SVM doesn't allow intercepting virtual NMIs", or
"KVM never enables virtual NMI interception".

State what KVM does, don't describe the effects.  E.g. "Disable vNMI while running
L2".  When a changelog describes the effects, it's unclear whether the effects are
new behavior introduced by the patch, hardware behavior, etc...

Can you elaborate on why not?  It's not obvious to me that the code will end up
more complex, and oftentimes omitting code increases the cognitive load on readers,
i.e. makes things more complex in a way.  vNMI is mutually exclusive with NMI
passthrough, i.e. KVM doesn't need to handle NMI passthrough and vNMI simultaneously.

Please avoid save/restore names.  KVM (selftests in particular) uses save/restore
to refer to a saving and restoring state across a migration.  "sync" is probably
the best option, or just open code the flows.

This is wrong.  V_NMI_PENDING is bit 11, i.e. the bitwise-AND does not yield a
boolean value and will increment nmi_pending by 2048 instead of by 1.

	if (vmcb01->control.int_ctl & V_NMI_PENDING)
		svm->vcpu.arch.nmi_pending++;

And this needs a KVM_REQ_EVENT to ensure KVM processes the newly pending NMI.

As proposed, this needs to clear nmi_masked to avoid false positives.  The better
approach is to not have any open coded accesses to svm->nmi_masked outside of
flows that specifically need to deal with vNMI logic.

E.g. svm_enable_nmi_window() reads the raw nmi_masked.

Curly braces on all paths if any path needs 'em.

Please honor the soft limit and avoid pronouns.  There's also no need to put the
blurb in parantheses on its own line.

As for the code, I believe there are bugs.  Pulling in the context...

	if (svm->nmi_masked && !svm->awaiting_iret_completion)
		return; /* IRET will cause a vm exit */

Checking nmi_masked is wrong, this should use the helper.  Even if this code can
only be reached on error, it should still try its best to not make things worse.

	if (!gif_set(svm)) {
		if (vgif)
			svm_set_intercept(svm, INTERCEPT_STGI);
		return; /* STGI will cause a vm exit */
	}

	/*
	 * Something prevents NMI from been injected. Single step over possible
	 * problem (IRET or exception injection or interrupt shadow)
	 *
	 * With vNMI we should never need an NMI window
	 * (we can always inject vNMI either by setting VNMI_PENDING or by EVENTINJ)
	 */
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(is_vnmi_enabled(svm)))
		return;

This is flawed, where "this" means handling of NMI windows when vNMI is enabled.

IIUC, if there are back-to-back NMIs, the intent is to set V_NMI for one and
inject the other.  I believe there are multiple bugs svm_inject_nmi().  The one
that's definitely a bug is setting svm->nmi_masked.  The other suspected bug,
which is related to the above WARN, is setting the IRET intercept.  The resulting
IRET interception will set awaiting_iret_completion, and then the above WARN is
reachable (even if the masking check is fixed).

I don't think KVM needs to ever intercept IRET.  One NMI gets injected, and the
other is sitting in INT_CTL.V_NMI_PENDING, i.e. there's no need for KVM to regain
control.  If another NMI comes along before V_NMI_PENDING is handled, it will
either get injected or dropped.

So I _think_ KVM can skip the intercept code when injecting an NMI, and this WARN
can be hoisted to the top of svm_enable_nmi_window(), because as stated above, KVM
should never need to request an NMI window.

Last thought, unless there's something that will obviously break, it's probably
better to WARN and continue than to bail.  I.e. do the single-step and hope for
the best.  Bailing at this point doesn't seem like it would help.

I would rather check the current VMCB.  I don't see any value in hardcoding the
"KVM doesn't support vNMI in L2" in multiple places.  And I find the above comment
about "L1's vNMI is inhibited" confusing.  vNMI isn't inhibited/blocked, KVM just
doesn't utilize vNMI while L2 is active (IIUC, as proposed).
