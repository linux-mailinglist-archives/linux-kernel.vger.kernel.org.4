>> +======================
>> +Secure Launch Overview
>> +======================
>> +
>> +Overview
>> +========
>> +
>> +Prior to the start of the TrenchBoot project, the only active Open Source
>> +project supporting dynamic launch was Intel's tboot project to support their
>> +implementation of dynamic launch known as Intel Trusted eXecution Technology
>> +(TXT). The approach taken by tboot was to provide an exokernel that could
>> +handle the launch protocol implemented by Intel's special loader, the SINIT
>> +Authenticated Code Module (ACM [2]_) and remained in memory to manage the SMX
>> +CPU mode that a dynamic launch would put a system. While it is not precluded
>> +from being used for doing a late launch, tboot's primary use case was to be
>> +used as an early launch solution. As a result the TrenchBoot project started
>> +the development of Secure Launch kernel feature to provide a more generalized
>> +approach. The focus of the effort is twofold, the first is to make the Linux
>> +kernel directly aware of the launch protocol used by Intel, AMD/Hygon, Arm, and
>> +potentially OpenPOWER. The second is to make the Linux kernel be able to
>> +initiate a dynamic launch. It is through this approach that the Secure Launch
>> +kernel feature creates a basis for the Linux kernel to be used in a variety of
>> +dynamic launch use cases.
>> +
>> +.. note::
>> +    A quick note on terminology. The larger open source project itself is
>> +    called TrenchBoot, which is hosted on GitHub (links below). The kernel
>> +    feature enabling the use of the x86 technology is referred to as "Secure
>> +    Launch" within the kernel code.
>> +
>> +Goals
>> +=====
>> +
>> +The first use case that the TrenchBoot project focused on was the ability for
>> +the Linux kernel to be started by a dynamic launch, in particular as part of an
>> +early launch sequence. In this case the dynamic launch will be initiated by any
>> +boot loader with associated support added to it, for example the first targeted
>> +boot loader in this case was GRUB2. An integral part of establishing a
>> +measurement-based launch integrity involves measuring everything that is
>> +intended to be executed (kernel image, initrd, etc) and everything that will
>> +configure that kernel to execute (command line, boot params, etc). Then storing
>> +those measurements in a protected manner. Both the Intel and AMD dynamic launch
>> +implementations leverage the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to store those
>> +measurements. The TPM itself has been designed such that a dynamic launch
>> +unlocks a specific set of Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) for holding
>> +measurement taken during the dynamic launch.  These are referred to as the DRTM
>> +PCRs, PCRs 17-22. Further details on this process can be found in the
>> +documentation for the GETSEC instruction provided by Intel's TXT and the SKINIT
>> +instruction provided by AMD's AMD-V. The documentation on these technologies
>> +can be readily found online; see the `Resources`_ section below for references.
>> +
>> +.. note::
>> +    Currently only Intel TXT is supported in this first release of the Secure
>> +    Launch feature. AMD/Hygon SKINIT and Arm support will be added in a
>> +    subsequent release.
>> +
>> +To enable the kernel to be launched by GETSEC a stub, the Secure Launch stub,
>> +must be built into the setup section of the compressed kernel to handle the
>> +specific state that the dynamic launch process leaves the BSP. Also the Secure
>> +Launch stub must measure everything that is going to be used as early as
>> +possible. This stub code and subsequent code must also deal with the specific
>> +state that the dynamic launch leaves the APs as well.
>> +
>> +Design Decisions
>> +================
>> +
>> +A number of design decisions were made during the development of the Secure
>> +Launch feature. The two primary guiding decisions were:
>> +
>> + - Keeping the Secure Launch code as separate from the rest of the kernel
>> +   as possible.
>> + - Modifying the existing boot path of the kernel as little as possible.
>> +
>> +The following illustrate how the implementation followed these design
>> +decisions:
>> +
>> + - All the entry point code necessary to properly configure the system post
>> +   launch is found in st_stub.S in the compressed kernel image. This code
>> +   validates the state of the system, restores necessary system operating
>> +   configurations and properly handles post launch CPU states.
>> + - After the sl_stub.S is complete, it jumps directly to the unmodified
>> +   startup_32 kernel entry point.
>> + - A single call is made to a function sl_main() prior to the main kernel
>> +   decompression step. This code performs further validation and takes the
>> +   needed DRTM measurements.
>> + - After the call to sl_main(), the main kernel is decompressed and boots as
>> +   it normally would.
>> + - Final setup for the Secure Launch kernel is done in a separate Secure
>> +   Launch module that is loaded via a late initcall. This code is responsible
>> +   for extending the measurements taken earlier into the TPM DRTM PCRs and
>> +   setting up the securityfs interface to allow access the TPM event log and
>> +   public TXT registers.
>> + - On the reboot and kexec paths, calls are made to a function to finalize the
>> +   state of the Secure Launch kernel.
>> +
>> +The one place where Secure Launch code is mixed directly in with kernel code is
>> +in the SMP boot code. This is due to the unique state that the dynamic launch
>> +leaves the APs in. On Intel this involves using a method other than the
>> +standard INIT-SIPI sequence.
>> +
>> +A final note is that originally the extending of the PCRs was completed in the
>> +Secure Launch stub when the measurements were taken. An alternative solution
>> +had to be implemented due to the TPM maintainers objecting to the PCR
>> +extensions being done with a minimal interface to the TPM that was an
>> +independent implementation of the mainline kernel driver. Since the mainline
>> +driver relies heavily on kernel interfaces not available in the compressed
>> +kernel, it was not possible to reuse the mainline TPM driver. This resulted in
>> +the decision to move the extension operations to the Secure Launch module in
>> +the mainline kernel where the TPM driver would be available.
>> +
>> +Basic Boot Flow
>> +===============
>> +
>> +Outlined here is summary of the boot flow for Secure Launch. A more detailed
>> +review of Secure Launch process can be found in the Secure Launch
>> +Specification, a link is located in the `Resources`_ section.
>> +
>> +Pre-launch: *Phase where the environment is prepared and configured to initiate the
>> +secure launch by the boot chain.*
>> +
>> + - The SLRT is initialized and dl_stub is placed in memory.
>> + - Load the kernel, initrd and ACM [2]_ into memory.
>> + - Setup the TXT heap and page tables describing the MLE [1]_ per the
>> +   specification.
>> + - If non-UEFI platform, dl_stub is called.
>> + - If UEFI platforms, SLRT registered with UEFI and efi-stub called.
>> + - Upon completion, efi-stub will call EBS followed by dl_stub.
>> + - The dl_stub will prepare the CPU and the TPM for the launch.
>> + - The secure launch is then initiated with the GETSET[SENTER] instruction.
>> +
>> +Post-launch: *Phase where control is passed from the ACM to the MLE and the secure
>> +kernel begins execution.*
>> +
>> + - Entry from the dynamic launch jumps to the SL stub.
>> + - SL stub fixes up the world on the BSP.
>> + - For TXT, SL stub wakes the APs, fixes up their worlds.
>> + - For TXT, APs are left halted waiting for an NMI to wake them.
>> + - SL stub jumps to startup_32.
>> + - SL main does validation of buffers and memory locations. It sets
>> +   the boot parameter loadflag value SLAUNCH_FLAG to inform the main
>> +   kernel that a Secure Launch was done.
>> + - SL main locates the TPM event log and writes the measurements of
>> +   configuration and module information into it.
>> + - Kernel boot proceeds normally from this point.
>> + - During early setup, slaunch_setup() runs to finish some validation
>> +   and setup tasks.
>> + - The SMP bring up code is modified to wake the waiting APs. APs vector
>> +   to rmpiggy and start up normally from that point.
>> + - SL platform module is registered as a late initcall module. It reads
>> +   the TPM event log and extends the measurements taken into the TPM PCRs.
>> + - SL platform module initializes the securityfs interface to allow
>> +   access to the TPM event log and TXT public registers.
>> + - Kernel boot finishes booting normally
>> + - SEXIT support to leave SMX mode is present on the kexec path and
>> +   the various reboot paths (poweroff, reset, halt).
>> +
>> +PCR Usage
>> +=========
>> +
>> +The TCG DRTM architecture there are three PCRs defined for usage, PCR.Details
>> +(PCR17), PCR.Authorities (PCR18), and PCR.DLME_Authority (PCR19). For a deeper
>> +understanding of Detail and Authorities it is recommended to review the TCG
>> +DRTM architecture.
>> +
>> +To determine PCR usage, Linux Secure Launch follows the TrenchBoot Secure
>> +Launch Specification of using a measurement policy stored in the SLRT. The
>> +policy details what should be measured and the PCR in which to store the
>> +measurement. The measurement policy provides the ability to select the
>> +PCR.DLME_Detail (PCR20) PCR as the location for the DRTM components measured by
>> +the kernel, e.g. external initrd image. This can then be combined with storing
>> +the user authority in the PCR.DLME_Authority PCR to seal/attest to different
>> +variations of platform details/authorities and user details/authorities. An
>> +example of how this can be achieved was presented in the FOSDEM - 2021 talk
>> +"Secure Upgrades with DRTM".
