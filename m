Flipping SBR bit can be done on any PCI-to-PCI bridge device and in this
topology there are following: PCIe Root Port, ASMedia PCIe Switch
Upstream Port, ASMedia PCIe Switch Downstream Port, Pericom PCIe Switch
Upstream Port, Pericom PCIe Switch Downstream Port.
(Maciej, I hope that this is whole topology and there is not some other
device of PCI-to-PCI bridge type in your setup; please correct me)

Bjorn, to make it clear, on which device you mean to issue secondary bus
reset?

Because I would not be surprised if different things happen when issuing
bus reset on different parts of that topology.
