Thanks, this is exactly the sort of thing I was looking for.  Since
they all mention "connected after boot," I assume the issue with the
current code is that a hotplug notification is being missed because a
bridge is in D3.

If the devices are present and enumerated at boot, there's no issue
with suspend/resume, right?

What do you think of the following possible text?  I don't want to be
overly specific because I don't think it's practical to list every
scenario.  We just need a hook to make people think "Hmm, I'm seeing a
dock issue; maybe this is the fix."

  This fixes problems where a hotplug notification is missed because a
  bridge is in D3.  That means hot-added devices such as USB4 docks
  (and the devices they contain) and Thunderbolt 3 devices may not
  work.
