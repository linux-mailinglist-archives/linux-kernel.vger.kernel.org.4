Trond,

I'm looking at a commit from 2005:

0f9dc2b16884b ("RPC: Clean up socket autodisconnect")

     Cancel autodisconnect requests inside xprt_transmit() in order to avoid
     races.
     Use more efficient del_singleshot_timer_sync()


I'm working on adding a "shutdown" state to timers, making it required for
freeing the timer. This is to address the numerous bugs we hit where timers
get rearmed just before freeing and then cause a crash in the timer code,
without knowing what timer it was that caused it.

Having a specific shutdown state for timers will remove this problem
because if something tries to rearm a shutdown timer, it will fail and a
WARN_ON_ONCE() is triggered. See below in the "reply" part for a
description of this effort.

The reason for this email, is because that WARN_ON_ONCE() triggered on the
mod_timer() from:

static void
xprt_schedule_autodisconnect(struct rpc_xprt *xprt)
	__must_hold(&xprt->transport_lock)
{
	xprt->last_used = jiffies;
	if (RB_EMPTY_ROOT(&xprt->recv_queue) && xprt_has_timer(xprt))
		mod_timer(&xprt->timer, xprt->last_used + xprt->idle_timeout);
}

That's because xptr->timer was shutdown due to:

int
xprt_request_enqueue_receive(struct rpc_task *task)
{
	[..]
	/* Turn off autodisconnect */
	del_singleshot_timer_sync(&xprt->timer);
	return 0;
}

Now singleshot means just that. It's a single shot and calling
del_singleshot_timer_sync() will shut it down so that it can be freed. That
also means that it can no longer be re-armed.

I'm not sure what you meant by "Use more efficient del_singleshot_timer_sync()"
but I'm guessing since that was written in 2005, it is no longer relevant,
and del_timer_sync() should now be used.

After replacing that with del_timer_sync(), the warning goes away.

I just want to confirm that's OK with you.

Thanks,

-- Steve
