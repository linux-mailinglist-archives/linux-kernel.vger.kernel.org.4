No worries, doing my best to address that.

Yes, the current code will return 'true' if _PR0 or _PS0 is present
for dev regardless of anything else.

The proposed change is to make that conditional on whether or not _S0W
for the root port says that wakeup from D3 is supported (or it is not
present or unusable).

I see that I've missed one point now which is when the root port
doesn't have an ACPI companion, in which case we should go straight
for the "dev is power manageable" check.  Let me redo the patch to
address this.
