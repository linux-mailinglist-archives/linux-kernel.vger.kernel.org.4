I don't remember why 8fd4391ee717 exists; I assume there was some
platform that needed it.  I should have included that in the commit
log; mea culpa.

In any event, I assume Windows works on both that platform and the
ones mentioned in this quirk, and I assume Windows doesn't require
platform-specific quirks for something like this.  I admit that's a
lot of assuming, but if Windows can do it, Linux should be able to do
it, too.
