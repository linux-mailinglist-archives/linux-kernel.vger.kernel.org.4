I don't think that really addresses my comment, due to the second sentence.  I
understand that you would like to advertise the performance of LEA.  But as I
mentioned, it's not yet realized in the kernel crypto API, and in the context of
fscrypt it won't really bring anything new to the table anyway.  For now I think
LEA is best described as a "national pride cipher" alongside SM4...  Keep in
mind, it can always be changed later if new use cases come up.

Could you just omit the documentation update from your patch?  I actually need
to rework the whole "Encryption modes and usage" section anyway since it's
growing a bit unwieldy, with 6 different combinations of encryption modes now
supported.  The information needs to be organized better.  It currently reads
like a list, and it might be hard for users to understand which setting to use.

I'll add on a patch that does that and adds the mention of LEA support.
