Ah interesting, I missed the __mutex_waiter_is_first() in the mutex code,
where it looks to do basically the same thing as rt_mutex (but slightly
different). From looking at this, it appears that mutex() has FIFO fair
logic, where the second waiter will sleep.

Would be interesting to see why John sees such a huge difference between
normal mutex and rtmutex if they are doing the same thing. One thing is
perhaps the priority logic is causing the issue, where this will not
improve anything.

I wonder if we add spinning to normal mutex for the other waiters if that
would improve things or make them worse?

Only if the lock becomes free.

Yes, but in a FIFO order, where in rt_mutex, a second, higher priority task
can make the first ones sleep. So maybe it's just the priority logic that
is causing the issues.

You mean, "Don't spin if the next owner is not on any CPU"?
