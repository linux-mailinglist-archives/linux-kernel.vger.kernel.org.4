I see.

Yeah, that's unfortunate. There are several options here:

1. Do what you originally suggested - bypass to root after offline. I feel
   uneasy about this. Both iolatency and throtl clear their configs on
   offline but that's punting to the parent. For iocost it'd be bypassing
   all controls, which can actually be exploited.

2. Make all possible IO issuers use blkcg_[un]pin_online() and shift the
   iocost shutdown to pd_offline_fn(). This likely is the most canonical
   solution given the current situation but it's kinda nasty to add another
   layer of refcnting all over the place.

3. Order blkg free so that parents are never freed before children. You did
   this by adding refcnts in iocost but shouldn't it be possible to simply
   shift blkg_put(blkg->parent) in __blkg_release() to blkg_free_workfn()?

#3 seems the most logical to me. What do you thinK?

Thanks.
