Josef found some real bugs with this warning enabled and then we decided
it would be a good idea to have it enabled for all builds. If we don't
do it by default then the chances that people will use it are low.

Yeah the warning is speculative so the compilers can report more false
positives. I still have some very old test setups and the compiler gets
updated rarely, IIRC I went from 4.x to 7.x and now there's 10.x so I
might send some warning fixes myself.  Over time I'd like to enable more
warnings just for fs/btrfs/.
