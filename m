I hope it's clear from my other replies in this thread that the entire
purpose of this driver is to allow arbitrary platform devices to be used
via a PCI device in virtual environments like User Mode Linux in order
to test existing platform drivers using mocked hardware.

Given this "hardware", it's not clear what a "real driver" would do
differently.  The auxiliary bus cannot be used since it naturally does
not support platform devices.  A hard coded list of sub-devices cannot
be used since arbitrary platform devices with arbitrary devicetree
properties need to be supported.

I could move this driver to drivers/bus/ and pitch it as a
"PCI<->platform bridge for testing in virtual environments", if that
makes more sense.
