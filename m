This has admittedly changed over time, but the preference to avoid
reverse-engineering control flow has been around for a while. For example,
during LPC 2021's "objtool on arm64" session:

  https://lpc.events/event/11/contributions/971/

... where Will and I expressed strong desires to get the compiler to help,
whether that's compiler-generated metadata, (agreed upon) restrictions on code
generation, or something else.

There are several possibilities, e.g.

* Generate some simple metadata that tells us for each PC whether to start an
  unwind from the LR or FP. My understanding was that SFrame *might* be
  sufficient for this.

  We might need some custom metadata for assembly (e.g. exception entry,
  trampolines), but it'd be ok for that to be different.

* Agree upon some restricted patterns for code generation (e.g. fixed
  prologues/epilogues), so that we can identify whether to use LR or FP based
  on the PC and a symbol lookup.

That's not quite my argument.

My argument is that if we assume some set of properties that compiler folk
never agreed to (and were never made aware of), then compiler folk are well
within their rights to change the compiler such that it doesn't provide those
properties, and it's very likely that such expectation will be broken. We've
seen that happen before (e.g. with jump tables).

Consequently I think we should be working with compiler folk to agree upon some
solution, where compiler folk will actually try to maintain the properties we
depend upon (and e.g. they could have tests for). That sort of co-design has
worked well so far (e.g. with things like kCFI).

Ideally we'd have people in the same room to have a discussion (e.g. at LPC).

I don't disagree with that.

I tried to do so a bit above.

I'm looking for some agreement between kernel folk and compiler folk on a
reliable mechanism. That might be something that already exists, or something
new. It might be metadata or some restrictions on code generation.

From looking around, that session was:

  https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1177/

At the time it was called CTF Frame, but got renamed to SFrame.

I'm not sure where to find the most recent documentation. As I mentioned above
I have not had the time to look in detail.

Thanks for doing so; that's much appreciated!

Thanks, 
Mark.
