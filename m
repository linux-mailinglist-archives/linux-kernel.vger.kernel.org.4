Sorry for such a long delay to reply to this,

here is what I have.

Access to TA using SCM calls remain valid and it will continue to work 
till SM8550 and probably after that if the TA is *NOT* loaded using 
smcinvoke for some reasons.

But overall by default on all new SoCs after sm8550 all the access to TA 
is only done via smcinvoke, and the underlying scm call that are used in 
this patchset will not be supported anymore.

 From SM8550, we will need to move this driver to a proper TEE client 
kernel driver.

So, with that in mind, I would suggest that we carefully name the 
compatibles based on SoC rather than generic ones.
