I think you're assuming the proposal requires dma-buf exporter driver
changes, and I have a 'hacked up out of tree driver' not visible to
you. Both are not quite right. The proposal requires no changes to the
dma-buf exporter, and works with udmabuf _as is_, proving that. Please
do review the proposal:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20230710223304.1174642-1-almasrymina@google.=
com/

If you still don't like the approach, we can try something else.

The current proposal requires no changes to the dma-buf exporters:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20230710223304.1174642-1-almasrymina@google.=
com/

On dma-buf changes required. I do need approval from the dma-buf
maintainers, but AFAICT, no approval from the dma-buf exporters (all I
need is already supported). If we need to change direction to a
proposal that needs additional support from the driver owners, yes,
we'd need their approval, but this is not the case at the moment.
