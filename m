seccomp-bpf doesn't rely on JIT, so it is not an issue. For eBPF, JIT is 
optional, but other text changes may be required according to the eBPF 
program type (e.g. using kprobes).

The next step is to handle dynamic permissions, but it will be easier to 
first implement that in KVM itself (which already has the required 
authentication code). The current interface may be flexible enough 
though, only new attribute flags should be required (and potentially an 
async mode). Anyway, this will enable to look at the whole thing.

Not necessarily to move this code, but to make sure that the changes are 
legitimate (e.g. text signatures, legitimate addresses). This doesn't 
need to be perfect but it should improve the current state by increasing 
the cost of attacks.
