The unwinder on arm64 is frame-pointer based. I don't want to deviate from that.
I just want to use the metadata to validate the frame pointer. This approach
also catches the rare cases of frame pointer corruption and any bugs in
SFrame that the metadata check did not catch.

Of course, this is all moot if the arm64 folks do not even want the reverse engineering.
I guess we wait until the microconference to discuss all this.
