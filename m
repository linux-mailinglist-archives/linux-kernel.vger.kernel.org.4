We don't have plans for unprivileged users currently. I think that is a
great goal and requires a proper tracing namespace, which we currently
don't have. I've done some thinking on this, but I would like to hear
your thoughts and others on how to do this properly. We do talk about
this in the tracefs meetings (those might be out of your time zone
unfortunately).

Ok, I based that approach on the feedback given in LPC 2022 - Containers
and Checkpoint/Retore MC [1]. I believe you gave feedback to use user
namespaces to provide the encapsulation that was required :)

Unprivileged containers is not a goal, however, having a per-pod
user_event system name, such as user_event_<pod_name>, would be ideal
for certain diagnostic scenarios, such as monitoring the entire pod.

When you have a lot of containers, you also want to limit how many
tracepoints each container can create, even if they are given access to
the tracefs file. The per-group can limit how many events/tracepoints
that container can go create, since we currently only have 16-bit
identifiers for trace_event's we need to be cautious we don't run out.

user_events in general has tracepoint validators to ensure the payloads
coming in are "safe" from what the kernel might do with them, such as
filtering out data.

I followed the patch I already stated, there would be a new tracefs file
that only admins have access to. Admins can then create groups, assign
limits, then finally attach them user namespaces once they have been
configured.

I'm sure there are other approaches, see [1] where another approach was
proposed by Mathieu, but then feedback in the crowd was to use user
namespaces instead.

trace_events in the tracing facility require both a system name and an
event name. IE: sched/sched_waking, sched is the system name,
sched_waking is the event name. For user_events in the root group, the
system name is "user_events". When groups are introduced, the system
name can be "user_events_<GUID>" for example.

The user_events ABI never lets anyone dictate the system name to allow
for this isolation. IE: user_events/myevent vs
user_events<GUID>/myevent are entirely different trace_events on the
system. This is called out as a note in the user_events documentation
today that the system name can and will change to allow for isolation in
the future.
