I cannot simply add io-channels to the sound card directly. I need a node
to set at least the sound-name-prefix property. Further more having a node
and a related compatible string can be easier to maintain and add future
evolution related to these "virtual" devices.

As some subnodes are already defined for a sound card node, I propose to
group these "virtual" audio devices node in a specific bundle node.
This lead to the following example:

    spi {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
	/* potentiometers present in an input amplifier design */
        pot_in: potentiometer@0 {
            compatible = "foo,xxx";
            reg = <0>;
            #io-channel-cells = <1>;
        };
	/* potentiometers present in an output amplifier design */
	pot_out: potentiometer@1 {
            compatible = "foo,xxx";
            reg = <1>;
            #io-channel-cells = <1>;
        };
	/* A codec */
        codec: codec@2 {
            compatible = "bar,yyy";
            reg = <2>;
            sound-name-prefix = "CODEC";
        };

    };

    sound {
        compatible = "simple-audio-card";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        simple-audio-card,name = "My Sound Card";

        simple-audio-card,aux-devs = <&amp_in>, <&amp_out>;
        simple-audio-card,routing =
            "CODEC IN0", "AMP_IN CH0 OUT",
            "CODEC IN1", "AMP_IN CH1 OUT",
            "AMP_OUT CH0 IN", "CODEC OUT0",
            "AMP_OUT CH1 IN", "CODEC OUT1";

        simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {
            ...
        };

        ...

        /* A bundle for the additional devices */
        simple-audio-card,additional-devs { 
            amp_out: aux-out {
                compatible = "audio-iio-aux";    /* Instead of "simple-iio-aux */
                io-channels = <&pot_out 0>, <&pot_out 1>,
                io-channel-names = "CH0", "CH1";
                snd-control-invert-range = <1 1>;  /* Old 'invert' renamed */
                sound-name-prefix = "AMP_OUT";
            };

            amp_in: aux-in {
	       compatible = "audio-iio-aux";
               io-channels = <&pot_in 0>, <&pot_in 1>;
	       io-channel-names = "CH0", "CH1";
	       sound-name-prefix = "AMP_IN";

What do you think about this new binding ?
