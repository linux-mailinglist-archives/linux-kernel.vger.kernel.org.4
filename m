I think you can probably leave out the details about Firmware-First.
Pointing to 6.7.6 and the fact that Surprise Down Errors may occur as
an expected side-effect of surprise removal is sufficient.  They should
be treated as such.

You also want to point out what you're trying to achieve here, i.e. get
rid of irritating log messages and a 1 sec delay while pciehp waits for
DPC recovery.

Add an explanation to the commit message that masking Surprise Down Errors
was explored as an alternative approach, but scrapped due to the odd
behavior that masking only avoids the interrupt, but still records an
error per PCIe r6.0.1 sec 6.2.3.2.2.  That stale error is going to be
reported the next time some error other than Surprise Down is handled.

Which bits are set exactly?  Can you constrain the register write to
those bits?

Emit an error message here?

I'd move that code comment to into dpc_handler() above the
"if (dpc_is_surprise_removal(pdev))" check.

Do you need a "wake_up_all(&dpc_completed_waitqueue);" at the end
of the function to wake up a pciehp handler waiting for DPC recovery?

You need an additional check for pdev->is_hotplug_bridge here.

And you need to read PCI_EXP_SLTCAP and check for PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_HPS.

Return false if either of them isn't set.

A function named "..._is_..." should not have any side effects.
So move the dpc_handle_surprise_removal() call down into dpc_handler()
before the "return IRQ_HANDLED;" statement.


What about ports which support AER but not DPC?  Don't you need to
amend aer.c in that case?  I suppose you don't have hardware without
DPC to test that?

Thanks,

Lukas
