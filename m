Thanks a lot for your explanation, Sean. Questions are embedded below:

Do you mean the VMX MSR model shall not be changed after the cpuid updates?
And for VMX MSR model, do you mean the vmx->nested.msrs or the ones in 
vmcs_config->nested? 

What I observed is that vmx->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high will be changed
in vmx_adjust_secondary_exec_control(), which can be triggered after cpuid is
set. 

Since KVM's config(vmcs_config->nested.secondary_ctls_high) is done during init
by nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs(), which only kept a subset of the flags from the
vmcs_confg->cpu_based_2nd_exec_ctrl, the vmx_restore_control_msr() could fail
later, when userspace VMM tries to enable a feature(the only one I witnessed is
SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE) by setting MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2.
Because the vmx->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high is updated by cpuid, but this
bit is not taken from vmcs_conf->cpu_based_2nd_exec_ctrl by nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs()
for vmcs_config->nested.secondary_ctls_high.

The failure can be fixed, simply by adding SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE in
nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs(), e.g.

And then reset many of the remaining flags based on configurations such as
enable_ept, enable_vpid, enable_unrestricted_guest etc... But maybe we need
go through this case by case.

My understanding is that, for VMFUNC, altough KVM does not support it,
SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VMFUNC is still set in the secondary proc-based
vm execution ctrol. KVM just uses different handlers for VMFUNC exits
from L1(to inject the #UD) and L2(to emulate the eptp switching). So
it doesn't matter if we do not clear this bit for vmcs_config->nested.
procbased_ctls_high. 

I may probably missed something. But I hope my questions are clear 
enough (though I also doubt it...) :)
