I'm also interested in using this with struct_ops, not just tracing. I
think that struct_ops should be totally fine though, and easier to
reason about than tracing as we just have to make sure that a few
specific callbacks are always passed a valid, referenced task, rather
than e.g. worrying about fexit on __put_task_struct().

I'm fine with adding this now and working towards closing the gaps
later, though I'd like to hear what Martin, Alexei, and the rest of the
BPF maintainers think. I think Martin asked if there was any preliminary
work you'd already done that we could try to tie into this patch set,
and I'm similarly curious.

Much appreciated!
