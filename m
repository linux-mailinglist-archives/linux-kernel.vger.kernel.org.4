This is not remotely sufficient justification.  Memory "barriers" are just compiler
barriers on x86, so the odds of regressing the VM-Enter/VM-Exit cost without
introducing a bug are miniscule.

Except this isn't as early as possible.  If we're going to bother doing something
like this, my vote is to move it into assembly.

No, worst case scenario is that kvm_vcpu_exiting_guest_mode() sees EXITING_GUEST_MODE
and doesn't kick the vCPU.  For "kicks" that set a request, kvm_vcpu_exit_request()
will punt the vCPU out of the tight run loop, though there might be ordering issues.

But whether or not there are ordering issues is a moot point since there are uses
of kvm_vcpu_kick() that aren't accompanied by a request, e.g. to purge the PML
buffers.  In other words, kvm_vcpu_kick() absolutely cannot have false negatives.
We could modify KVM to require a request when using kvm_vcpu_kick(), but that's
a bit of a hack, and all of the possible ordering problems is still a pile of
complexity I'd rather avoid.

No small part of me thinks we'd be better off adding a dedicated flag to very
precisely track whether or not the vCPU is truly "in the guest" for the purposes
of sending IPIs.  Things like kicks have different requirements around IN_GUEST_MODE
than sending interrupts, e.g. KVM manually processes the IRR on every VM-Enter and
so lack of an IPI is a non-issue, whereas missing an IPI for a kick is problematic.
In other words, EXITING_GUEST_MODE really needs to mean "existing the run loop".

E.g. toggle the dedicated flag within a few instructions of VM-Enter and
VM-Exit for maximum efficiency for interrupts, and avoid having to make vcpu->mode
more complex than it already is.

To add clarity, we could even rename IN_GUEST_MODE and EXITING_GUEST_MODE to
something like IN_RUN_LOOP and EXITING_RUN_LOOP.

Heh, justifying the lack of a memory barrier by saying pointing out the other

It's far easier, likely more performant, documents why this has a chance of working,
and significantly less error prone to do this unconditionally in either assembly
or after the EXIT_FASTPATH_REENTER_GUEST check in vcpu_enter_guest().
