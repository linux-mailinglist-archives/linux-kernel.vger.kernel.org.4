That code only increments PMCs configured to count "instructions
retired" and "branch instructions retired." It does not increment PMCs
configured to count "CPUID instructions retired."

Reference cycles unhalted fails to increment outside of guest mode.

SMIs received counts *physical* rather than virtual SMIs

Interrupts taken counts *physical* rather than virtual interrupts taken.

But at least Intel has a list of architected events, which are mostly
amenable to virtualization.
