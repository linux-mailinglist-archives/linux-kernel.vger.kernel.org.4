I've put it on my todo list to try and come up with something standalone 
for this problem. Will see if I manage to send it separately or perhaps 
will start the next cgroup controller RFC with those patches.

Yeah I think I have all that. I track struct pid, with a reference, in 
drm client, and release it when file descriptor is closed (indirectly 
via the DRM close hook). All I need, I think, is for that mapping to 
answer me "which drm_file objects" are in use by this struct pid 
pointer. I don't see a problem with lifetimes or scope yet.
