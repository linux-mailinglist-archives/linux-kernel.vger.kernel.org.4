If accesses to the deleted memslot are a guest bug, why do you care about pausing
vCPUs?  I don't mean to be beligerent, I'm genuinely confused.

What exactly is the behavior you're trying to achieve for KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG => delete?
If KVM provides KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT, can you not achieve the desired behavior by
doing mprotect(PROT_NONE) => KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG => delete?  If PROT_NONE causes the
memory to be freed, won't mprotect(PROT_READ) do what you want even without
KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT?

Aren't all of those out of scope?  E.g. in a very hypothetical world where XEN's
event channel is being used with VTLs, if VTL1 makes the event channel inaccessible,
that's a guest and/or userspace configuration issue and the guest is hosed no matter
what KVM does.  Ditto for these case where KVM-GT's buffer is blocked.  I'm guessing
the ITS is similar?

How do the ioctls() map to VTLs?  I.e. are they considered VTL0, VTL1, out-of-band?

As above, can't userspace just mprotect() the entire memslot to prevent writes
between getting the dirty log and deleting the memslot?
