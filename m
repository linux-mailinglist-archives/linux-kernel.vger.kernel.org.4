It's mostly a few experimental patches in my local tree, so nowhere
close to completion. Ofcourse doing it properly will be a lot of work,
but I will be happy to help with reviews if you want to focus on
pointers loaded from ctx for now and make that part of this set, while
not permitting any other cases. It should not be very difficult to add
just that.

So you can set KF_TRUSTED_ARGS for your kfunc, then make it work for
PTR_TO_BTF_ID where it either has PTR_TRUSTED, ref_obj_id > 0, or
both. Just that PTR_TRUSTED is lost for the destination reg as soon as
btf_struct_access is used to walk pointers (unlike PTR_UNTRUSTED which
is inherited). Note that you don't _set_ PTR_UNTRUSTED here for the
dst_reg.

This should enable your immediate use case, while also being useful
for future work that builds on it. It should also preserve backwards
compatibility with existing stable helpers. You set PTR_TRUSTED when
you access ctx of tracing or struct_ops etc. All this will be handled
in is_valid_access callback/btf_ctx_access and setting the flag in
bpf_insn_access_aux. Unless I missed some detail/corner case it won't
be a lot of code.

If that turns out to be too restrictive/coarse for your use case, we
can just go with this as is for now.

Does that sound good? Any other comments/opinions?
