The malloc() is the least or our concerns, tbh. It is only used by the
decompression library itself, and it is backed by a statically
allocated block of BSS.

Having just gone through this again, the main issues are:

1) The 4/5 level switching trampoline, which runs in the page tables
of the loader/EFI stub, and assumes that it is fine to grab a random
chunk of low memory, stash its contents somewhere, use it for some
code, a stack and a root level page table so we can do the x86 long
mode paging off/paging on salsa, and then copy back the contents and
carry on as if nothing happened. We currently have some code in the
stub that strips all NX restrictions from a generously overdimensioned
block of low memory so copying and running code like this actually
works.

2) We need an accurate description in the PE/COFF header of what needs
to be executable and what needs to be writable, so we can splt the
regions. This only matters for code that runs under EFI's mappings, so
not a lot.

3) The payload relocates itself to the end of the decompression buffer
so it doesn't overwrite itself before completing. This is fragile and
also unnecessary when there is a page allocator and plenty of memory,
but afaict, this all executes under the decompressor's own page tables
so the RO/NX attributes that EFI sets are not a concern here. It
would, of course, be nice if we could avoid relying on RWX mappings
here.

4) I think it was you who pointed out that the demand paging 1:1 map
should really only get triggered for data accesses and not code
accesses, so it would be nice if we could create such mappings with NX
attributes.

I've had another go at running the decompressed kernel directly,
without going through the decompressor logic at all, but I missed the
fact that SEV does a substantial amount of work in the decompressor
too, so I'm no longer convinced that this is a viable approach. But
I'm looking into this.

I just finished some patches [0] that only address 1), based on the
work I posted earlier. I'll send those out once -rc1 comes around.
