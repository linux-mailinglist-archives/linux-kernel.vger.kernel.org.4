We do not know how guests that do not disclose their source code
will detect the presence of pmu counters.

For upstream Linux guests, such a check is implemented in the check_hw_exists(),
which checks the counters one by one, often with an error on the first counter,
and then disables pmu from the kernel perspective.

The key point is that the KVM implementation cannot rely on assumptions about
the guest kernel version, and considering that the above check was added very early,
existing Linux guest instances will most likely (tend to) check the first 
counter and
error out (a VM could also check all of the possible counters and use a bitmap with
holes to track any functional counters).

I certainly agree that, for example, a particular cpu model is stated in the spec
to have certain features (e.g. uncore pmu), but the KVM does not or chooses
not ro emulate them, for security reasons (e.g. side channel attacks), which
does violate the defined behavior of the hardware spec, such as here where
enable_pmu is false, which is not possible on almost all real hardware today.

All this is for L2 Linux guest, as pmu on L1 Linux guest will be disabled by L0.

Not 100%, the scheduling of physical counters depends on the host perf scheduler.

I noticed that many cloud vendors want to make sure that hardware resources
are given exclusively to VMs, but for upstream, the availability of resources
should depend entirely on the host administrators, and a VMM should take away
access to resources at any time, such as vcpu time slice.

Any attempts in the direction of exclusive use will be thwarted.

Normal perf use does not grab the counters allocated for kvm, NMI-watchdog
maybe one, but it will be moved to other timer hardware like HPET.

Of interest is that some ebpf programs that access the pmu hardware directly
use the interface that perf sub-system presents to KVM in the kernel.
