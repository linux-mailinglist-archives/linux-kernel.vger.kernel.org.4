No, I'm saying as long as it is a config option, it's not useful for
more than experimentation. A distro kernel has to decide how to set a
config option for *everyone*.

How does that work? The quirks run when a device is discovered. At
that time you've already discovered and probed everything upstream of
the device. So the only thing controlling the upstream devices getting
a DT node is the config option, right?

I missed that...

Well, maybe as preparation to support other classes. If you had a UART
for example, the node name is 'serial'. I don't think you need to
worry about those ATM. We may need some way for the name to come from
the driver as not all devices have a class. Yours for example, we'd
want something like 'fpga@...' ideally. Maybe that's fine to leave as
a known issue.
