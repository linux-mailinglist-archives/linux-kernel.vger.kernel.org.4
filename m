Nothing breaks, it'll error on the safe side.  If the protocol callback
is not called the firmware will simply accept all memory.  The guest OS
will only see unaccepted memory if it explicitly asked for it (assuming
the firmware wants know to support both cases, of course the firmware
could also enforce the one or the other and just not offer the
protocol).

Not sure what you are trying to tell.  The kexec case doesn't go
through the efi stub anyway.

Maybe, maybe not.  unaccepted memory support has a Kconfig switch after
all.  If we figure in 3-5 years that all distros have enabled it anyway
we can drop it again.  For the transition period it will surely be
useful.

take care,
