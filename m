Yes, it was dropped due to the PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT usage apparently 
being incorrect, and some other open debate (which all happened on the 
v5 thread):

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/YzVTmy9MWh+AjshC@lpieralisi/

The DMA mask issues have now been sorted out, so you, or Will, or anyone 
else interested should be free to rework this on top of linux-next 
(although at this point, more realistically on top of 6.3-rc1 in a few 
weeks).

Thanks,
Robin.
