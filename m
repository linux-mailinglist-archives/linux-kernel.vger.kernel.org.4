I certainly agree that inter-subtree links are great to have, though in
my opinion, other features such as linking kernel-doc comments, auto
section labeling, etc make Sphinx very useful in their own right. But
yes, having inter-subtree links is of course a useful feature as well.

Nice, seems like the best of both worlds. A syntax clarification
question: are you saying that this would work?

Or is it required to have the full path inline in the text, as in your
example:

The benefit of the former is of course that you only have to specify the
link in one place.

Based on a quick online search, that indeed sounds like the ideal
solution.
