Good question!

My thinking was that shadow variables might be tight to variables
from a particular livepatched module. It would make sense to free them
when the only user (livepatched module) is removed.

The question is if it is really important. I did re-read the original
issue and the real problem was when the livepatch was reloaded.
The related variables were handled using livepatched code, then
without the livepatched code, and then with the livepatched code
again.

The variable was modified with the original code that was not aware of
the shadow variable. As a result the state of the shadow variable was
not in sync when it was later used again.

Nicolai, your have the practical experience. Should the reference
counting be per-livepatched object or per-livepatch, please?

I am not sure how you mean it. I guess that you suggest to store
the name of the livepatch module into the shadow variable.
And use the variable only when the livepatch module is still loaded.

This would not help.

We use the reference counting because the shadow variables should
survive an atomic replace of the lifepatch. In this case, the related
variables are still handled using a livepatched code that is aware
of the shadow variables.

Also it does not solve the problem that the shadow variable might
get out of sync with the related variable when the same
livepatch gets reloaded.

Best Regards,
Petr
