Hi Mark,

Sorry for the long delay in responding. Was caught up in many things.
My responses inline..

OK. I have been under the impression that the arm64 folks are basically OK with
Objtool's approach of reverse engineering from the binary. I did not see
any specific objections to previously submitted patches based on this approach
including mine.

So, if the community is not in agreement with this approach, I will go back to the
drawing board for this one.

Are there any other opinions on this subject from others?

OK.

So, what exactly do you have in mind? What help can the compiler folk provide?
By your own argument, we cannot rely on the compiler as compiler implementations,
optimization strategies, etc can change in ways that are incompatible with any
livepatch implementation. Also, there can always be bugs in the compiler
implementations.

Can you please elaborate? Are we looking for a way for the compiler folks to
provide us with something that we can use to implement reliable stack trace?

I will try to locate the link. If you can provide me a link, that would be greatly
appreciated. I will study their SFrame proposal.

I am willing to do this. But I am not clear on the kind of features we want
from the compiler. Are you suggesting something for getting a reliable
stack trace? Is there any kind of proposal out there that I need to study?

I will try to get the data again and put something together and send it to the
gcc folks.

Thanks for the suggestions.
