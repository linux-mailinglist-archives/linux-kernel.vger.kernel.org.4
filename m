I was thinking along the line of using common helpers for doing fork and 
attach. However, the expected method function prototypes are quite 
different. For example,

int (*can_attach)(struct cgroup_taskset *tset);
int (*can_fork)(struct task_struct *task, css_set *cset);

We need to make them more similar before we can use common helpers. I 
can take a look at that.
