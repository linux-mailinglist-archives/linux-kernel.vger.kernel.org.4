I would expect the loopback scenario for provision to behave similar to
how discards are handled. I.e., loopback receives a provision request
and translates that to fallocate(mode = 0). If the backing device is
block, blkdev_fallocate(mode = 0) translates that to another provision
request.  If the backing device is a file, the associated fallocate
handler allocs/maps, if necessary, and then issues a provision on
allocation, if enabled by the fs.

AFAICT there's no need for FL_PROVISION at all in that scenario. Is
there a functional purpose to FL_PROVISION? Is the intent to try and
guarantee that a provision request propagates down the I/O stack? If so,
what happens if blocks were already preallocated in the backing file (in
the loopback file example)?

BTW, an unrelated thing I noticed is that blkdev_fallocate()
unconditionally calls truncate_bdev_range(), which probably doesn't make
sense for any sort of alloc mode.

I think I see why you make the distinction, since the block layer
doesn't have a "this layer only" mode, but IMO it's also quite confusing
to say that mode == FL_PROVISION can allocate at the current and
underlying layer(s) but mode == 0 to that underlying layer cannot.

Either way, if you want to propose a new falloc mode/modifier, it
probably warrants a more detailed commit log with more explanation of
the purpose, examples of behavior, perhaps some details on how the mode
might be documented in man pages, etc.
