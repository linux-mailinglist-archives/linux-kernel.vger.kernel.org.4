Even that is a bit of a minefield, as there is no guarantee that line
names are unique across the system.  I'm not even sure they are unique
across a chip.

So what order do you iterate over all the lines?
In chip order?  Chip names/numbers aren't deterministic.
The latest tools go in chip name order - human sorted, which is probably
the best we can do - it at least makes sense to the casual user.

The big problem being, once we put in the library proper it is etched in
stone, so we want to get it right and not open any cans of worms.

I don't mean examples in docs, I mean working code examples.
That beats docs every day in my book.

To be clear, I am suggesting extensions to the API, not changes to it.
libgpiod v2 is fixed and the functions therein will remain as-is.
But v2.1 could get some additional functions to make common tasks easier.
At least, that is what I would like to see.

Cheers,
Kent.
