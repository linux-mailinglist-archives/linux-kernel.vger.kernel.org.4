I was struggling to see how that addresses the problem because all you
need is a read permission. But then I've looked into cgroup code and
learned that permissions are constructed based on available callbacks
(cgroup_file_mode). This would have made the review easier ;)

I have no issue with the patch. It would be great to hear from cgroup
maintainers whether a concept of default permissions is something that
would be useful also for other files.

After you add your s-o-b, feel free to add

If cgroup people find a concept of default permissions for a cgroup file
sound then this could be replaced by that approach but this is really an
easy workaround.

I would just reference cgroup_file_mode() in the comment to make our
lifes easier and comment more helpful.
