The way the HW shall be described in DT is tightly coupled to the way 
the drivers will work on mapping the IO addresses.

There are 3 ways to describe the HW as far as I see it from address 
point of view: (actually 2 as option 3 is not really sane)

1) one big chunk of registers

2) smaller chunk of registers aiming to have each chunk describe a 
subset of the HW capablity (e.g. RAS, e.g. Refresh-rate, ...)

3) describe each register with its name

Each option dictate how driver shall map the address space.


If option 1 is chosen, then we shall have 2 drivers with same reg 
description.

For that case, they can both remap the whole space or each one can try 
to map only the section it needs.

If option 2 is chosen, then each driver can use DT to know exactly what 
it needs to map and do it in safer manner.
