Those are trickier due to the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON tagging bit which your
code doesn't need to handle because you can simply store an untagged
anon_vma pointer. Otherwise we could have the union at the struct page
level already (but probably not at this point as IIRC Matthew is
planning to have completely separate types for anon and file folios).

So right now we have e.g. folio_get_anon_vma() using unsigned long as
the intermediate variable, page_move_anon_rmap() using a void *
variable, __page_set_anon_rmap() casting through a (void *) ... Is there
a single recommended way for "tagged pointers" that we could unify that to?
