Thank you for testing, I have also tested with a Ryzen host, I have IOMMU
enabled as well.

Good to hear that it now works, I'll try them as well.

Interesting that you are working on this, I started to patch the RK3399 PCIe
endpoint controller driver for a similar project, I want to run our NVMe
firmware in a Linux PCIe endpoint function.

For the IRQs there are two things that come to mind:
1) The host driver could actually disable them and work in polling mode,
I have seen that with different versions of the Linux kernel NVMe driver
sometimes it would choose to use polling instead of IRQs for the queues.
So maybe it's just the
2) The RK3399 PCIe endpoint controller is said to be able only to generate
one type of interrupt at a given time. "It is capable of generating MSI or
Legacy interrupt if the PCIe is configured as EP. Notes that one PCIe
component can't generate both types of interrupts. It is either one or the
other." (see TRM 17.5.9 Interrupt Support).
I don't know exactly what the TRM means the the controller cannot
use both interrupts at the same time, but this might be a path to explore
