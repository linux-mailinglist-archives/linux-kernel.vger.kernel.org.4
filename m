Actually, I disagree after thinking about it for a while. Since
Google turns on CONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION on default, this
KVM_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION() is literally BUG_ON(). Then there is no
point. The purpose of the series is to save the host from crash.

If we follow the upper changes on get_mmio_spte() as well, we are
introducing more BUG()!, ie., more chances to crash the host machine. So
I cannot stay with this idea.

In fact, there could many reasons why RMAPs and SPTEs are messed. In
many times, as illustrated by my example, they are not data corruptions.
They are just errors due to code refactoring or some miscalculations
under certain tricky corner situations, e.g., offset by 1.  So, treating
them blindly as data corruptions is an overkill. This is a comparison to
the list traversal bug, which clearly shows data corruptions.

So, alternatively, I think it should be reasonable to shutdown the KVM
instance if we see things messed up in MMIO SPTEs as well, but please
don not the host for that.
