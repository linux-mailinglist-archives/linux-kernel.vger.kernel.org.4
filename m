It is far from perfect but the existing behavior isn't that broken. e.g. in
the same scenario, without pinning, even if the larger cgroup keeps using
the same page, the smaller cgroup should be able to evict the pages as they
are not pinned and the cgroup is under heavy reclaim pressure. The larger
cgroup will refault them back in and end up owning those pages.

memcg can't capture the case of the same pages being actively shared by
multiple cgroups concurrently (I think those cases should be handled by
pushing them to the common parent as discussed elswhere but that's a
separate topic) but it can converge when page usage transfers across cgroups
if needed. Disassociating ownership and pinning will break that in an
irreversible way.

As I wrote above, I don't think the problem here is the case of pages being
shared by multiple cgroups concurrently. We can leave that problem for
another thread. However, if we want to support accounting and control of
pinned memory, we really shouldn't introduce a fundmental discrepancy like
the owner and pinner disagreeing with each other. At least conceptually, the
solution is rather straight-forward - whoever pins a page should also claim
the ownership of it.

Thanks.
