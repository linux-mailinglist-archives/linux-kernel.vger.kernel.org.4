You're still not getting it -- even cpuset (be it v1 or v2) *MUST* *NOT*
mask offline cpus for root cgroup tasks, ever. (And the only reason it
gets away with masking offline for !root is that it re-applies the mask
every time it changes.)

Yes it did that for a fair while -- but it is wrong and broken and a
very big behavioural difference between CONFIG_CPUSET={y,n}. This must
not be.

Arguably cpuset-v2 is still wrong for masking offline cpus in it's
effective_cpus mask, but I really didn't want to go rewrite cpuset.c for
something that needs to go into /urgent *now*.

Hence this minimal patch that at least lets sched_setaffinity() work as
intended.
