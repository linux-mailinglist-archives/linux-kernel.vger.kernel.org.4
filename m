Is there a reason the shadow variable lifetime is tied to klp_object
rather than klp_patch?

I get the feeling the latter would be easier to implement (no reference
counting; also maybe can be auto-detected with THIS_MODULE?) and harder
for the patch author to mess up (by accidentally omitting an object
which uses it).
