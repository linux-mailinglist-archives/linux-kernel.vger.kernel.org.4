I haven't looked at the changes required to conform to 6.0. My 
implementation was more or less a filter driver on top of the pciehp 
slot (if it existed or had to be emulated). It's not really a hack for 
anything and was intended for use with an interposer to a bunch of M.2 
that a OEM wanted to hotplug without adding slot hardware. (Yes I know 
M.2 is not technically hot-pluggable. OEM ended up with sysfs managed 
hotplug with this patchset).

But there are systems out there with U.2 without slot logic that could 
likely survive the event gracefully, given that modern CPUs expect this 
thing in the same way that modern kernels don't rely on Surprise+.


My implementation is a bit of overkill if we'd want to strip it from the 
gpio implementation. If we want to include and extend it, we can make 
the gpio_isr another caller of pciehp_ist() (via [1])
