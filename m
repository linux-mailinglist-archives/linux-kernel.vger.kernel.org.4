That doesn't sound like a big deal.  Currently you can't safely access 
port_dev->child without checking whether it is non-NULL.  You would just 
have to replace one check with another.

The fact that plenty of places touch port_dev->child indicates someone 
must have given some thought to protection against racing accesses.  
Your modifications should be able to benefit from that thought.

Another alternative -- possibly a much simpler one -- is to replicate 
port_dev->child->state in port_dev->state, purely for use by the new 
sysfs routine.  In other words, keep the actual value there instead of a 
pointer to some other location that might get deallocated at any time.

Since presumably you don't care about precise synchronization (that is, 
it doesn't matter if the value shown in the sysfs file is a few tens of 
milliseconds out of date) you could do this without extra locking.  Just 
use WRITE_ONCE() for updates and READ_ONCE() to see what the current 
value is.
