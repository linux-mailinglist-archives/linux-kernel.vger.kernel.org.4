Hi, please consider the following checkpatch.pl patches for review.

The first two changes make checkpatch.pl check for a few mistakes wrt to
links to bug reports Linus recently complained about a few times.
Avoiding those is also important for my regression tracking efforts a
lot, as the automated tracking performed by regzbot relies on the proper
usage of the Link: tag.

The third patch fixes a few small oddities noticed in existing code
during review of the two changes.

Ciao, Thorsten
---
v3->v4:
- address review feedback from Joe (do not allow leading spaces in
matches, check if Link: is actually followed by a URL in one go,
and use m{} for matching https://)  (Thorsten)
- catch Reported-and-tested-by as well (Thorsten)

v2->v3:
- address review feedback from Joe (grammer fixes, use of $herecurr, use
of --no-merges in commit log quote) (Thorsten)
- warn when people try to add version information to the commit log
using code suggested by Joe (Thorsten)
- add a patch to make existing code in a nearby area use $herecurr where
it should, which Joe noticed during review

v1->v2:
- add commit messages explaining the reasoning (Thorsten)
- approach the usage of wrong tags with an allow list as suggested by
Joe (Thorsten)

Kai Wasserb√§ch (2):
  checkpatch: warn when unknown tags are used for links
  checkpatch: warn when Reported-by: is not followed by Link:

Thorsten Leemhuis (1):
  checkpatch: use proper way for show problematic line
