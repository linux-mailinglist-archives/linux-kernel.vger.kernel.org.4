You're being unfair claiming it's vaporware.  You can go out and buy SNP
hardware now (for over a year), the patches are on list and under review
(and have been for quite a while).
If you're claiming it doesn't, please justify it.

Sure, people are working with them; but those are going to take time
and people want to use existing PCIe devices; and given that the hosts
are available that seems reasonable.

It's not that I distrust the virtio bus - just that we need to make sure
it's implementation is pessimistic enough for CoCo.

I think for CoCo the subset is fairly small, even including all the
people discussing it.  It's the virtual devices, and a few of their
favourite physical devices, but a fairly small subset.

As I say above; all happening - but it's going to take years.
It's wrong to leave users with less secure solutions if there are simple
fixes available.  I agree that if it involves major pain all over then
I can see your dislike - but if it's small fixes then what's the
problem?

I'm worried what a malicious hypervisor could do.

I believe the two mechanisms I mentioned above would handle that; when
it eventually gets there.

If it's part of the BIOS image that's measured/loaded during startup
then we're fine; if it's a table dynamically generated by the hypervisor
I'm more worried.

Please point people at those best practices rather than just ranting
about how pointless you feel all this is!

The patches here from Intel are a TOOL to find problems; I can't see the
objections to having a tool like this.

(I suspect some of these fixes might make the kernel a bit more robust
against unexpected hot-remove of PCIe devices as well; but that's more
of a guess)
