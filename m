I believe that the INT3472 code is still involved at least on
a Dell Latitude 9420 the INT3472 code still needs to set the
clock-enable and the privacy-LED GPIOs otherwise the main camera won't
work.

So I'm not sure what you mean with "sensor's power is controlled
by IVSC instead of INT3472" ?

Looking at the ACPI table the sensor ACPI device has 2 _DEP-s listed
the I2C controller and the INT3472 device. Since we are already doing
similar setup in the INT3472 device that seems like a good place
to add the device_link()-s (it can return -EPROBE_DEFER to wait
for the mei_ace to show up).

But when the INT3472 code runs, the consumer device does not exist
yet and AFAICT the same is true when the LCJA i2c-controller driver
is getting registered. The consumer only exists when the i2c_client
is instantiated and at that point the sensor drivers probe() method
can run immediately and we are too late to add the device_link.

As a hobby project I have been working on atomisp2 support and
I have a similar issue there. There is no INT3472 device there,
but there is a _DSM method which needs to be used to figure out
which ACPI GPIO resource is reset / powerdown and if the GPIOs
are active-low or active high.

I have written a little helper function to call the _DSM and
to then turn this into lookups and call devm_acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios().

Since on atomisp2 we cannot use the INT3472 driver to delay
the sensor-driver probe and have the INT3472 driver setup
the GPIO lookup, at least for the sensor drivers used with
atomisp2 there is going to be a need to add a single line
to probe() like this:

	v4l2_get_acpi_sensor_info(&i2c_client->dev, NULL);

To me it sounds like we need to do something similar here
and extend the helper function which I have written
(but not yet submitted upstream) :

https://github.com/jwrdegoede/linux-sunxi/commit/e2287979db43d46fa7d354c1bde92eb6219b613d

To also setup the device-links needed for the runtime-pm
solution to getting the i2c passed through to the sensor.

Ideally v4l2_get_acpi_sensor_info() should return void
(easier to use in the sensor drivers) but I think it should return
an int, so that it can e.g. return -EPROBE_DEFER to wait for
the mei_ace.

Hans
