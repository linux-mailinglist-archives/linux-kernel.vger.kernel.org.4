I don't have a lot of context here but it looks like the problem here is
that the newly proposed controller is introducing an ownership discrepancy.
If a memory which is pinned by a cgroup is to be charged to the owner of the
fd, the memory which isn't pinned should be charged to the memcg of the same
cgroup, right? It makes little sense to me to separate the owner of the
memory page and the pinner of it. They should be one and the same.

Alistair, can you please elaborate how these pages are allocated, charged
and used?

Thanks.
