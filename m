Hey, so, I'm a bit weary that this doesn't seem to have a strong demand at
this point. When there's clear shared demand, I usually hear from multiple
parties about their use cases and the practical problems they're trying to
solve and so on. This, at least to me, seems primarily driven by producers
than consumers.

There's nothing wrong with projecting future usages and jumping ahead the
curve but there's a balance to hit, and going full-on memcg-style controller
with three control knobs seems to be jumping the gun and may create
commitments which we end up looking back on with a bit of regret.

Given that, how about this? We can easily add the functionality of .max
through the misc controller. Add a new key there, trycharge when allocating
new memory, if fails, try reclaim and then fail allocation if reclaim fails
hard enough. I belive that should give at least a reasonable place to start
especially given that memcg only had limits with similar semantics for quite
a while at the beginning.

That way, we avoid creating a big interface commitments while providing a
feature which should be able to serve and test out the immediate usecases.
If, for some reason, many of us end up running hefty applications in SGX, we
can revisit the issue and build up something more complete with provisions
for backward compatibility.

Thanks.
