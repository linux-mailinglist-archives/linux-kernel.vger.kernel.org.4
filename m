May? I think we should cover all of the existing BPF objects from the
beginning here, or we may miss important interactions that will
invalidate the whole idea. In particular, I'm a little worried about the
interaction between namespaces and bpffs; what happens if you're in a
bpf namespace and you try to read a BPF object from a bpffs that belongs
to a different namespace? Does the operation fail? Is the object hidden
entirely? Something else?
