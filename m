Combining the two sub-threads: both of the suggestions:

a) adding a hyperv_flush_guest_mapping(__pa(root->spt) after kvm_tdp_mmu_get_vcpu_root_hpa's call to tdp_mmu_alloc_sp()
b) adding a hyperv_flush_guest_mapping(vcpu->arch.mmu->root.hpa) to svm_flush_tlb_current()

appear to work in my test case (L2 vm startup until panic due to missing rootfs).

But in both these cases (and also when I completely disable HV_X64_NESTED_ENLIGHTENED_TLB)
the runtime of an iteration of the test is noticeably longer compared to tdp_mmu=0.

So in terms of performance the ranking is (fastest to slowest):
1. tdp_mmu=0 + enlightened TLB
2. tdp_mmu=0 + no enlightened TLB
3. tdp_mmu=1 (enlightened TLB makes minimal difference)
