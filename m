Hello Stefano!

Thanks for review! I left some questions, but most of comments are clear
for me. So I guess that idea of split is that I still keep all patches in
a big single patchset, but preserve structure described above and we will
do review process step by step according split?

Or I should split this patchset for 3 separated sets? I guess this will be
more complex to review...

Thanks, Arseniy
