Oh, true.  I've been confused about the two changes.

Yes, moving this into individual drivers is an absolute no-go.

Yes.

I'm tempted to declare [4] buggy until proof of the inverse.

Yes, I'd really like to start out with a common version and then
move bits over.  There's also some interesting bits about handling
highmem for architectures that needs virtual addresss for flushing
that might be worth sharing, too.

Th—ñs should be a new file in kernel/dma/ as it's not only used by
dma-direct but also by dma-iommu, and to keep the code nicely
separated.

Can you give it a go?
