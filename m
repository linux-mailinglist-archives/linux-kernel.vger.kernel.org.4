"CLKREQ#" to match PCIe spec and comments below.

Seems problematic since L1SS can be enabled/disabled at run-time:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-pci?id=v6.2#n420

The simplistic answer is to advertise L1SS support if and only if you
can safely support it.

I don't know why this is an issue for this device but not others.  Is
it because there's some problem in the way the board is designed?  Or
(after skimming the bugzilla) maybe a problem with the plug-in cards?
