Oh, I just meant that this is her second patch submission to the Linux
kernel in general, (the first was [0]), so she likely just accidentally
forgot to address your comments rather than intentionally ignoring them.
Of course, it's good that you highlighted them again here in v3, as they
certainly need to be addressed.

The indentation was correct ;-) The option is actually ":linenos", not
":lineos:". That said, it's a neat option, so thank you for pointing it
out.

Well, that's a bit of a hypothetical problem given that in this case
we're only talking about 6 lines ;-) In any case, I don't really mind
one way or the other, but given that none of the other example
codeblocks in the BPF docs have line numbers, I'd personally err on the
side of not adding them here.

This is alluded to a bit earlier in this document:

"Program" in the context of BPF has a very specific meaning. We need to
improve our documentation on them, but see [1] for a bit more detail.
The TL;DR is that the BPF program is the part that runs in kernel space.
