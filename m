Agreed.

Yes, but now we should define what *one* cycle is. And that it is 
defined
regardless of the mode, because the mode only affects the IO lines. But
a clock cycle refers to the clock line. [coming back to here] And as you
said one cycle is one full clock cycle, it is also independent of the 
dtr
setting.

No they don't need it. Lets take your semper flash and assume it needs
12 latency cycles. SPI-NOR will set ncycles to 12 *regardless of the 
mode
or dtr setting*. The controller then knows we need 12 clock cycles. It 
has
then to figure out how that can be achieved. E.g. if it can only do the
"old" byte programming and is in quad mode, good for it. It will send 6
dummy bytes, which will result in 12 dummy clock cycles, because 1 byte
takes two clock cycles in quad SDR mode. If its in octal mode, send 12
bytes. If its in dual mode, send 3 bytes. Obiously, it cannot be in
single bit mode, because it cannot send 1.5 bytes..

If it's freely programmable, it will just tell the hardware to insert
12 dummy clock cycles.

Ahh, I just saw the semper flash doesn't support DTR at all. Ok then,
makes things even simpler.

Ok.
