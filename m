Right.

As I mentioned earlier, timeout can happen due to an issue with PHY layer
also. In those cases, "dev_err()" is relevant.

And I also agree that absence of the device should not be treated as an
error. But my question is, if you know that the slot is going to be
empty always, why cannot you just disable it in dts?

Even if you make the log "dev_info()" there is the wait time for link up
and I'm sure that you wouldn't want it either.

Thanks,
Mani
