I absolutely disagree. Without Thorsten's tracking, Linus would have no
idea what the status of the kernel is.

Again, I disagree. The whole point of testing release candidates is to get
problems fixed. If issues are not fixed timely, they just pile up on top
of each other and make it difficult to identify new issues (and, in many
cases, to test the kernel in the first place).

I find it quite annoying that problems are identfied, often even in -next,
the patch intoducing them is applied to mainline anyway, and then
it sometimes takes until -rc5 or even later to get the fix applied (even if
the fix has been known for weeks or even months). It sometimes even takes
Linus' intervention to get fixes applied to the upstream kernel. That
really should not be necessary. Telling those who track regressions
to stay away from release candidates is absolutely the wrong thing to do
and would only serve to make release candidates quite pointless.

v6.4-rc1 is a good example. Fixes for all build breakages were published
before the commit window opened, yet at least one of them did not make
it into -rc1. Together with this patch there are now at least two
regressions if -rc1 whch could have been avoided and may impact testability
on affected systems.
