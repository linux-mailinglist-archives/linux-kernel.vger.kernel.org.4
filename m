Do you have an example of what you are saying has been rejected
because I have no clue what you are referring to?

The kernel already has a way to divide up a PCI device into multiple
non-PCI sub-drivers. It's auxiliary_bus. Is that not a "shim"? So why
not use that? From the docs:

 * A key requirement for utilizing the auxiliary bus is that there is no
 * dependency on a physical bus, device, register accesses or regmap suppor=
t.
 * These individual devices split from the core cannot live on the platform=
 bus
 * as they are not physical devices that are controlled by DT/ACPI.  The sa=
me
 * argument applies for not using MFD in this scenario as MFD relies on
 * individual function devices being physical devices.


In the usecases here, they are physical devices because it's the same
devices when Linux is running on the SoC.

It is not the proposal that exposes a bunch of hardware. This device
exposes a bunch of hardware. As you say, it is *beyond the PCI
interface*, so it has zero to do with PCI.

We already support non-discoverable h/w behind a PCI bus. It's called
ISA. There's powerpc DT files in the tree with ISA devices.

What is discoverable? Nothing more than a VID/PID.

Your suggestion is simply use the VID/PID(s) and then the PCI driver
for the card will have all the details that implies. There's a name
for that: board files. Just like we had a single machine ID per board
registered with RMK and the kernel had to contain all the
configuration details for each machine ID. It's not just 1 card here.
This is a chip and I imagine what's used or not used or how the
downstream peripherals are configured all depend on the customer and
their specific designs.

If DT is not used here, then swnodes (DT bindings embedded in the
kernel or platform_data 2.0) will be. It's exactly the same structure
in the kernel. It's still going to be non-PCI drivers for all the sub
devices. The change in the drivers will not be making them PCI
drivers, but simply converting DT APIs to fwnode APIs which is
pointless churn IMO.

Finally, let's not forget the FPGA usecase. We already support DT
overlays for FPGAs. The fact that the FPGA sits behind a PCI interface
is pretty much irrelevant to the problem. There is simply no way the
kernel is going to contain information about what's within the FPGA
image. If not DT, how should we communicate the FPGA configuration to
the kernel?
