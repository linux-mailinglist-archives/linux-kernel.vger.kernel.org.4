I don't think Lukas was suggesting that *you* need to split the
locking up, just that it *should* be split up someday.  To me, that
looks like a project on its own that is beyond the scope of this
particular fix, so I think the pci_lock_rescan_remove() as you have it
here is fine for now.

When you fix up the superfluous "return", go ahead and add my

to your patch.  I assume it's easier for you to shepherd this through
the s390 tree, but let me know if you'd rather that I take it.
