Ah yep of course. So although the flags are written by userspace as part
of the data as a stream of bytes, they're passed to the HV via a
register.

I've had this patch in next for a few days and don't want to rebase it.
So can you send a follow-up patch to fix the flags endianess, with a
nice changelog and comment :)

cheers
