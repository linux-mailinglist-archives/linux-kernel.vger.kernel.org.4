Hello,

Apologies for not replying to this [PATCH] noting that I had sent a
superseding [PATCH v2]. I'll address your comments here anyway, as
they are still applicable and don't touch upon my changes in v2.

I presume you meant "_alarm" attributes instead of "_warning".

First, sorry for any confusion caused by my imprecision in an earlier
reply to Armin when I said that I would filter out sensors that were
"Not Present". In the code, this will take the form of filtering out
sensors with an OperationalStatus of "No Contact".

In the HP_BIOSNumericSensor object, CurrentState and PossibleStates[]
are freeform strings that can and do vary by system. Using them for
threshold-based attributes like _crit, _emergency, and _max isn't
feasible, as they aren't guaranteed to have any particular values.
The only certainty according to that whitepaper I referenced as [1]
is that CurrentState is one of the PossibleStates[].

It's true that for the particular system on which I gathered the
example values below, CurrentState will probably change from "Normal"
to "Caution" at some threshold, etc. Perhaps this sort of sensor is
even present on all HP systems. But finding the thresholds can be
done only indirectly by polling WMI in the background to watch
CurrentState for changes that wouldn't be expected to happen in
normal use. And foreknowledge of PossibleStates[] would be required.

Since CurrentState and PossibleStates[] shouldn't be considered, the
only remaining HP_BIOSNumericSensor property that might be useful for
other hwmon attributes is OperationalStatus. I'll discuss my use of
it and _alarm attributes further below in my response re: _fault.

The PWM sensor type is out because HP_BIOSNumericSensor objects are
read-only.

The humidity type is out for now due to a combination of lack of
hardware and my not wanting to guess how HP would implement a
humidity sensor (unlike voltage and current sensors, for which the
implementation is quite obvious). But assuming hardware exists in the
wild, adding support would be straightforward.

The intrusion type is also out for the same two reasons, in addition
to intrusion sensors being implemented as HP_BIOSStateSensor objects,
which this driver does not deal with. But it could be added given
demand, hardware, and testers.

Does that sufficiently explain my choices?

I agree it seems odd, but that is how HP does it. I'll add a comment
to that effect later on in the code.

Indeed. The documentation says that a fault condition means that the
measurement for a channel shouldn't be trusted. Reading through the
OperationalStatus definitions in [1], I was able to come up with a
plausible reason why literally every single one except for "OK"
carried with it some implication of uncertainty.

Let's go through just the statuses you mentioned. Why should I trust
a "Starting" sensor that doesn't consider itself ready yet? Or a
"Stopping" sensor that isn't stopping at my request? An "In Service"
sensor is being "configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise
administered" - doesn't sound too trustworthy to me. As for
"Completed" (17), it's supposed to be "combined" (by OR-ing, I
assume) with "OK" (2), "Error" (6), or "Degraded" (3), and it's
my clear favorite of the bunch. Try to make those values work and
you'll see why.

At any rate, it sounds like you'd prefer to see a more nuanced
handling of at least fault conditions. So the next version will
signal fault only for what I feel are the more obviously faulty
statuses.

I didn't implement alarm conditions because the documentation just
says that they are chip-determined. Since there is no chip here, the
determination would fall to my poor/blind judgment, with no extra
information coming from WMI about e.g. a "Non-Recoverable Error" to
tell me what kind of error and why it was non-recoverable, etc. And
I'm not altogether comfortable with that. But I'll do it if you like.

Please let me know your thoughts as to whether I should, and more
generally re: what an alarm condition is supposed to mean.

I'll add a comment here that this is how HP does fan RPM sensors.

I can't rule out that HP also does Tachometer fan RPM sensors, but
I'm inclined to wait for sightings in the wild before accommodating
them.

In the same vein, I can't rule out the existence of Air Flow CFM
sensors, but hwmon wouldn't support such sensors anyway, and the code
would remain as is to disambiguate based on units.
