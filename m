I don't think it gets dropped, just improperly delayed.

Yes, but practically speaking two NMIs can't arrive at the exact same instance on
bare metal.  One NMI will always arrive first and get vectored, and then the second
NMI will arrive and be pended.  In a virtual environment, two NMIs that are sent
far apart can arrive together, e.g. if the vCPU is scheduled out for an extended
period of time.  KVM mitigates this side effect by allowing two NMIs to be pending.

The problem here isn't that second the NMI is lost, it's that KVM can't get control
when the first NMI completes (IRETs).  KVM can pend both NMIs and queue the first
for injection/vectoring (set V_NMI_PENDING), but AIUI there is no mechanism (and no
code) to force a VM-Exit on the IRET so that KVM can inject the second NMI.

Santosh's response in v2[*] suggested that hardware would allow KVM to "post" an
NMI while the vCPU is running, but I don't see any code in this series to actually
do that.  svm_inject_nmi() is only called from the vCPU's run loop, i.e. requires
a VM-Exit.

I believe this one is a non-issue.  Like bare metal, KVM only allows one NMI to
be pending if NMIs are blocked.

  static void process_nmi(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
  {
	unsigned limit = 2;

	/*
	 * x86 is limited to one NMI running, and one NMI pending after it.
	 * If an NMI is already in progress, limit further NMIs to just one.
	 * Otherwise, allow two (and we'll inject the first one immediately).
	 */
	if (static_call(kvm_x86_get_nmi_mask)(vcpu) || vcpu->arch.nmi_injected)
		limit = 1;

	vcpu->arch.nmi_pending += atomic_xchg(&vcpu->arch.nmi_queued, 0);
	vcpu->arch.nmi_pending = min(vcpu->arch.nmi_pending, limit);
	kvm_make_request(KVM_REQ_EVENT, vcpu);
  }
