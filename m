This node is needed for active analog temperature sensors.
It has fewer options than the thermocouple, as it only supports
a table to map from voltage to temperature and specifying whether
the measurement is differential or single-ended.

If you did as much as glimpsed at the datasheet you would have
understood.

That's how the rest of the file is written.

The chip uses mv-K, but the binding specifies nv-uK, the driver
translates it into the appropriate unit.

It's pretty obvious that "Table" in a binding refers to the datasheet.
But if you meant datasheet, not binding, you're looking at the wrong
datasheet then.
Also, that's how the rest of the file is written.

You're really clueless, I'll let you figure it out on your own.
Also, that's how the rest of the file is written.

If you really want to use something different, you can submit a
patch later and fix the whole binding however you want.
