Yes I meant NS memory for only NS state of GIC.

I understand your concern about late realisation ðŸ˜„.

Another issue in general I see with reference firmware stack(like
Trusted Firmware in this case) is that the requirements are driven from
the reference platforms which may not have this GIC save/restore
requirement as they are in always on domain and it is then made platform
specific problem in that project which may not be ideal and may result
in somewhat misleading indirectly other firmware developers using it.

Also remember some firmware folks asking about LPI context, I am not sure
if there was any work done in that area.

Fair enough and thanks for refreshing my memory on this.

Hi Florian,

I did little bit digging in the TF-A and found this.
plat_arm_gic_{save,resume}()in plat/arm/common/arm_gicv3.c which I assume
makes it platform specific code and hence not used on any other platform.
I also missed to see this earlier as I explicitly ignored the plat/ directory
assuming it is all platform specific code not shared across.

Not sure if the firmware on your platform is not using that or is it
different firmware altogether or may be TF-A forked before this change.
If it is missing anything, it would be good to get that fixed and look
at ways to generalise it.
