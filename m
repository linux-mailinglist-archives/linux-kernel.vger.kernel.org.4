No, beause having TPM2 hardware doesn't guarantee that your firmware 
enables SHA-2 (which also means this is something that could change with 
firmware updates, which means that refusing to support SHA-1 if the 
SHA-2 banks are enabled could result in an entirely different policy 
being required (and plausibly one that isn't implemented in their 
existing tooling)
