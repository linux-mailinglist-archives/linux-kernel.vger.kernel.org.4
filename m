Hi Ard,

After removing the "-mrelax-relocations=no" option, I noticed that the
linker was relaxing GOT references as absolute references for mov
instructions, even if the symbol was in a high address, as long as I
kept the compile-time base address of the kernel image in the top 2G. I
consulted the "Optimize GOTPCRELX Relocations" chapter in x86-64 psABI,
which stated that "When position-independent code is disabled and foo is
defined locally in the lower 32-bit address space, memory operand in mov
can be converted into immediate operand". However, it seemed that if the
symbol was in the higher 32-bit address space, the memory operand in mov
would also be converted into an immediate operand. If I decreased the
compile-time base address of the kernel image, it would be relaxed as
lea. Therefore, I believe that using "-mrelax-relocations=no" without
"-pie" option is necessary. Is there a way to force the linker to relax
it as lea without using the "-pie" option when linking?

Since all GOT references cannot be omitted, perhaps I should try linking
the kernel with the "-pie" option.

Thanks!
