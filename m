Thanks to andrii's reply, I'll try to simplify the help command.

The original purpose of adding this is that when I use libbpf, libbpf installs
the file in /usr/local by default, and I didn't read the makefile carefully
before, so I need to open the makefile to read the code. Determine which
parameter is used to define the path that I want to customize. The makefile
of the kernel provides a make help instruction, which is much more convenient
to use.
