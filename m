This could be the case. You can consider an "edge device" where it is
necessary to run a RT workload. It might also be useful to run 
non realtime applications on the same system.

Usually the RT task (or more specifically the realtime sensitive loop
of the application) runs entirely on userspace. But i suppose there
could be charges on application startup.

I suppose the more general the solution, the better.

No interruptions to the userspace code (time sensitive code) running on
isolated CPUs: no IPIs, no task switches.

This would make isolated CPUs "second class citizens": it would be nice
to be able to execute non realtime apps on isolated CPUs as well
(think of different periods of time during a day, one where 
more realtime apps are required, another where less 
realtime apps are required).

Concrete example: think of a computer handling vRAN traffic near a 
cell tower. The traffic (therefore amount of processing required
by realtime applications) might vary during the day.

User might want to run containers that depend on good memcg charging
performance on isolated CPUs.
