Hi Frank,

This explains your position on the overlay support and I can
certainly understand it ! Regarding the fact that it would enter
"production", the devices we are talking about are not really
widespread yet? This would be a good opportunity to gather feedback
early and improve the support gradually. We could probably even be able
to support improvements in the overlay code if needed I guess.

Thanks for your honest answer,
