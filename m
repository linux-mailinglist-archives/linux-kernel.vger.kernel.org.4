How does this mechanism stop the host from emulating something outside
the designated region?

On TDX, for instance, the guest page table have a shared/private bit.
Private pages get TDX protections to (among other things) keep the page
contents confidential from the host.  Shared pages can be used for MMIO
and don't have those protections.

If the host goes and tries to flip a page from private->shared, TDX
protections will kick in and prevent it.

None of this requires the guest to tell the host where it expects MMIO
to be located.

I'm not _quite_ sure what "guest initiated" means.  But SEV and TDX
don't require an ioremap hook like this.  So, even if they *are* "guest
initiated", the question still remains how they work without this patch,
or what they are missing without it.

I don't really see the connection.  Even if that series was going
forward (I'm not sure it is) there is no ioremap hook there.  There's
also no guest->host communication in that series.  The guest doesn't
_tell_ the host where the MMIO is, it just declines to run code for
devices that it didn't expect to see.

I'm still rather confused here.
