With the missing spinlock initialisation fixed:

-static struct spinlock idem_lock;
+static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(idem_lock);

this passes basic smoke testing and allows the X13s to boot.

It does not seem to have any significant impact on boot time, but it
avoids some of the unnecessary load attempts as intended:

Before:

         Mods ever loaded       131
     Mods failed on kread       0
Mods failed on decompress       0
  Mods failed on becoming       24
      Mods failed on load       14
        Total module size       12587008
      Total mod text size       5058560
       Failed kread bytes       0
  Failed decompress bytes       0
    Failed becoming bytes       2437992
        Failed kmod bytes       1858992
 Virtual mem wasted bytes       4296984
         Average mod size       96085
    Average mod text size       38615
  Avg fail becoming bytes       101583
  Average fail load bytes       132786

After:

         Mods ever loaded       131
     Mods failed on kread       0
Mods failed on decompress       0
  Mods failed on becoming       4
      Mods failed on load       0
        Total module size       12587008
      Total mod text size       5058560
       Failed kread bytes       0
  Failed decompress bytes       0
    Failed becoming bytes       109776
        Failed kmod bytes       0
 Virtual mem wasted bytes       109776
         Average mod size       96085
    Average mod text size       38615
  Avg fail becoming bytes       27444
