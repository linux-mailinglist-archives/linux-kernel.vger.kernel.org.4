This just says it's adding "indirect regmap support" - there's
nothing here saying that it's some Intel specific thing but it's
quite specific to some IPs.  Perhaps you have some name for this
interface?  You're only adding one user here which isn't helping
make the case that this is something generic.

I can't tell what you're trying to say here.  Are you saying that
this is somehow baked into some FPGA design so that it's memory
mapped with only a few registers showing to the rest of the
system rather than just having a substantial memory mapped
window like is typically used for FPGAs, but someohow this
register window stuff is implemented in the soft IP so people are
just throwng vaugely similar interfaces into a random host mapped
register layout?

Whatever's going on here this clearly isn't a generic
implementation of an indirect register map.
