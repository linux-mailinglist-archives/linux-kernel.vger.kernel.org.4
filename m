Oh, I see. We need to guarantee the userspace VMM can not successfully
set a feature in vmx msr, if KVM does not support it.

Indeed, this change can make sure a feature won't be exposed to L2, if L1
does not have it. But for the feature bits that L1 has, yet cleared from
the vmcs_conf->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high in nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs(),
there's no chance for userspace vmm to reset it again.

Well, I am not suggesting to give userspace vmm such permission(which I believe
is incorrect). And IIUC, vmcs_conf->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high shall serve
as a template to initialize vmx->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high. So maybe we
shall not mask off some features in nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs() at the beginning.

Sorry, why vmx_secondary_exec_control()? Could we just change
nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs() like below:

Note: I did not use "if (cpu_has_vmx_waitpkg())" here, it looks like to
take off one's pants to fart(no offense, just a Chinese old saying meaning
unnecessary acts.:)).

Agreed. BTW, do you know why KVM took pains to do so? I mean, emulation for
L2's vmfunc does not rely on the existance of vmfunc, right? So, for L2,
we can just set vmcs02's SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VMFUNC based on vmcs12. And
for L1, we can just disable it by clearing it in vmx_secondary_exec_control(),
and remove the #UD injection logic from KVM?
