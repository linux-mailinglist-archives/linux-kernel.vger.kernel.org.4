Hi Sean,

I'm back, and I don't have good news. The fix for the missing hyperv TLB flushes has
landed in Linus' tree and I now had the chance to test things outside Azure, in WSL on my
AMD laptop.

There is some seriously weird interaction going on between TDP MMU and Hyper-V, with
or without enlightened TLB. My laptop has 16 vCPUs, so the WSL VM also has 16 vCPUs.
I have hardcoded the kernel to disable enlightened TLB (so we know that is not interfering).
I'm running a Flatcar Linux VM inside the WSL VM using legacy BIOS, a single CPU
and 4GB of RAM.

If I run with `kvm.tdp_mmu=0`, I can boot and shutdown my VM consistently in 20 seconds.

If I run with TDP MMU, the VM boot stalls for seconds at a time in various spots
(loading grub, decompressing kernel, during kernel boot), the boot output feels like
it's happening in slow motion. The fastest I see it finish the same cycle is 2 minutes,
I have also seen it take 4 minutes, sometimes even not finish at all. Same everything,
the only difference is the value of `kvm.tdp_mmu`.

So I would like to revisit disabling tdp_mmu on hyperv altogether for the time being but it
should probably be with the following condition:

  tdp_mmu_enabled = tdp_mmu_allowed && tdp_enabled && !hypervisor_is_type(X86_HYPER_MS_HYPERV)

Do you have an environment where you would be able to reproduce this? A Windows server perhaps
or an AMD laptop?
