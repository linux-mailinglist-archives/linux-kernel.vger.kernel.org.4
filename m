Another important inversion vector is memory reclaim as writeback operations
get trapped in blk-throttle and the system can pile on waiting for clean
pages.

I didn't use the term in a precise manner but yeah both can be problematic.
The former a lot more so.

Yeah, definitely.

Generally true but the specific scenario raised by Jinke is rather unusual
and isn't covered by issue_as_root mechanism as it doesn't promote REQ_SYNC
data writes. Then again, this usually isn't a problem as in most cases dirty
throttling through writeback should stave off severe starvations.

blk-throttle is pretty outdated and kinda broken and separating out sync
writes isn't gonna solve most of its problems. However, it will help in some
cases like the one described by Jinke and can sometimes lessen wider scope
inversions too. Given the partial nature, I don't feel too enthusiastic but
at the same time can't find good reasons to reject either. I don't know. I
don't feel too strong either way.

On a tangential note, I've been thinking about implementing io.max on top of
iocost so that each cgroup can just configure the max % of total device IO
capacity that's allowed for it, which should be a lot easier to use and has
many of the problems already solved.

Thanks.
