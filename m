 Thanks for the pointer.  This has been superseded by commit acd61ffb2f16 
("PCI: Add ACS quirk for Pericom PI7C9X2G switches"), right?  In which 
case it is a match ([12d8:2304]), though the quirk does not trigger here, 
i.e. no message is printed about store-forward mode activation:

pcieport 0000:05:00.0: calling  pci_fixup_pericom_acs_store_forward+0x0/0xba @ 1
pcieport 0000:05:00.0: pci_fixup_pericom_acs_store_forward+0x0/0xba took 0 usecs
[...]

pcieport 0000:06:02.0: pci_fixup_pericom_acs_store_forward+0x0/0xba took 2 usecs

NB I don't know why the quirk for the upstream port (05:00.0) is called 
twice, both via pcieport and via pci.

 We have no IOMMU support for any RISC-V machine at the moment:

config ARCH_RV64I
	[...]
	select SWIOTLB if MMU

and:

software IO TLB: area num 4.
software IO TLB: mapped [mem 0x00000000fb732000-0x00000000ff732000] (64MB)

so IIUC this issue does not apply.  Thank you for your input.
