It sounds like there's someplace the hardware designers specify how
this should work?  Where is that?  "Modern Standby" doesn't mean
anything to me, but maybe there's some spec that covers it?

If it's truly outside the spec, then I don't think Linux should use D3
until we have some standardized way to tell whether it's safe.

Maybe this is the clue we need.  My eyes glaze over when reading that
section, but if we can come up with a commit log that starts with a
sentence from that section and connects the dots all the way to the
platform_pci_power_manageable() implementation, that might be a good
argument that 9d26d3a8f1b0 was a little too aggressive.

I like the fact that v5 ([1] for anybody following along at home) is
very generic:

  @@ bool pci_bridge_d3_possible(struct pci_dev *bridge)
  ...
  +       if (pci_pcie_type(bridge) == PCI_EXP_TYPE_ROOT_PORT &&
  +           !platform_pci_power_manageable(bridge))
  +               return false;

My objection was that we didn't have a clear connection to any specs,
so even though the code is perfectly generic, the commit log mentioned
specific cases (USB keyboard/mouse on xHCI device connected to USB-C
on AMD USB4 router).

But maybe we *could* make a convincing generic commit log.  I guess
we'd also have to explain the PCI_EXP_TYPE_ROOT_PORT part of the
patch.
