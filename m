I don't think the kfunc writers will be able to use KF_OWNED_ARGS vs KF_TRUSTED_ARGS properly.
refcnt-ed or not is not a property that they should worry about.
Let's evaluate this patch set without KF_OWNED_ARGS and bpf_ct_* are still KF_TRUSTED_ARGS
and the other side of the verifier is relaxed to accept non-refcnted PTR_TO_BTF_ID
into kfunc.
What kind of bpf prog will be able to pass 'struct nf_conn___init *' into these bpf_ct_* ?
We've introduced nf_conn___init vs nf_conf specifically to express the relationship
between allocated nf_conn and other nf_conn-s via different types.
Why is this not enough?

I prefer to keep only one flag KF_TRUSTED_ARGS that kfunc-s need to use
and eventually make all kfuncs KF_TRUSTED_ARGS by default and remove that flag.

Separately...
I think there was a plan to strengthen PTR_TO_BTF_ID and apply PTR_UNTRUSTED.
This PTR_WALKED looks like new thing.
If we really need it PTR_TO_BTF_ID should be allowlisted instead of denylisted
as PTR_WALKED is doing.
I mean we can introduce PTR_TRUSTED and add this flag to return value
of bpf_get_current_task_btf() and arguments of tracepoints.
As soon as any ptr walking is done we can clear PTR_TRUSTED to keep
backward compat behavior of PTR_TO_BTF_ID.
PTR_WALKED is sort-of doing the same, but not conservative enough.
Too many things produce PTR_TO_BTF_ID. Auditing it all is challenging.

I might have missed earlier discussions on this patch set. Apologies if so.
