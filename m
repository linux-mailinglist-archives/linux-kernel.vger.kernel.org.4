I think we've been getting distracted by text_poke(). text_poke() does
updates via a different virtual address which introduce new
synchroniation wrinkles, but it's not the main issue.

As _think_ I understand it, the root of the issue is that speculative
execution - and that per Andy, speculative execution doesn't obey memory
barriers.

I have _not_ dug into the details of how retpolines work and all the
spectre stuff that was going on, but - retpoline uses lfence, doesn't
it? And if speculative execution is the issue here, isn't retpoline what
we need?

For this particular issue, I'm not sure "invalidate by filling with
illegal instructions" makes sense. For that to work, would the processor
have to execute a serialize operation and a retry on hitting an illegal
instruction - or perhaps we do in the interrupt handler?

But if filling with illegal instructions does act as a speculation
barrier, then the issue is that a torn read could generate a legal but
incorrect instruction.
