That's pretty much it. The DISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING is to disable it in
various places where it will crash if used (vdso is one of them). It is
also used to prevent the code that declares it from recursing on itself (as
you stated).

Thus, the issue is simply that the declaration is hidden by the recursion
protection where the function is actually defined.
