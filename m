I agree that for this .isra.<num> issue and later static functions
with different signature issue, global view is needed to make
proper decision.

I am not sure about this. We should keep a good default to handle
.isra functions as we discussed earlier. If user still wants
to kprobe a .isra function which is filtered out by our default
handling, user can use addr instead, in which case, user needs
to check dwarf output and/or assembly to make sure they understand
how many arguments are actually used and how they are used.

Could be as you explained below. Also, the original behavior for static 
function with one thread seems wrong. User only find one static function
definition in BTF and may assume it is the one user expected. But this 
may not be the case since other same-name static functions may be
simply ignored.

Removing these inconsistent static functions could be a simpler
approach. To really resolve this issue, BTF needs to encode more
information, e.g., DW_AT_low_pc, so this function can be related to a 
particular ksym. We could extend BTF somehow to encode this information.
One possible is to utilize the btf_decl_tag. For same-name static
functions, we could have
     btf_decl_tag("static_func:name:<low_pc_1>") -> foo (first static 
func in btf)
     btf_decl_tag("static_func:name:<low_pc_2>") -> foo (second static 
func in btf)
We only need to do this for static functions which have same names.

In verifier, we could build the above relationship and establish
    btf_id for first foo -> low_pc_1
    btf_id for second foo -> low_pc_2
so verifier can then find the correct ksym addr for a particular
btf_id for 'foo'.

If I understand correctly, for same-name static functions,
we would like compare # of parameters
first. If they are the same, we then compare parameter names.
<name>.isra.<num> functions will compare against <name> func
to ensure the number of parameters the same. I am not 100%
sure what is the difference between the above two approaches.
Only implementation difference, right?
