Yes, probably.  But then when write happens it'll be done there when split,
so the overhead was delayed.

Meanwhile I'll retest again (probably tomorrow..) with bare metals with THP
on/off to double check.

Muhammad, do you think the current performance will work for you?

Especially I want to double check with you again on whether
XFS/EXT4/... will be needed for the tracking purpose so you can reply here
together.  We shouldn't merge anything that doesn't have at least one
existing good use case, and we may need to rethink if it's not.

For performance, one approach is probably making uffd-wp async separate
from other features, where we can revert the meaning of uffd-wp bit to
mimic what soft-dirty does (I think this will look closer to what David
mentioned in the other thread), by defining uffd-wp=1 as "written" and
uffd-wp=0 as clean.

IIUC that'll make it one bit and work as fast as soft-dirty, meanwhile all
uffd-wp marker things can hopefully still be maintained.  However I really
don't like it to violate a lot of things, e.g., when UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT
another round we'll need to DROP uffd-wp if async, but APPLY uffd-wp if
sync...  So in general it'll need more thoughts and slower to do.
