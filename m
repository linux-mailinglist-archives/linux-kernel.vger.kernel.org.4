Good, because my question is specifically about *hotpluggable*
displays/panels like the upcoming DSC support for DP.  After all there
would be no point in me suggesting to connect and disconnect
non-hotpluggable displays and expect something sensible to happen,
wouldn't it?  Allow me to copy-paste the question again for convenience,
with some minor wording changes:

	However, if I connect a DSC DP display, then disconnect it (now the
	register should be non-zero, but cfg->dsc will be zero), and then
	connect and reconnect a non-DSC DP display multiple times, it'll get
	flushed every time because we never clear CTL_DSC_FLUSH after that?

And the missing part is: would multiple flushes be harmful in this case?

I don't mind when and where this lands, just want to have the semantics
clear around persisting the value of CTL_DSC_FLUSh in the register.

Regardless, this patch doesn't sound like a fix but a workaround until
reset_intf_cfg() is fixed to be called at the right point, and extended
to clear CTL_DSC_ACTIVE and flush the DSCs.  Perhaps it shouldn't have a
Fixes: tag for that reason, as you intend to reinstate this
if (cfg->dsc) condition when that is done?
