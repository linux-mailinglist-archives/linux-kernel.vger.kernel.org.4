Hi Masami,

Thanks for writing this up. I have a few suggestions and some small
grammar nits, please see below.

s/cause unexpected/cause an unexpected

Starting off this paragraph with a few sentences describing the
high-level purpose of the macro may be useful here as well.

> +which is NOT error injectable. Thus, you (and reviewers) must ensure;

IMO the wording in the "...this can cause unexpected kernel crash if you
allow error injection on the function which is NOT error injectable"
part of the sentence could be improved. The function is error
injectable, so saying the kernel could crash if you allow error
injection on a function that's not error injectable is a bit confusing.
What about something like this for the whole sentence?

Because function-level error injection may forcibly change a function's
return value, a function that enables it may return an error _any_ time
it returns a value, including if it is invoked with expected parameters
and under proper conditions. This means that you must _always_ ensure
the following requirements are met in orer to avoid a kernel crash:

> +
> +- The function returns an error code if it fails, and the callers must check

I'm a bit confused by the first part of this sentence. The point is that
we're overriding the returned error code, right? What about something
like this:

Callers must always check for errors on every invocation of an
error-injectable function, and must safely recover if any error is
observed.

small nit: s/get a lock/acquire a lock

Also, the presence of this caveat suggests to me that this second bullet
should possibly be rephrased in general:
>(if those are recovered before returning error, that will be OK.)

If I understand correctly, the larger point is that the caller should
never observe any side effects when calling an error-injectable function
if that function returns an error, correct? The caller expecting that
the function will always change some state before its first return
statement is definitely a violation of that, but I think it could apply
to other parts of the function as well.

What do you think about this:

An error-injectable function should never leak any observable state to
the caller if an error is returned, and the caller should never rely on
some state always being changed when the function is called. For
example, it would be a bug if a function ever returned -EBUSY with a
lock held, or if the caller assumed that a global counter would always
be incremented. Other examples of improper state change visibility
include writing to a pointer argument without restoring the original
value on any error path, enabling or disabling preemption or IRQs,
flushing a buffer, etc.

I don't quite understand why release functions would be different than
calling any other error-injectable kernel function that needs to clean
up state, but I readily admit that I may be missing some context. Also,
such functions are typically void anyways, no? So wouldn't they usually
be less of a pain? Again, apologies if I'm missing context here.

I would personally scrap this part, but it's up to you. I think it's all
well captured in the second bullet-point already.

I would consider removing the second two sentences in this paragraph.
We're working in the kernel, so being careful should be the baseline no
matter what you're doing. Also, it seems fairly clear that choosing the
wrong error-return type could cause a crash, unspecified behavior, etc.

s/4 types of errors/4 return types

I realize that we've been using 'error types' up to now for error
injection, but IMO it's really return types that we're concerned with.
Feel free to ignore if you disagree.

s/can not access to the address/cannot dereference it

or just drop everything after "is not an object address". If it's not an
address, you probably shouldn't be accessing it :-) (modulo masking out
flags, etc).
