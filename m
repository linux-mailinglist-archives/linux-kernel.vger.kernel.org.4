Good question, I'm not 100% sure on the background myself. It seems
since some devices have restrictions on how large a mapping they can
handle in a single run, we should not hand out single scatterlist
elements longer than that.

It is still a contiguous buffer, but some drivers forget to set their
mapping limits and also only check the number of elements == 1 to determine
if a sg is contiguous (which is not correct as there is no rule that
contiguous runs must be merged into a single scatterlist). For those
driver this would be an issue (I've only found one such case in-tree and
sent a fix, https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220825162609.14076-1-afd@ti.com/)

I'm not sure it is worth the risk today either, but figured this being a
young enough exporter it could be a good spot to start with for exposing
misbehaving drivers vs some legacy GPU driver exporter. Plus better to
make this change now rather than later in any case.

I don't have any strong reason for this yet though, so I'm find with
just considering this patch an RFC for now.

Thanks,
Andrew
