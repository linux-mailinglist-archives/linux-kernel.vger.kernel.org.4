I don't see why you keep saying this. It is centered around the struct
vfio_device object in the kernel, which is definately NOT the VM.

The struct vfio_device is the handle for the hypervisor to control
the physical assigned device - and it is the hypervisor that controls
the migration.

We do not need the hypervisor userspace to have a handle to the hidden
controlling function. It provides no additional functionality,
security or insight to what qemu needs to do. Keeping that
relationship abstracted inside the kernel is a reasonable choice and
is not "fundamentally broken".

If they are the same driver implementing vfio_device you may be able
to claim they conceptually exist, but it is pretty artificial to draw
this kind of distinction inside a single driver.

I agree people may want to do this, but it is very unclear how SRIOV
live migration can help do this.

SRIOV live migration is all about not disturbing the kernel driver,
assuming it is the same kernel driver on both sides. If you have two
different kernel's there is nothing worth migrating. There isn't even
an assurance the dma API will have IOMMU mapped the same objects to
the same IOVAs. eg so you have re-establish your admin queue, IO
queues, etc after migration anyhow.

Let alone how to solve the security problems of allow userspace to
load arbitary FW blobs into a device with potentially insecure DMA
access..

At that point it isn't really the same kind of migration.
