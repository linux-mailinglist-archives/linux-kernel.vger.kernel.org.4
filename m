The component framework itself doesn't rely on DT in any way. By
providing a appropriate match function you can make it work with any
kind of device. In fact etnaviv supports platform devices instantiated
via board code today. They don't need to come from DT.

If we could make the PCI stuff work the same way, that would be my
preferred option.

That isn't the issue solved by the component framework. On the existing
SoCs all the hardware is available when the driver is probed. The
component framework just makes sure that we only expose the DRM device
after all GPU cores that should be managed by a single DRM device
instance are probed.

One could easily image a PCI device that containing a 2D and a 3D
Vivante GPU that should be made available through a single DRM device.
In that case you'll also need to use the component framework.

But they surely should not all be made available through the etnaviv
driver. Etnaviv deals with the Vivante GPUs. If you have a PCI device
with multiple IP cores behind the shared MMIO space you should have a
PCI driver instantiating platform devices so the respective drivers for
those IP cores can bind to the platform device. Etnaviv is not that
driver.
