Lemme add Rostedt.

So now we have libtraceevent and here's an example how to do it:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-trace-devel/patch/20221021182345.092cdb50@gandalf.local.home/
https://www.trace-cmd.org/Documentation/libtracefs/libtracefs-kprobes.html

Reportedly, rasdaemon is still using the old libtraceevent method. So it
probably should be updated to use the new library version.

From looking at the examples, I think the new libtraceevent should be
able to handle all that just fine.

Yeah, no. Let's get this one to work pls.

trace_mce_record2() looks like the old attempts to design a syscall
better. :)

Syncing with other components is always a stretch. You're forgetting how
distros lag behind and don't always have the needed resources to update
their userspace.

Or they can't update because of enterprise raisins.

So no, it is not trivial, trust me. It's a bunch of politics and effort.

Until that new tracepoint becomes insufficient in the future and we need
to add trace_mce_record3(). No, you don't want that. :)

Thx.
