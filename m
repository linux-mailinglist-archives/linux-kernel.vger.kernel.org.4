Oh? Is this an old MSI PH61 mainboard or is this an add-in pcie card
(found something on amazon with that name and rev too)?

If it's an add-in pcie card, could it be that the EEPROM chip on it
is (getting) a bit wonky? Or do you have a really fast machine?
(Latest crop of i7/i9 Alder/Raptor Lake or Ryzen 5000/7000 Series)

There's also Renesas loader code floating around on github.

Yes, I was talking about "K2026090.mem". I didn't know this version existed,
but Vinod knew about it:
https://patches.linaro.org/project/linux-arm-msm/patch/20200113084005.849071-5-vkoul@kernel.org/

Looking on google leads to startech.com and they have/had this as a product:
https://www.startech.com/en-de/cards-adapters/pciusb3s22

The K2026090.mem Firmware file is in the "[renesas upd72020x] firmware update.zip"
(see in the "RE202.A10" folder).

I don't know how it works with pcie cards that are supposed to have the firmware
stored on the EEPROM chip. In my case of the WNDR4700 - there is no extra chip and
the driver has to upload the firmware - I just have to put the file renamed as
renesas_usb_fw.mem into /lib/firmware/ and it works.

Christian
