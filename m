You either need to develop and maintain a complex system-wide LSM
policy or you need a security model that is specifically tuned and
then scoped to the needs of the workload running on behalf of the
kernel as a UID=0 userspace process.

As I noted in my e-mail to Roberto, our TSEM LSM brings forward the
ability to do both, as a useful side effect of the need to limit model
complexity when the objective is to have a single functional
description of the security state of a system.

As I noted above, TSEM brings the ability to provide highly specific
and narrowly scoped security policy to a process heirarchy
ie. workload.

However, regardless of the technology applied, in order to pursue
Roberto's UMD model of having a uid=0 process run tasks on behalf of
the kernel, there would seem to be a need to define what the security
objectives are.

From the outside looking in, there would seem to be a need to address
two primary issues:

1: Trust/constrain what the UMD process can do.

2: Constrain what the system at large can do to the UMD process.

As we have seen before, requirement 1 implies a definition of what it
means for a process to be 'trusted'.

In the absence of formal verification, which appears to be a
non-starter in practice, this would seem to imply defining a standard
for the allowed security behavior of the UMD workload.

From our perspective, with TSEM, we define 'trusted' for a workload to
mean that it has not requested a security behavior inconsistent with
what the workload has been unit tested to.  If a process does this, its
ability to execute additional security behaviors is curtailed.

With respect to requirement two.

Here is the ASCII art diagram of Roberto's proposed system:

     r/w  ^                             kernel space
----------|-----------------------------------------
          v (pipe)                        user space
 +-----------------+       +-----------------------+
 | trustworthy UMD |---X---| rest of the processes |
 +-----------------+       +-----------------------+

Casey noted that he believed the Linux LSM had sufficient coverage to
provide the necessary security controls for this model.  He
specifically mentioned that it had support for network traffic
controls and labeling.

I haven't seen a reply from Roberto to my e-mail questioning what the
following means:

---X---

But I get the sense that it means that any other process in userspace
couldn't have any impact, or I assume visibility, into what the UID=0
process is doing on behalf of the kernel.  I don't think it means that
there is supposed to be some type of highly controlled traffic between
the UMD and other processes.

We will see what comments Roberto has on this.

This arguably may be the most difficult requirement to meet if our
interpretation of this requirement is correct, particularly so if this
involves a confidentiality requirement, perhaps a bit less so if there
is only a requirement of integrity of execution.

As I mentioned in a previous e-mail, depending on the requirements,
issue 2 starts to look a lot like protected enclave technologies such
as SGX.  As history has shown, providing a protected execution
environment, against the rest of the system, is a somewhat formidable
undertaking, with probably a requirement for hardware support if SGX
and/or TDX are any examples.

So, I believe that TSEM brings useful technology to the table, but
regardless of technology, it would seem there is a need to
specifically define the security requirements for the UMD model.
