Thanks for detailed explanation! Now I agree you have actually covered all
the cases. But since EXT4_BOOT_LOADER_INO has this special behavior maybe
it would be more robust to create a special iget flag for it? Like
EXT4_IGET_BAD? And only with this flag we'd be returning bad inode from
ext4_iget(), otherwise we always return the error code?
