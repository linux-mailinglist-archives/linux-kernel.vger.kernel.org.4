This is all in general terms, though.

I think that Daniel has been asking for a specific example, because if
a new sysfs i/f is added with a certain issue in mind and then it
turns out to be never used by anyone, because the issue is theoretical
or not severe enough for anyone to care, it is a pure maintenance
burden.  It would be good to have at least some assurance that this
will not be the case.

Daniel, even if you think that the hardware in question is
misdesigned, Linux has a long record of supporting misdesigned
hardware, so this wouldn't be the first time ever.  However, I do
agree that it would be good to have a specific example supporting this
case.
