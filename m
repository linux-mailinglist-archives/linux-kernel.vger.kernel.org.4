Per our offlist chat, my understanding is that there are caveats with vPMUs=
 that
it's simply not feasible for a hypervisor to handle.  I.e. virtualizing any=
 x86
PMU with 100% accuracy isn't happening anytime soon.

The way forward is likely to evaluate each caveat on a case-by-case basis t=
o
determine whether or not the cost of the fixup in KVM is worth the benefit =
to
the guest.  E.g. emulating "CPUID instructions retired" seems like it would=
 be
fairly straightforward.  AFAICT, fixing up the VMRUN stuff is quite difficu=
lt though.
