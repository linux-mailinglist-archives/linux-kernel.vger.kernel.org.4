FWIW there is a capability bit and enable bit in the PASID cap/control
registers that says whether a device can/should add a PASID to a
translated request or not.  I think the intent is that a host can
sanity check AT requests to make sure the device isn't making them
up. To do that it needs the PASID.  Not sure any hosts do this yet
though ;)

Not worth much, but I thought it always sent the PASID so dug out spec
to check (I was wrong as it is both optional and configurable).
