Did you read that thread until the end?

So lemme ask this again because the last time it all sounded weird and I
don't think it got clarified fully: you cannot have more than one memory
controller type at the same time on those systems, can you?

Because if you can and you want to support that, the current EDAC
"design" allows to have only a single EDAC driver per system. So you
can't do two drivers now.

If your answer to that is

Subject: [PATCH RESEND v3 13/17] EDAC/mc: Add MC unique index allocation procedure

then I'm sceptical but I'd need to look at that first.

And reading your commit messages, you're talking a lot about what you're
doing. But that should be visible from the patch. What I wanna read is
*why* you're doing it.

Like in this patch above, what's that "unique index allocation
procedure" for?

edac_mc_alloc() already gets a mc_num as the MC number.

And yes, if you want to do multiple driver instances like x86 does per
NUMA node instances, then that is done with edac_mc_alloc() which gives
you a memory controller descriptor and then you can deal with those.

From all the text it sounds to me you want to add a separate driver for
that Zynq A05 thing but I might still be missing something...
