Hi all, apologies on the confusion about the litmus test.
I should have explained it better but it seems you mostly figured it out.
As Alan said I'm tricking a little bit by not unlocking in certain 
places to filter out all executions that aren't what I'm looking for.
I didn't have much time when I sent it (hence also the lack of 
explanation and why I haven't responded earlier), so I didn't have time 
to play around with the filter feature to do this the "proper"/non-cute way.
As such it really isn't about deadlocks.

I think one question is whether the distinction between the models could 
be reproduced without using any kind of filtering at all.
I have a feeling it should be possible but I haven't had time to think 
up a litmus test that does that.

Note as Andrea said that po-unlock-lock-po is generally not in mb (and 
also not otherwise in fence).
Only po-unlock-lock-po;[After-unlock-lock];po is in mb (resp. ...&int in 
fence).
While the example uses smp_mb__after_unlock_lock, the anomaly should 
generally cover any extended fences.

I see now. Somehow I thought stores must execute in program order, but I 
guess it doesn't make sense.
In that sense, W ->xbstar&int X always means W propagates to X's CPU 
before X executes.

This misses the property of release stores that any po-earlier store 
must also execute before the release store.
Perhaps it could be changed to the oldÂ  po-rel | [M] ; (xbstar & int) ; 
[Release] but then one could instead move this into the definition of 
cumul-fence.
In fact you'd probably want this for all the propagation fences, so 
cumul-fence and pb should be the right place.

You could do it, by turning the relation into one massive recursive 
definition.

Thinking about what the options are:
1) accept the difference and run with it by making it consistent inside 
the axiomatic model
2) fix it through the recursive definition, which seems to be quite ugly 
but also consistent with the power operational model as far as I can tell
3) weaken the operational model... somehow
4) just ignore the anomaly
5) ???

Currently my least favorite option is 4) since it seems a bit off that 
the reasoning applies in one specific case of LKMM, more specifically 
the data race definition which should be equivalent to "the order of the 
two races isn't fixed", but here the order isn't fixed but it's a data race.
I think the patch happens to almost do 1) because the xbstar&int at the 
end should already imply ordering through the prop&int <= hb rule.
What would remain is to also exclude rcu-fence somehow.

2) seems the most correct choice but also to complicate LKMM a lot.

Seems like being between a rock and hard place.

Sorry, I collapsed some cases. I'll show an example. I think all the 
other cases are the same.
Let's pick an edge that links two events with ww-vis through
 Â  w-post-bounded ; vis ; w-pre-bounded
where the vis comes from
 Â  cumul-fence* ; rfe? ; [Marked] ;
 Â Â Â  (strong-fence ; [Marked] ; xbstar)Â  <= vis
and the w-pre-bounded came from po-unlock-lock-po;[After-unlock-lock];po 
but not po-unlock-lock-po & int.

Note that such po-unlock-lock-po;[After-unlock-lock];po must come from
 Â  po-rel ; rfe ; acq-po

So we have
 Â  w-post-bounded ;Â  cumul-fence* ; rfe? ; [Marked] ;
 Â Â Â Â  strong-fence ; [Marked] ; xbstar ; po-rel ; rfe ; acq-po
<=
 Â  w-post-bounded ;Â  cumul-fence* ; rfe? ; [Marked] ;
 Â Â Â Â  strong-fence ; [Marked] ; xbstar ; hb ; hb ;Â  acq-po
<=
 Â  w-post-bounded ;Â  cumul-fence* ; rfe? ; [Marked] ;
 Â Â Â Â  strong-fence ; [Marked] ; xbstar ;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  fence
<= ww-vis

All the other cases where w-pre-bounded are used have the shape
 Â Â Â  ... ; xbstar ; w-pre-bounded
which can all be handled in the same manner.
