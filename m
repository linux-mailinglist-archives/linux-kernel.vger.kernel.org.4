Hello Martin,

I apologize for the delayed response as I was on vacation without email
access. I hope this is not a problem.

To be honest, I have prepared A1 peripherals and A1 PLL drivers based on very
poor Amlogic datasheets and custom 4.19-based vendor drivers.
The vendor driver has an AUDDDS clock in the PLL clock part, but it is not
used anywhere. Unfortunately, as usual, the datasheet doesn't provide any
information or explanation about what it is. However, the driver has a few
lines of comments that indicate:

    /*
     * aud dds clock is not pll clock, not divider clock,
     * No clock model can describe it.
     * So we regard it as a gate, and the gate ops
     * should realize lonely.
     */

Additionally, the vendor driver states that AUDDDS has a 49Mhz clock,
but I do not see any relationship with other clocks (including the exported
GENCLK).
Jian did not include it in the first version of the PLL driver, and I have
decided not to change it either.

I also noticed a few lines of AUDDDS initialization sequences in the vendor
driver, which may affect CPU clock objects (from my point of view).
However, they are currently under development, and I will try to figure it
out with Amlogic support.

Actually, AUDDDS has an xtal2dds parent clock, and if we need to have
the AUDDDS clock in the PLL driver, we should add one more link between
peripherals and PLL drivers.

Let me know if you have any questions.
