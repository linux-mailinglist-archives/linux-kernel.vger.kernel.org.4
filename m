I believe it is used by a few vendors (Nvidia, Intel, Dell, etc).
I have seen EDR related messages in some of the posted DPC related
dmesg logs.

I don't think we will get spurious EDR notifications. Since the only
stale entry is in DEVSTA status register, the user will at most see
errors bits set, even after successful recovery. However, if the user
relies on some automation scripts to check the device status after
error recovery, it may have an impact.

Ok. IMO, since it will be visible to the user (although not fatal),
we can send it to the stable. But I will let you decide on it.

In the PCIe firmware specification v3.3, table "Table 4-6: Interpretation of
the _OSC Control Field, Returned Value", field "PCI Express Downstream Port
Containment configuration control", it explains that the firmware can use
EDR notification only when OS DPC control is not requested or denied by
firmware.

We also call pci_aer_raw_clear_status() in dpc_process_error() which also
should clear the fatal and non-fatal errors.

So the idea is to get the error info in a particular format using
something like _DSM call? What about the legacy use case? For legacy
firmware, we still need to support the old format, right?

Something similar to updating struct aer_stats and struct aer_err_src?

Agree. It would require changes to firmware spec, AER and DPC driver.
Maybe we can start with cleaning up the native mode first. I would be
happy to contribute to it. Let me think about the possible methods
and get back to you.
