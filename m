I hate this generic blabber about "more flexible".  There's a *REASON*
it's more flexible, so let's talk about the reasons, please.

It's really something like this, right?

	The TDX module design allows it to be updated while the system
	is running.  The update procedure shares quite a few steps with
	this "on demand" loading mechanism.  The hope is that much of
	this "on demand" mechanism can be shared with a future "update"
	mechanism.  A boot-time TDX module implementation would not be
	able to share much code with the update mechanism.

There are a lot of words in there.

3) Loading the TDX module requires VMX to be enabled.  Currently, only
   the kernel KVM code mucks with VMX enabling.  If the TDX module were
   to be initialized separately from KVM (like at boot), the boot code
   would need to be taught how to muck with VMX enabling and KVM would
   need to be taught how to cope with that.  Making KVM itself
   responsible for TDX initialization lets the rest of the kernel stay
   blissfully unaware of VMX.

As opposed to concurrent calls from one caller? ;)

This would actually be a nice place to call out the SEAMCALL names and
mention that each of these steps involves a set of SEAMCALLs.

You might want to more precisely define "boot-time present CPUs".  The
boot of *what*?

Are these part of the ABI or just a purely OS-side construct?

Again, there are a lot of words in that comment, but I'm not sure why
it's here.  Despite all the whinging about ACPI, doesn't it boil down to:

	The TDX module itself establishes its own concept of how many
	logical CPUs there are in the system when it is loaded.  The
	module will reject initialization attempts unless the kernel
	runs TDX initialization code on every last CPU.

	Ensure that the kernel is able to run code on all known logical
	CPUs.

and these checks are just to see if the kernel has shot itself in the
foot and is *KNOWS* that it is currently unable to run code on some
logical CPU?

Why check for -ENODEV exclusively?  Is there some other error nonzero
code that indicates success?

"Shut it down" seems wrong here.  That could be interpreted as "I have
already shut it down".  "Shutting down" seems better.

I honestly don't think all these error codes mean anything.  They're
plumbed nowhere and the use of -EFAULT is just plain wrong.

Nobody can *DO* anything with these anyway.

Just give one error code and make sure that you have pr_info()'s around
to make it clear what went wrong.  Then just do -EINVAL universally.
Remove all the nonsense comments.

TDX_MODULE_NONE should probably be called TDX_MODULE_NOT_LOADED.  A
comment would also be nice:

I don't get what that default: is for or what it has to do with
TDX_MODULE_SHUTDOWN.
