+/**
+ * atc_get_llis_residue - Get residue for a hardware linked list transfer
+ *
+ * Calculate the residue by removing the length of the child descriptors already
+ * transferred from the total length. To get the current child descriptor we can
+ * use the value of the channel's DSCR register and compare it against the value
+ * of the hardware linked list structure of each child descriptor.
+ *
+ * The CTRLA register provides us with the amount of data already read from the
+ * source for the current child descriptor. So we can compute a more accurate
+ * residue by also removing the number of bytes corresponding to this amount of
+ * data.
+ *
+ * However, the DSCR and CTRLA registers cannot be read both atomically. Hence a
+ * race condition may occur: the first read register may refer to one child
+ * descriptor whereas the second read may refer to a later child descriptor in
+ * the list because of the DMA transfer progression inbetween the two reads.
+ *
+ * One solution could have been to pause the DMA transfer, read the DSCR and
+ * CTRLA then resume the DMA transfer. Nonetheless, this approach presents some
+ * drawbacks:
+ * - If the DMA transfer is paused, RX overruns or TX underruns are more likey
+ *   to occur depending on the system latency. Taking the USART driver as an
+ *   example, it uses a cyclic DMA transfer to read data from the Receive
+ *   Holding Register (RHR) to avoid RX overruns since the RHR is not protected
+ *   by any FIFO on most Atmel SoCs. So pausing the DMA transfer to compute the
+ *   residue would break the USART driver design.
+ * - The atc_pause() function masks interrupts but we'd rather avoid to do so
+ * for system latency purpose.
+ *
+ * Then we'd rather use another solution: the DSCR is read a first time, the
+ * CTRLA is read in turn, next the DSCR is read a second time. If the two
+ * consecutive read values of the DSCR are the same then we assume both refers
+ * to the very same child descriptor as well as the CTRLA value read inbetween
+ * does. For cyclic tranfers, the assumption is that a full loop is "not so
+ * fast". If the two DSCR values are different, we read again the CTRLA then the
+ * DSCR till two consecutive read values from DSCR are equal or till the
+ * maximum trials is reach. This algorithm is very unlikely not to find a stable
+ * value for DSCR.
+ * @atchan: pointer to an atmel hdmac channel.
+ * @desc: pointer to the descriptor for which the residue is calculated.
+ * @residue: residue to be set to dma_tx_state.
+ * Returns 0 on success, -errno otherwise.
