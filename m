If the mmio space is behind a PCI device, then why isn't that a special
bus type for that "pci-mmio" or something, right?  Otherwise what
happens when you yank out that PCI device?  Does that work today for
these platform devices?

Fair enough :)

platfom bus should be for DT/ACPI devices like that, but that's not what
a "hang a DT off a PCI device" should be, right?  Why is mmio space
somehow special here?  Perhaps we just add support for that to the aux
bus?

USB4 is really just pci, ignore the "USB" term :)

Then those drivers need to be tweaked to support the new bus type, but
that can't be a platform device hanging off of a USB device as that
makes no sense...
