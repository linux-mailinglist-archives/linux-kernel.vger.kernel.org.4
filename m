I've been thinking about this some more, and this justification for
making it per-object no longer makes sense to me.

A shadow variable should follow the lifetime of its associated data
object, so the only way it would leak from an unloaded patched module
would be if there's a bug either in the patched module or in the
livepatch itself, right?

Or did I misunderstand your point?
