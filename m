From: Like Xu <likexu@tencent.com>

The pebs capability on the SPR is basically the same as Ice Lake Server
with the exception of two special facilities that have been enhanced and
require special handling.

Upon triggering a PEBS assist, there will be a finite delay between the
time the counter overflows and when the microcode starts to carry out
its data collection obligations. Even if the delay is constant in core
clock space, it invariably manifest as variable "skids" in instruction
address space.

On the Ice Lake Server, the Precise Distribution of Instructions Retire
(PDIR) facility mitigates the "skid" problem by providing an early
indication of when the counter is about to overflow. On SPR, the PDIR
counter available (Fixed 0) is unchanged, but the capability is enhanced
to Instruction-Accurate PDIR (PDIR++), where PEBS is taken on the
next instruction after the one that caused the overflow.

SPR also introduces a new Precise Distribution (PDist) facility only on
general programmable counter 0. Per Intel SDM, PDist eliminates any
skid or shadowing effects from PEBS. With PDist, the PEBS record will
be generated precisely upon completion of the instruction or operation
that causes the counter to overflow (there is no "wait for next occurrence"
by default).

In terms of KVM handling, when guest accesses those special counters,
the KVM needs to request the same index counters via the perf_event
kernel subsystem to ensure that the guest uses the correct pebs hardware
counter (PRIR++ or PDist). This is mainly achieved by adjusting the
event precise level to the maximum, where the semantics of this magic
number is mainly defined by the internal software context of perf_event
and it's also backwards compatible as part of the user space interface.

Opportunistically, refine confusing comments on TNT+, as the only
ones that currently support pebs_ept are Ice Lake server and SPR (GLC+).
