Not keen on this. Does the cedrus HW even have support for multiple planes?
I suspect not, in which case the driver shouldn't suggest that it can do that.

Now, if the hardware *can* support this, then there is an argument to be made
for the cedrus driver to move to the multiplanar API before moving it out
of staging to allow such future enhancements.

Note that you have to choose whether to support single or multiplanar, you
can't support both at the same time.

So the decision to move to multiplanar should be led by the HW capabilities.

And Chromium really needs to support non-multiplanar formats as well. I'm
really surprised to hear that it doesn't, to be honest.
