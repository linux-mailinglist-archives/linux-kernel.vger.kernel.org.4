I still do not agree with this statement.  The device tree overlay
implementation is very incomplete and should not be used until it
becomes more complete.  No need to debate this right now, but I don't want
to let this go unchallenged.

If there is no base system device tree on an ACPI based system, then I
am not convinced that a mixed ACPI / device tree implementation is
good architecture.  I might be more supportive of using a device tree
description of a PCI device in a detached device tree (not linked to
the system device tree, but instead freestanding).  Unfortunately the
device tree functions assume a single system devicetree, with no concept
of a freestanding tree (eg, if a NULL device tree node is provided to
a function or macro, it often defaults to the root of the system device
tree).  I need to go look at whether the flag OF_DETACHED handles this,
or if it could be leveraged to do so.
