As we know these developers are claiming to be from a company that we
can not confirm they are actually working for, no, we can't take their
contributions as that goes against the DCO (anonymous contributions).

That would be great, but so far no one that I have contacted from ZTE
has been able to confirm that these are actually ZTE developers.

That would be the best thing for them to do, and would solve the problem
for everyone at their company.  Hopefully that happens soon.
