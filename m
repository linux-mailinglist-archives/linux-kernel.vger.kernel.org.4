I've been discussing this with a few folks here. I think FWIW general
feeling here is that demoting from top tier nodes is preferred, except
in extreme circumstances we would indeed like to run with a
performance issue rather than OOM a customer VM. I wonder if there is
another way to debug mis-tiered pages rather than trigger an oom to
debug.

One thing I think/hope we can trivially agree on is that proactive
reclaim/demotion is _not_ an extreme circumstance. I would like me or
someone from the team to follow up with a patch that disables fallback
to reclaim on proactive reclaim/demotion (sc->proactive).

This makes sense to me.
