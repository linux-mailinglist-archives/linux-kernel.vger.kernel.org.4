I'm aware that 2/7 is where you make the DM change to disallow unknown
flags, what I'm saying is I don't see a reason for that change.

Certainly doesn't look to be a requirement for everything else in that
patch.

So send a separate patch, but I'm inclined to _not_ accept it because
it does potentially break some userspace.

Nothing specific about code, was just a general reminder (based on how
terse the 2/7 header was).
