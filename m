Yes, exactly. I will update above paragraph like below

The PCIe fabric routes Memory Requests based on the TLP address, ignoring
the PASID. In order to prevent Memory Requests with PASID, which should
always be routed to the RC, from being mistakenly routed as peer-to-peer
requests, commit 201007ef707a ("PCI: Enable PASID only when ACS RR & UF
enabled on upstream path") requires some ACS features being supported on
device's upstream path when enabling PCI/PASID.

Never mind. It's really a good chance for me to learn how to describe
this from the perspective of the PCI subsystem.. :-)

Yes.

Above has been answered by Vasant Hegde in a separated reply.
