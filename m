Ahah, it turns out that liburing-dev isn't installed on the test fleet,
so fstests didn't get built with io_uring support.  That probably
explains why I don't see any of these hangs.

Oh.  I can't *install* the debian liburing-dev package because it has
a versioned dependency on linux-libc-dev >= 5.1, which isn't compatible
with me having a linux-libc-dev-djwong package that contains the uapi
headers for the latest upstream kernel and Replaces: linux-libc-dev.
So either I have to create a dummy linux-libc-dev with adequate version
number that pulls in my own libc header package, or rename that package.

<sigh> It's going to take me a while to research how best to split this
stupid knot.
