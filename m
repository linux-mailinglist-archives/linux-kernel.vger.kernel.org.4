Yes, I think if the firmware upload interface could be generic, then add
it to the mtd devices, rather than creating a "virtual mtd management"
device as this patch does.

This directory block content is unrelated to the firmware image, so
could be written before firmware upload interface is created. The
firmware image uploading could be done without touching directory
blocks. That means directory blocks could be set by driver as
no-touch area for firmware uploading interface.

I don't mean to remove the support of verification from driver. I say
remove the verification from MTD firmware upload process. You can
use another interface in your driver to verify if FPGA could load the
content in user block at any time.

In my opinion, generic firmware upload interface for MTD could be used
out of FPGA cases, it just deals with writing the image file to the MTD.
Once you have nothing more to write for the image file, the job for the
interface could be successfully done.

I actually don't think this belongs to FPGA domain. My pereference is a
generic MTD firmware upload interface for MTD domain.

But this is just my opinion. You may talk to MTD or SoC maintainers for
final solution.
