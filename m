The problem I see with kernel/module parameters is that it is really 
hard to differentiate whether they should be applied across all 
instances of the device/drivers or just for one in particular.

The Raspberry Pi 4 is a single pcie-brcmstb instance, but we have other 
systems supported by that driver on Set-top-box and Cable Modem chips 
for instance where we may have different types of end-points being 
connected, some of which could be Multi-chip-module (MCM) where 
everything is known ahead of time, and sometimes cards that are plugged 
to full-sized PCIe or mini-PCIe connectors, where some amount of runtime 
discoverability is involved.

Without inventing some custom modular parameter syntax, it may not work 
that well. The Device Tree properties at least easily allow for 
per-instance configuration.
