"two params: on, off ... default param is NULL" doesn't read quite
right because "NULL" is not a valid parameter value.

I think you could just omit that last sentence completely because it's
obvious that if you don't specify the parameter, it doesn't affect
anything and the existing behavior is unchanged (it's determined by
whether VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP is specified in vmd_ids[]).

I think Lorenzo is out of the office this week, but I'm sure he'll
take care of this when he returns.

In the meantime, can you include a sample usage in the commit log so
folks don't have to dig through the patch and figure out how to use
the parameter?

It would also be nice to include a hint about why a user would choose
"on" or "off".  What is the performance effect?  What sort of I/O
scenario would lead you to choose "on" vs "off"?

ee81ee84f873 ("PCI: vmd: Disable MSI-X remapping when possible")
suggests that MSI-X remapping (I assume the "msi_remap=on" case):

  - Limits the number MSI-X vectors available to child devices to the
    number of VMD MSI-X vectors.

  - Reduces interrupt handling performance because child device
    interrupts have to go through the VMD MSI-X domain interrupt
    handler.

So I assume "msi_remap=off" would remove that MSI-X vector limit and
improve interrupt handling performance?

But obviously there's more to consider because those are both good
things and if we could do that all the time, we would.  So there must
be cases where we *have* to remap.  ee81ee84f873 suggests that not all
VMD devices support disabling remap.  There's also a hint that some
virt configs require it.

This patch doesn't enforce either of those things.  What happens if
the user gets it wrong?

ee81ee84f873 mentions MSI-X explicitly (which is different from MSI),
so maybe use "MSI-X" here and in the messages below to avoid any
confusion.

The usual strcmp() idiom is to test "!strcmp(...)" instead of
"strcmp(...) == 0)".  No need for "()" around
VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP.
