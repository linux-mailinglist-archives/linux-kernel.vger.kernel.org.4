Well, do_writepages() will not retry if wbc->sync_mode == WB_SYNC_NONE. So
the inconsistency can stay for a long time.

No, you are right, this case is safe. Still I suspect inconsistencies with
extent status tree can cause more problems and possibly stale data
exposure.

I see, thanks for explanation! Indeed it may be good to cleanup this code
so that indirect block and extent based inodes are handled in the same way.
