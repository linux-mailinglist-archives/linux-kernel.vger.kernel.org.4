I think we might have different views here. A process has a pre-V, a and
post-V state. Is allowing a process to enter V without the correct
preconditions a good idea? Allow to run with V turned on, but not able
to correctly handle a signal (the stack is too small)?

This was the same argument that the Intel folks had when enabling
AMX. Sure, AMX requires *explicit* enablement, but same rules should
apply, no?

For me it's obvious to fail (always) "if the altstack is too small to
enable V", because it allows to execute V without proper preconditions.

Personally, I prefer a stricter model. Only enter V if you can, and
after entering it disallow changing the altstack.

Then again, this is *my* opinion and concern. What do other people
think? I don't want to stall the series.

Thank you for your hard work! It would be awesome to *finally* have
vector support in the kernel!
