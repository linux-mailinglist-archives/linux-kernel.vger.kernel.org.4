At some point, yes, but my strong preference is to document the x86 side of things
and then work from there.  For KVM x86, I can mostly just say "these are the rules".
Same goes for the other KVM arch maintainers (for their areas).

Incorporating all of KVM would require a much more collaborative effort, which isn't
a bad thing, but it will take more time and effort.  And IMO, KVM x86 needs this
typ eof documentation a lot more than the other KVM architectures, i.e. pushing out
KVM x86 documentation in order to go for more comprehensive documentation is not a
good tradeoff.

Yes.

Hmm, good question.  Using kvm-86/next is likely the best answer in most cases.
kvm/master is usually a bad choice because it won't have _any_ changes for the next
release, i.e. using it as a base is more likely to yield conflicts.  Similarly,
kvm/queue and kvm/next are unlikely to have more relevant changes than kvm-x86/next.

If there are non-trivial conflicts with multiple architectures then coordination
between maintainers will be required no matter what base is used.  And I would
expect people sending those types of series to have enough experience to be able
to make a judgment call and/or engage with maintainers to figure out the best solution.

I'll rework the "Base Tree/Branch" to explicitly state that any series that primarily
targets x86 should be based on kvm-x86/next, but with a "use common sense" qualifier.

I really don't want to hold up KVM-unit-test patches waiting for KVM fixes to be
merged.  KUT is already woefully under-maintained, artificially holding up patches
will only make things worse.  And simply waiting for patches to land in KVM doesn't
necessarily solve things either, e.g. if the fixes land in kvm/master mid-cycle
then running against kvm/next will continue to fail.  Waiting also doesn't help
people running KUT against older kernels, e.g. for qualifying stable kernels.

I completely understand the pain, but unfortunately no one has come up with an
elegant, low-maintenance solution (this problem has been discussed multiple times
in the past).
