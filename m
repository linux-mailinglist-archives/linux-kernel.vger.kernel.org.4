With 255 vcpus:

Before:

vagrant@kmod ~ $ sudo systemd-analyze                                            
Startup finished in 41.653s (kernel) + 44.305s (userspace) = 1min 25.958s        
graphical.target reached after 44.178s in userspace.  

root@kmod ~ # grep "Virtual mem wasted bytes"
/sys/kernel/debug/modules/stats    
 Virtual mem wasted bytes       1949006968                                       

So ~1.8 GiB.

After:

root@kmod ~ # systemd-analyze 
Startup finished in 35.872s (kernel) + 41.715s (userspace) = 1min 17.588s 
graphical.target reached after 41.594s in userspace.

Duplicate failed modules:
              Module-name        How-many-times                    Reason
                   cryptd                     1                  Becoming

475409 /lib/modules/6.3.0-next-20230505+/kernel/crypto/cryptd.ko

So yeah definitely a pretty good improvement. Sometimes the system boots
without any duplicates at all, for some reason Vs the previous attempt.
