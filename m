One of the many missing pieces of overlay support.  There have been several
discussion of how to describe a "socket" in a device tree that a device
could be plugged into, where a single device tree subtree .dtb could be
relocated to one or more different socket locations.  Thus in this
case a single overlay could be relocated to various PCI slots.

I don't expect be getting involved in any future efforts around sockets
(see my following comment for why).

It is not potential bugs.  The current run time overlay implementation is
proof of concept quality and completeness.  It is not production ready.

I got an opportunity for early retirement a couple of weeks ago.  My first
inclination was to continue the same level of device tree maintainership,
but I am quickly realizing that there are other activities that I would
like to devote my time and energy to.  I will continue to support Rob with
minor patch reviews and testing, and potentially finishing up some
improvements to unittest.  On the other hand, bringing run time overlay
support to product quality would be a major investment of my time that I
am not willing to continue.

So I am leaving major overlay issues in the capable hands of Rob.  I may
chime in from time to time when I can do so without requiring too much of
my time.
