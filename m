How so? For a partition the cpus_allowed mask should be the parition
CPUs. The only magical bit about partitions is that any one CPU cannot
belong to two partitions and load-balancing is split.

Those CPUs can come online again -- you're *again* dismissing the true
bug :/

If you filter out the offline CPUs at sched_setaffinity() time, you
forever lose those CPUs, the task will never again move to those CPUs,
even if they do come online after.

It is really simple to reproduce this:

 - boot machine
 - offline all CPUs except one
 - taskset -p ffffffff $$
 - online all CPUs

and observe your shell (and all its decendants) being stuck to the one
CPU. Do the same thing on a CPUSET=n build and note the difference (you
retain the full mask).

Only for !root tasks. Not even v2 will re-set the affinity of root tasks
afaict.

We will need a small and simple patch for /urgent, or I will need to
revert all your patches -- your call.

I also don't tihnk you fully appreciate the ramifications of
task_cpu_possible_mask(), cpuset currently gets that quite wrong.
