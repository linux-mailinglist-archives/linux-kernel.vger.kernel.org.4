I guess this means it has _PR0 and/or _PS0?  (same for devices below)

What bus does 00:03.1 lead to?  I guess it doesn't lead to any of the
devices below?

I guess 00:08.3 is a Root Port leading to bus c4?

I'm reading the excellent Documentation/driver-api/device_link.rst and
trying to match up with this topology.  This is a case where 00:03.1
is a consumer of c4:00.5.  The driver core automatically enforces that
children are suspended before parents, but since 00:03.1 is an aunt
(not a child) of c4:00.5, the device link enforces the requirement
that 00:03.1 be suspended before c4:00.5.  Right?

Is c4:00.5 an NHI?

The PCI power states shown above are the failure case?  c4:00.5
*should* remain in D0 as long as 00:03.1 is in D0, but was instead put
in D3cold?

> Currently runtime PM is allowed for all of these devices.

This is because they all have _PR0 and/or _PS0?  (Diagram doesn't show
that for 00:08.3, but I assume it must?)

And I guess they all must have dev->is_hotplug_bridge set?

Is the requirement that the supplier can never be in a lower-power
state than the consumer?

I guess that's *not* actually a requirement even though that's the
effect of this patch in this situation.  If it *were* that simple, we
would just check the supplier and consumer power states instead of
looking at all these ACPI properties.

So I guess this changes what acpi_pci_bridge_d3() returns for 00:03.1?
Previously it returned "true" because it has _PR0/_PS0 (so
acpi_pci_power_manageable() is true), but now it will return "false"
because _S0W says it can only wake from D0?
