Yes, this is also the guideline for arm64. On top of that it's supposed
to be a sane common config to be used to reproduce bugs. A common
question from maintainers is "Does it happen with defconfig?". If not,
what does it take on top of defconfig to get there?
The idea is that people can run the same config and thus the same image
on *their* boards, regardless of the particular platform.

Originally arm64 included most drivers as [=y], but this grew too big
quickly, so it was scaled back to be able to boot from the board's mass
storage (SD card, SATA, NVMe), with non-essential drivers included as
modules. And yes, most people just build and use the Image, which keeps
the build effort reasonable.
Also required features to make systemd happy, and to enable other core
distro features, were included, so that such kernels can boot distro
userland without losing significant functionality.

No such thing on arm64 either :-(
