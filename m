There is already a SPDX-License-Identifier tag, so the corresponding
license text can be removed.

Changes in the 2 files under rdma/hfi/ is a bit more than just removing
the license text. There were some Copyright(c) for GPL and BSD licence.
I have simplified it to what look logical to me.
But in case it matters, review with care.

In include/uapi/rdma/qedr-abi.h, an extar line has been added at the top
of the file to improve style.
