I'm actually not sure if this a property of the PHY, the PCIe host, or
of the combination of the two.

We thought about adding this property to the PHY, too, but we didn't
know how to handle cases where a single PCIe host is linked with
multiple PHYs for multi-lane configurations (see TI's AM65x for
example). Which PHYs latency would you use to configure this PCIe RC?

Personally I don't have a very strong opinion either way - we just
didn't know any better than to put this into the PCIe host that needs
it. If you think this is better put into the PHY node we can of course
send a new version of this patch.

Is there any binding that specifies "generic" PCIe properties, similar
to ethernet-phy.yaml? We couldn't find any.

I guess in the AM64x case the "PHY" is serdes0_pcie_link below serdes0:

&serdes0 {
        serdes0_pcie_link: phy@0 {
	...

This seems to be described by bindings/phy/phy-cadence-torrent.yaml.

Should we add a generic (without cdns) tx/rx-phy-latency-ps property
there?

Yes, it is a standard PCIe thing, but we haven't seen that many
implementations yet, so we didn't want to pretend to know what this
looks like in the generic case. We can of course drop 'cdns'.
