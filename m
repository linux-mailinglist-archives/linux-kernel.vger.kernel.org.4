Hi Jan,

We have no plans to use the ioprio_set() system call since it only 
affects foreground I/O and not page cache writeback.

While Android supports io_uring, there are no plans to support libaio in 
the Android C library (Bionic).

Regarding __get_task_ioprio(), I haven't found any code in that function 
that derives an I/O priority from the scheduling priority. Did I perhaps 
overlook something?

Until recently "none-to-rt" meant "if no I/O priority has been assigned 
to a task, use IOPRIO_CLASS_RT". Promoting the I/O priority to 
IOPRIO_CLASS_RT works for us. I'm fine with changing the meaning of 
"none-to-rt" into promoting the I/O priority class to RT. Introducing 
"promote-to-rt" as a synonym of "none-to-rt" is also fine with me.

Thanks,

Bart.
