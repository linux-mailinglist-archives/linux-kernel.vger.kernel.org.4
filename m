I'm all for making early asm code simpler so yes, can we start removing
it?

Dunno, maybe ifdef around it with a Kconfig option which is default off
and see who complains...

Right.

Ok, thanks for explaining.

I like the simplification and obviating the need for the bootloader to
do any dancing before loading the kernel.
