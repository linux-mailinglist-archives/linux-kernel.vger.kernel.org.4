It really depends on how badly the bug affects the reporter. I'm sure
that a bug that prevents GPU or audio from working alone on a shiny
brand new laptop will see lots of pings. A side issue noticed by the
user that wouldn't really affect them is more likely to end up in a
blackhole. I recently faced issues with a display controller. I sent
patches for the problems affecting my use case, and only notified the
maintainer for the other issues. Those have been "added to their todo
list (TM)". But is that really a problem ? If I'm not affected and
neither is the maintainer, there's likely better use of their time, at
least until a user who is really affected by the problem shows up.
