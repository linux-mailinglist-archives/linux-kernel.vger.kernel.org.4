Maybe it should only copy 20 bytes, but current implementation copies
whole 4KB pages:


        if (sev->snp_certs_len)
                data_npages = sev->snp_certs_len >> PAGE_SHIFT;
        ...
        ...
        /* Copy the certificate blob in the guest memory */
        if (data_npages &&
            kvm_write_guest(kvm, data_gpa, sev->snp_certs_data, data_npages << PAGE_SHIFT))
                rc = SEV_RET_INVALID_ADDRESS;


(elsewhere we ensure that sev->snp_certs_len is page-aligned, so the assignment
to data_npages is in fact correct even though looks off-by-one; aside, maybe it's
better to use some DIV_ROUND_UP macro anywhere we calculate the number of
needed pages.)

Also -- how does the guest know they got only 20 bytes and not 4096? Do they have
to read all the 'struct cert_table' entries at the beginning of the received data?
