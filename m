Hello Tvrtko.

Interesting work.

IIUC, this periodic scanning, calculating and applying could be partly
implemented with userspace utilities. (As you write, these limits are
best effort only, so it sounds to me such a total implementation is
unnecessary.)

I think a better approach would be to avoid the async querying and
instead require implementing explicit foo_charge_time(client, dur) API
(similar to how other controllers achieve this).
Your argument is the heterogenity of devices -- does it mean there are
devices/drivers that can't implement such a synchronous charging?=20

The return value of foo_charge_time() would substitute such a
notification synchronously. (By extension all clients in an affected
cgroup could be notified to achieve some broader actions.)

Back to original concern -- must all code reside in the kernel when it's
essentially advisory resource control?

This information is eventually aggregated for each process in a cgroup.
(And the action is carried on a single client, not a process.)
The per-process tracking seems like an additional indirection.
Could be the clients associated directly with DRM cgroup? [1]


Regards,
Michal

[1] I understand the sending a fd of a client is a regular operation, so
    I'm not sure how cross-cg migrations would have to be handled in any
    case.
