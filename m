Yeah, for now I'd revert the fix. It needs more thought and it is not like
it is fixing any serious vulnerability or so.

Yes, the warning triggering is actually a good thing because it shows us we
have a race where quota can get out of sync with real space usage.

No, xattr code is just a messenger here. There is a fundamental problem
that once we clear SB_RDONLY in superblock flags, anybody can come up with
any operation modifying the filesystem but until we are finished with
dquot_resume(), this operation can escape proper quota accounting.

Well, I think we should fix this properly. The problem is that currently
changing read-only state is just flipping the flag but we need an
intermediate state like "superblock is really RW but for userspace it is
RO" so that we can prepare the filesystem for taking the writes - in fact
we've already faced very similar problem with orphan replay but there we've
worked around it by forbidding orphan replay on remount and playing a bit
hacky games on mount.

I think I can see a way to solve this problem. I'll send patches.
