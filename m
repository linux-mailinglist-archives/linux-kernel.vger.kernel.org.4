Thanks for pointing this out, will do.

Thanks a lot for this analysis. I agree that the lock can be removed
with proper READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE, but I think there is another purpose
of the lock that we are missing here.

I think one other purpose of the lock is avoiding a thundering herd
problem on cgroup_rstat_lock, particularly from reclaim context, as
mentioned by the log of  commit aa48e47e3906 ("memcg: infrastructure
to flush memcg stats").

While testing, I did notice that removing this lock indeed causes a
thundering herd problem if we have a lot of concurrent reclaimers. The
trylock makes sure we abort immediately if someone else is flushing --
which is not ideal because that flusher might have just started, and
we may end up reading stale data anyway.

This is why I suggested replacing the lock by an atomic, and do
something like this if we want to maintain the current behavior:

static void __mem_cgroup_flush_stats(void)
{
    ...
    if (atomic_xchg(&ongoing_flush, 1))
        return;
    ...
    atomic_set(&ongoing_flush, 0)
}

Alternatively, if we want to change the behavior and wait for the
concurrent flusher to finish flushing, we can maybe spin until
ongoing_flush goes back to 0 and then return:

static void __mem_cgroup_flush_stats(void)
{
    ...
    if (atomic_xchg(&ongoing_flush, 1)) {
        /* wait until the ongoing flusher finishes to get updated stats */
        while (atomic_read(&ongoing_flush) {};
        return;
    }
    /* flush the stats ourselves */
    ...
    atomic_set(&ongoing_flush, 0)
}

WDYT?
