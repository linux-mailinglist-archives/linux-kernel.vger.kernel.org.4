Ye, not disagreeing with that part.

Okay, I'll take your word for it. It just looked/looks odd to me!

Hopefully! It's the removable modules that are seemingly a no-go for
PCI.
I'll prod Daire on Monday about responding to the comments and perhaps
the start of the series could get picked up. I'm not too sure if that's
something that the PCI folk do though.

I saw Luis' name on the suggestion which is why I asked rather than
dismiss it offhand. I think that's kinda silly, but I guess license
stuff invites paranoia.
I'd been kinda keeping an eye on the series as I know I've got a
non-module clk driver that has MODULE_CRAP() in it & been debating
whether I should just go & delete it all.
Still undecided.

Supporter is a weird one I suppose, without reading the header* it's a
little confusing. There was a thread recently with an attempt to
disambiguate in the submitting patches docs, and I /think/ one of what
they wanted to do was make get_maintainer return maintainer for both
maintainer and supporter to align better with the docs.

*Because who reads the intro/header explanation of the file, right? Just
run the script and/or jump straight to the relevant section

Dw about it, sorry if I came across a little brisk.
