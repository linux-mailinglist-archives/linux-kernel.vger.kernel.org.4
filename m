Why do you say it's strange to be worried about?  The GPC and Xen code is all quite
complex and has had multiple bugs, several of which are not exactly edge cases.
I don't think it's at all strange to want to make it difficult to introduce a bug
that would in many ways be worse than panicking the kernel.

But as Paolo said, the APIs themselves are to blame[*], check() and refresh()
shouldn't be split for the common case, i.e. this particular concern should largely
be a non-issue in the long run.

I honestly don't see a meaningful difference in this case.  The only practical
difference is that shoving @len into the cache makes the check a one-time thing.
The "mandatory" check at use time still relies on a human to not make a mistake.
If the check were derived from the actual access, a la get_user(), then I would
feel differently.

Case in point, the mandatory check didn't prevent KVM from screwing up bounds
checking in kvm_xen_schedop_poll().  The PAGE_SIZE passed in for @len is in no
way tied to actual access that's being performed, the code is simply regurgitating
the size of the cache.

The WARN doesn't get false positive because "struct pvclock_vcpu_time_info" is
placed at the end of "struct vcpu_info" and "struct compat_vcpu_info".
 
I don't have a strong opinion on whether it's "!=" of "<", my goal in adding the
WARN was primarily to show that @len really is immutable in this case.  Guarding
against future overrun bugs was a bonus.
