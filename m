I don't really know what to add to my e-mail of Nov 16
(quoted here in full).

Yes, pci_channel_offline() returns true on transient and permanent
failure.  Whether that's what you want, depends on your use case.
If you want to check for a surprise-removed device, then you only
want to check for permanent failure, so pci_channel_offline() is
not correct and you should rather check for
"pdev->error_state == pci_channel_io_perm_failure" or move
pci_dev_is_disconnected() to include/linux/pci.h.  But again,
I've already explained this in my e-mail ov Nov 16, so I don't
know what's unclear.

Thanks,

Lukas
