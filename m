Indeed, I was going to mention that.  Falling back means that the
security guarantee is lost, perhaps silently and lost on the owner of
the system, if they are not paying attention to things like the boot
logs.

One of the persistent challenges with these hardware security
technologies is that they need to be ubiquitous to be useful,
something that has historically plagued all of these technologies.

It will be necessary, and important, to differentiate between
'supported' and 'available'.

Historically, security features have been SKU'ified, in other words,
made available only on specific SKU's, even when the platform writ
large has the necessary support.  These SKU's are designed to be
directed at various verticals or OEM's who are perceived to be willing
to pay more for enhanced security.

I've had conversations on whether or not hardware technologies would
be available and the conversation usually ends with the equivalent of:
"Show us the business case for supporting this."

Which translates, roughly, into how much money are we going to make if
we offer this.

Unfortunately, without being ubiquitous, as you note for a long period
of time, there is no development interest, which in turn translates
into no market 'pull'.  A rather troublesome dilemma for security
innovation.
