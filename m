It's CONFIG_OF_EARLY_FLATTREE which you would need and that's not user 
selectable. At a minimum, you need some kconfig changes. Where are 
those?

Also see my comment on v1 about running DT validation on your dtb. I'm 
sure running it would point out other issues. Such as the root level 
comaptible string(s) need to be documented. You need cpu nodes, 
interrupt controller, timers, etc. Those all have to be documented.
