True, but any persistent data based on this key would be affected.

The existing keyctl09 test is a plain text string.  Converting it to
hex-ascii (e.g. hexdump, xdd) solves the length issue.  For those
already using encrypted keys with user provided data, this might also
resolve the persistent data usage case mentioned above.

Perhaps keep the existing test.  On success issue a warning.  On
failure, retry with the converted plain text string.
