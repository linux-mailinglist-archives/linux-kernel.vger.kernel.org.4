Intel normally releases the doc much earlier than shipping the hardware
to customers.  For example, the x86 Linear Address Masking doc has been
released in 2020 (allowing Linus himself to hack the LAM code in kernel
:), but AFAIK there is no Intel CPU models released with LAM support yet
(at least my Raptor Lake does not indicate LAM in cpuid, or maybe I'm
missing the latest server models?)

For other vendors I'm not sure.

Hmm, is it an inherent limitation of Clang or it's simply not
implemented for LoongArch yet?  On x86_64 I tried ".byte 0x90" in the
inline assembly and Clang correctly emits a nop instruction.

Or it may be resolved by some fancy #ifdef directives.
