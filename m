I think this is slowly becoming less true with the "modern BPF"
described by Alexei in [0], but I agree that it's certainly the vast
majority of cases now, and I'm fine with removing this from the doc to
decouple it from the larger kfunc lifecycle discussion. Toke mentioned
something similar in [1], so I'll remove this in v3.
