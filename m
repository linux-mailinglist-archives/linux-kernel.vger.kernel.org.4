Look, this is all well and nice but you've integrated user events with
tracefs. This is currently a single-instance global filesystem. So what
you're effectively implying is that you're namespacing tracefs by
hanging it off of struct user namespace making it mountable by
unprivileged users. Or what's the plan?

That alone is massive work with _wild_ security implications. My
appetite for exposing more stuff under user namespaces is very low given
the amount of CVEs we've had over the years.

Yet you were confident enough to leave the namespacing stubs for this
functionality in the code. ;)

What is the overall goal here? Letting arbitrary unprivileged containers
define their own custom user event type by mounting tracefs inside
unprivileged containers? If so, what security story is going to
guarantee that writing arbitrary tracepoints from random unprivileged
containers is safe?

How? You currently have a single file that will have to be shared across
all unprivileged containers which ultimately can only mean that you need
to either bind-mount tracefs or bind-mount the single file into each
container. If you have 1000 containers each with isolated idmaps from
each other you're going to have a lot of fun trying to ensure that each
container has access rights to that file.

What is the "system name" and how does it protect against namespaces
messing with each other?
