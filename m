I've glanced at the driver a bit:

1. Nothing criminal I've noticed in the way the BARs are mapped. It's
done as it's normally done. pcim_iomap_regions() is supposed to map
with no additional optimization. So the caching seems irrelevant
in this case.

2. The probe() method performs some device iATU config:
akida_1500_setup_iatu() and akida_1000_setup_iatu(). I would have a
closer look at the way the inbound MWs setup is done.

3. akida_1000_iatu_conf_table contains comments about the APB bus. If
it's an internal device bus and both LPDDR and eDMA are accessible
over the same bus, then the re-ordering may happen there. If APB means
the well known Advanced Peripheral Bus, then it's a quite slow bus
with respect to the system interconnect and PCIe buses. If eDMA regs
and LL-memory buses are different then the last write to the LL-memory
might be indeed still pending while the doorbells update arrives.
Sending a dummy read to the LL-memory stalls the program execution
until a response arrive (PCIe MRd TLPs are non-posted - "send and wait
for response") which happens only after the last write to the
LL-memory finishes. That's probably why your fix with the dummy-read
works and why the delay you noticed is quite significant (4us).
Though it looks quite strange to put LPDDR on such slow bus.

4. I would have also had a closer look at the way the outbound MW is
configured in your PCIe host controller (whether it enables some
optimizations like Relaxed ordering and ID-based ordering).

In anyway I would have got in touch with the FPGA designers whether
any of my suppositions correct (especially regarding 3.).
