I am not sure I understand the part about 'includes skbuff.h' yet, it seems
'skbuff.h' does not have anything related to this patch?

Do you mean by removing "#include <linux/dma-direction.h>" as dma-mapping.h
has included dma-direction.h?
But I am not sure if there is any hard rule about not explicitly including
a .h which is implicitly included. What if the dma-mapping.h is changed to not
include dma-direction.h anymore?

Anyway, it seems it is unlikely to not include dma-direction.h in dma-mapping.h,
Will remove the "#include <linux/dma-direction.h>" if there is another version
needed for this patchset:)
