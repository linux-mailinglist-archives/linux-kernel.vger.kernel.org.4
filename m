It is especially inadvisable to stress it during OOM events, when the
workqueue system might well get an allocation failure when it tries
creating another kworker kthread.  And we do want this to work well when
at/near OOM, because this is one of the things that can free memory.  ;-)

Let's get organized first, but that would be a good thing.  Or I could
reach out to Tejun internally.

For but one thing to get organized about, maybe kfree_rcu() should be
using a workqueue with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set.
