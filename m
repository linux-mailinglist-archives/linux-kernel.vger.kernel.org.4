The process of the hardware going into s2idle has a certain
sequence of events by the platform.

This sequence is what causes the PME to not be able to work
during resume.  This issue has been root caused and is
understood by AMD platform designers.

It's why the AML doesn't provide any of those ACPI power
management routines outlined in the ACPI spec.

If the AML is patched to advertise these routines the exact
same issue is reproduced under Windows 11.

OK thanks!
