Having spent longer than I maybe should've looking at your patches
Heiko, given it's a Saturday evening, the precedence stuff is still
sticking out to me..

For Zbb & fast unaligned, the order may be non-controversial, but in
the general case I don't see how it can be true that the order of
precedence for variants is a constant.

Creating pseudo cpufeatures as Drew suggested does seem like a way to
extract complexity from the alternatives themselves (which I think is a
good thing) but at the expense of eating up cpu_req_feature bits...
By itself, it doesn't help with precedence, but it may better allow us
to deal with some of the precedence in cpufeature.c, since the
alternative would operate based on the pseudo cpufeature rather than on
the individual capabilities that the pseudo cpufeature depends on.

I tried to come up with a suggestion for what to do about precedence,
but everything I thought up felt a bit horrific tbh.
The thing that fits the current model best is just allowing cpu vendors
to add, yet more, "errata" that pick the variant that works best for
their implementation... Although I'd be worried about ballooning some of
these ALT_FOO macros out to a massive degree with that sort of approach.

The order in which an alternative is added to the macro does matter,
right? At least, that's how I thought it worked and hope I've not had
an incorrect interpretation there all along... I wasn't until I started
reading your patch and couldn't understand why you had a construct that
looked like

if (zbb && !fast_unaligned)
=2E..
else if (zbb && fast_unaligned)
=2E..

rather than just inverting the order and dropping the !fast_unaligned
that I realised I might have a gap in my understanding after all..
