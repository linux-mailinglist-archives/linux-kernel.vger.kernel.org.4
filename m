Yes, I'm keeping up with this review and staying informed. It's worth
noting that the peripheral clock driver already includes PWM clocks,
with an important remark about reparenting being switched off. It's
described below.

Allow me to share my thoughts on this matter. From my understanding,
Amlogic provides an RTC clock that is both accurate and power-effective
in achieving a 32KHz signal from an internal xtal of 24MHz. However,
this requires a complex RTC divider with four parameters (m1, m2, n1,
n2), as it cannot be accomplished with a single divider. Our team has
measured the RTC clock using an oscilloscope on the GEN CLK pin and
found that it provides a stable 32KHz signal with acceptable jitter. On
the other hand, other approaches, such as the PWM way, yield less stable
and less accurate 32KHz signals with greater jitter.

Additionally, the CCF determines the best ancestor based on how close
its rate is to the given one, based on arithmetic calculations. However,
we have independent knowledge that a certain clock would be better, with
less jitter and fewer intermediaries, which will likely improve energy
efficiency. Sadly, the CCF cannot take this into account.

Given the advantages of the RTC clock, we wish to be able to control the
RTC as a parent for specific leaf clocks. This is achievable with the
'assigned-clocks' feature of CCF OF, but it poses a significant
architectural problem. The 'assigned-clocks' node does not lock/pin the
parent, and a simple clk_set_rate() call can change the parent during
rate propagation. In my opinion, an ideal solution to this problem would
be an additional patch to the CCF core that provides this locking
capability. As a board DTS developer, I know which clock I want to use
as the parent and have a strong reason for doing so, and I do not wish
to open up my parent muxing to other drivers. But until the behavior of
'assigned-clocks' is not available, we will simply label all RTC
children with the CLK_SET_RATE_NO_REPARENT flag.
