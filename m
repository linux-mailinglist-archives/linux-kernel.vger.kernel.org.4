Trying to remember ... :-)

So this is what I recall at this point:

 - Ancient X11 didn't understand domains in /proc and thus would barf,
which was the primary reason for not enabling them always iirc...

 - There might be something else with early PowerMacs (Grand Central
chipset) where we have effectively two domains (gc and chaos) but
overlapping bus numbers. There might still be pre-historical code in
there that assumes it's that way though I can't see anything obvious.
Paul might still have one of these :-) (PowerMac 7200/7500/8500/9500
afaik).

 - pci-OF-bus-map predates the PCI layer keeping track of the PCI/OF
relationship. I don't believe it's still used anywhere in the kernel,
though it's possible (unlikely ?) that some garbage remains in
userspace that does.

At this point, I wouldn't object to tearing this all out and just
having domains always (and see what the fallout is).

Cheers,
Ben.
