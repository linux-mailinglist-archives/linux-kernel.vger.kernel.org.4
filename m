:-) Thank you very much for the input. Will keep that in mind for next.


Some info...

rx is actually broken for spi gsi. A plain rx operation would crash 
right now and patch for same would come next; There are 3 further 
patches as well for gsi.

I started with simplest patch hoping it would get in quick.

While trying to bring up EC use case with spi gsi, we made some changes 
to conform to GSI spec, made some progress but still couldn't get it to 
work.

In the meantime we switched to SE DMA as interim.
