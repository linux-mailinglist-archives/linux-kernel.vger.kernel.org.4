Sorry, I didn't find time to look into this earlier. I've just had a
high-level look into the patches and I have one question: Did you consider
a solution where you'd basically duplicate all of the scheduling for each
actuator (thus making them effectively independent devices from the point
of view of BFQ)? From the first look it would look like somewhat simpler
solution than splitting all the BFQ queues and implementing special
injection mechanism for other actuators and perhaps lead to better
utilization of the actuators. OTOH the latecy and QoS for tasks using
multiple actuators would be probably worse because it would be basically
determined by the busiest of the actuators. So I'm asking mostly out of
curiosity :)
