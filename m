Looking at the actual code, here's what I'd do:

I think that means that your specific test is generally going to
exercise the case where the lock is held because we're waiting for I/O.
That's exactly what you set it up to produce, after all!  But it won't
affect the cases where the folio lock is being held for other reasons,
which your testcase is incredibly unlikely to produce.
