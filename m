Your allocator implicitly relies on vmalloc because of module_alloc ;-)

What I was thinking is that we can replace module_alloc() calls in your
allocator with something based on my unmapped_alloc(). If we make the part
that refills the cache also take care of creating the mapping in the
module address space, that should cover everything.
