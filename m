If there was a regression due to this, we'd be very interested in
hearing about it. Aaron he did the work to move the code to its own directory.

In general we could all benefit from an enhancement for a shortname for
things which could be modules being built-in. We're now seeing requests
for dynamic debug, but it could also be usefulf for Nick's future work
to help userspace tools / tracing map kallsysms to specific modules when
built-in.

To that end I had suggested the current state of affairs & current difficulty
in trying to get us a name for this here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y/kXDqW+7d71C4wz@bombadil.infradead.org/

I ended up suggesting perhaps we need a -DPOSSIBLE_MODULE then if we
could *somehow* pull that off perhaps then we could instead use
-DPOSSIBLE_KBUILD_MODNAME which would ensure a consistent symbol when
a module is built-in as well.

That still leaves the difficulty in trying to gather possible-obj-m as
a future challenge.
