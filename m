Yes, "identify the PCI device (vendor/product) and some memory areas".
The driver for the (vendor/product) 'knows' what peripherals are exposed
by the device and where within the BAR to find the registers for each
of the devices.

A normal PCI driver would contain this information.  If I understand the
proposal of this patch series, of_pci_make_dev_node() adds a node to
the devicetree, when invoked via a PCI quirk for certain specific
vendor/product cards.  This node must exist for the flattened device
tree (FDT) overlay for the card to be loaded.  The driver for the card
will get the overlay FDT from the card and load it into the kernel.
The driver will use the information that then exists in the devicetree
describing the card, instead of using information from the PCI configuration
headers from the card.

The intent is to be able to re-use devicetree based drivers instead of
having the driver be a native PCI driver.

This goes against historical Linux practice.  The idea of taking a driver
from another environment (eg Windows, HP Unix, Sun Unix, IBM Unix, etc)
and adding a shim layer to translate between Linux and the other
environment has been rejected.  Ironically, in this case, the other
environment is Linux (more specifically the Linux OF implementation).
Even thought the other environment is Linux, this is still adding a
shim layer to translate between that other environment and the native
Linux PCI environment for which the driver would normally be written.

In other words, this is not acceptable.  Normal alternatives would be
something like (1) add the PCI awareness to the existing drivers,
(2) split the devicetree aware and PCI aware portions of the driver
to common code that would be invoked from separate devicetree and PCI
drivers, (3) write entirely separate devicetree and PCI drivers, or
(4) some other creative solution.

Am I mis-interpretting or misunderstanding anything crucial here?
