According to the same ACPI 6.5 s8.4.6.1.2.5 "Time Window Register" paragraph,
and assuming we are in the 'Autonomous Selection is not enabled' case,
the OS is supposed to write (not read) the delta between successive reads of the
counter, so using this field as is would be bending the definition I think.

-
It is correct that the "Time Window Register" field specifies a value in ms,
but it seems a long time to wait for with irqs off.

-
Theoretically, the perf/ref counters should accumulate to allow computing
a correct frequency. Is it possible to know how these counters are accessed ?
Is it through PCC channels and there is some undesired delay between the
reads of the perf/ref counters ?

-
About making the delay:
     max(cppc_cpufreq_get_transition_delay_us(), Time Winder Register)
I think it would be good to know why the values of the counters
don't accumulate correctly, ideally by getting a trace where a frequency
above the maximum frequency is computed, and with the timestamps at which
the counters are read.
If the values are coming from PCC channels / the firmware, it might be difficult
to get.

Just for reference, the value of 2us was picked in this thread:
