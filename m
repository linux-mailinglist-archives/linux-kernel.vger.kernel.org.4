Thanks, this is definitely of interest to linux-pci.

I agree, I don't like to see more uses of pci_get_device() because it
doesn't fit the driver model at all.  For one thing, it really screws
up the hotplug model because this doesn't account for hot-added
devices and there's no clear cleanup path for removal.

Hotplug is likely not an issue in this particular case, but it gets
copied to places where it is an issue.

Maybe we need some kind of PCI core interface whereby drivers can
register their interest in VSEC and/or DVSEC capabilities.
