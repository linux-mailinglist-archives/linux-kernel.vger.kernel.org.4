...submit that quirk, as Bjorn and Alex apparently didn't pick this up?
I could do so myself, but prefer to leave that to people that actually
known what they are doing -- and thus can also handle problems later, in
case any show up. And strictly speaking it apparently was you who caused
this regression with 78013eaadf6 ("x86: remove the IOMMU table
infrastructure").
