Ah, you're right, sorry I missed that.  Dispensing with the SERDES
details would make this more obvious.

Not sure why this needs to change the pci_scan_slot() path, since
Function 0 is present and enumerable even though it's not useful in
some cases.  Seems like something in pci_set_of_node() or a quirk
could do whatever you need to do.
