If the page is demoted by following thread B's mempolicy, didn't it
already break thread A's mempolicy in the first place if you care
about it? If thread A and thread B have the same mempolicy, then it is
not a problem.

Actually there is another problem for shared page. If a page is shared
by two processes, P1 and P2, when you do rmap walk to find the task,
you may find two contradict mempolicy, what mempolicy would you like
to obey? Do you have to save all the intermediate mempolicy results
somewhere or you just bail out once the first mempolicy is found?
