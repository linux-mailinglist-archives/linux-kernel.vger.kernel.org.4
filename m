But why should this thing have priority over other potential features?
As I said above, there are two requirements:

- being able to share a single NMI SGI amongst multiple users

- being able to free existing SGIs in case we absolutely need an SGI
  for some other purposes

In both cases, this is about making the SGI space scale *beyond* the 8
possible interrupts that we have. This needs to be solved to get
something like this in.

And I don't think hiding this behind an obscure "debug" configuration
option that will get abused with out of tree stuff is a good move.
Quite the opposite.

Thanks,

	M.
