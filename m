Hi Rafael,

Sorry, I'm still confused (my perpetual state :)).

But the current upstream code checks acpi_pci_power_manageable(dev)
first, so if "dev" has _PR0 or _PS0, we'll use D3 even if _S0W says it
can wake from D3 and wakeup.flags is not valid.

With the patch below, the RP _S0W must either fail or return D3hot or
D3cold (this is what I meant by "RP can wake from D3hot or D3cold")
before we even look for _PR0/_PS0.

Maybe we're talking about two different things -- you suggest we
should check whether the *Root Port* has _PR0 or _PS0, but the current
code checks the bridge "dev", which might be *below* the Root Port
IIUC.

Hmm.  In the case where _S0W is present and says at least D3hot but
wakeup.flags is not valid, the patch below returns 'true' if "dev"
has _PR0 or _PS0.

In the current patch, wakeup.flags is only relevant if the RP has
"HotPlugSupportInD3".  If "dev" has _PR0 or _PS0, we'll return 'true'
even if wakeup.flags is not valid.  Maybe that's wrong?
