Yes it is problematic.  AFAICT there are no notifier chain for
changing modes; you probably don't want me to add one and neither do I
:-).
Our HW should shift gears when there is a change the standard L1SS
control field, but it does not -- more on this below.

We can only safely support it if we know a priori that (a) the
downstream device is ASPM capable and (b) the policy is set to
"power_supersave" and will not be changed.

For (a), I thought about having the RC probe "peek" at the downstream
devices capabilities, but that would require it to go through the
capability linked-list.  I have a feeling that would not be approved
by you folks.

For (b), there is no way to know at RC probe-time that the policy is
going to be "power_supersave".  This calculation happens after the RC
probe exits, and besides, pcie_aspm_get_policy() is a static function.
And as you mentioned, the ASPM policy may be changed at runtime.
That is the reason for the "brcm,enable-l1ss" property.

FWIW,  it's  not clear that all of the devices for drivers in
drivers/pci/controller/  support L1SS -- our driver had no mention of
ti until now.

However, I asked the PCIe HW design engineer a question similar to
yours; i.e. from looking at all of the drivers' code  as well as
pcie/asmp.c,  there doesn't seem to be any issue wrt  seamlessly
switching between uni-dir and bi-dir CLKREQ# in response to ASPM
control settings.  He just answered something on the lines that for
this design, one has to make a deliberate choice of L1SS or !L1SS and
stick with it.
