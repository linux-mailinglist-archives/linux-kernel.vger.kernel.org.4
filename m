This patchset is a third one in the series created in the framework of my
Baikal-T1 DDRC-related work:

[1: In-progress] EDAC/mc/synopsys: Various fixes and cleanups
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-edac/20220910194237.10142-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru
[2: In-progress] EDAC/synopsys: Add generic DDRC info and address mapping
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-edac/20220910195007.11027-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru
[3: In-progress] EDAC/synopsys: Add generic resources and Baikal-T1 support
Link: ---you are looking at it---

Note the patchsets above must be merged in the same order as they are
placed in the list in order to prevent conflicts. Nothing prevents them
from being reviewed synchronously though. Any tests are very welcome.
Thanks in advance.

This is a final patchset in the framework of my Synopsys DW uMCTL2 DDRC
work, which completes the driver updates with the new functionality and
at the closure introduces the Baikal-T1 DDRC support.

The series starts from extending the Synopsys DW uMCTL2 DDRC DT-schema
with the controller specific IRQs, clocks and resets properties. In
addition to the Baikal-T1 DDRC is added to the DT-bindings since it's
based on the DW uMCTL2 DDRC v2.61a.

After that we suggest to finally inform the MCI core with the detected
SDRAM ranks and make sure the detected errors are reported to the
corresponding rank. Then we extend the DDRC capabilities with optional
Scrub functionality. It's indeed possible to have the DW uMCTL2 controller
with no HW-accelerated Scrub support (no RMW engine). In that case the MCI
core is supposed to perform the erroneous location ECC update by means of
the platform-specific scrub method.

Then we get to fix the error-injection functionality a bit. First since
the driver now has the Sys<->SDRAM address translation infrastructure we
can use it to convert the supplied poisonous system address to the SDRAM
one. Thus there is no longer need in preserving the address in the device
private data. Second we suggest to add a DebuFS node-based command to
disable the error-injection feature (no idea why it hasn't been done in
the first place).

Afterwards a series of the IRQ-related patches goes. First we introduce the
individual DDRC event IRQs support in accordance with what has been added
to the DT-bindings and what the native DW uMCTL2 DDR controller actually
provides. Then aside to the ECC CE/UE errors detection we suggest to the
DFI/SDRAM CRC/Parity errors report. It specifically useful for the DDR4
memory which has dedicated ALARM_n signal, but can be still utilized in
the framework of the older protocols if the device DFI-PHY calculates
the HIF-interface signals parity. Third after adding the platform
clock/resets request procedure we introduce the HW-accelerated Scrubber
support. Its performance can be tuned by means of the sdram_scrub_rate
SysFS node and the Core clock rate. Note it is possible to one-time-run
the Scrubber in the back-to-back mode so to perform a burst-like scan of
the whole SDRAM memory.

At the patchset closure we finally fix the DW uMCTL2 DDRC kernel config to
be available not only on the Xilinx, Intel and MXC platforms and add the
Baikal-T1 DDRC support which the whole work has been dedicated for in the
first place.
