Fair enough, and the situation that this patchset is addressing is also a
bit unusual.  This change was requested by Eric Dumazet due to a situation
where someone forgot the optional second argument to kfree_rcu().  Now,
you are right that this would be caught if invoked from a non-sleepable
context, but there are also cases where sleeping is legal, but where the
occasional wait for an RCU grace period would be a problem.  The checkers
cannot easily catch this sort of thing, and hence the change in name.

Hey, the combined one/two-argument form seemed like a good idea at
the time!  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
