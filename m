Much better, thank you!

Unfortunately, given that a's average is within one standard deviation
of b's average, this is most definitely not statistically significant.
Especially given only ten measurements for each case -- you need *at*
*least* 24, preferably more.  Especially in this case, where you don't
really know what the underlying distribution is.

But we can apply the binomial distribution instead of the usual
normal distribution.  First, let's sort and take the medians:

a: 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.6 8.7 8.7 8.8 8.8 9.0 9.3  Median: 8.7
b: 7.6 7.8 8.2 8.2 8.2 8.2 8.4 8.5 8.7 9.3  Median: 8.2

8/10 of a's data points are greater than 0.1 more than b's median
and 8/10 of b's data points are less than 0.1 less than a's median.
What are the odds that this happens by random chance?

This is given by sum_0^2 (0.5^10 * binomial(10,i)), which is about 0.055.
This is not quite 95% confidence, so not hugely convincing, but it is at
least close.  Not that this is the confidence that (b) is 100ms faster
than (a), not just that (b) is faster than (a).

Not sure that this really carries its weight, but in contrast to the
usual statistics based on the normal distribution, it does suggest at
least a little improvement.  On the other hand, anyone who has carefully
studied nonparametric statistics probably jumped out of the boat several
paragraphs ago.  ;-)

A few more questions interspersed below.

Can userspace also extend the time in this manner?  I am not too worried
either way, but it would be good to make this clear.

If userspace writes a non-zero value, is that from the current time or
from boot?

Doesn't this write to rcu_boot_end_delay outside of the lock?

Temporarily dropping rcu_boot_end_lock looks like an accident waiting
to happen.

And dropping it twice does not seem good, either.  Or am I missing some
subtle control-flow trick?

Isn't it necessary to cancel a previously scheduled work to make sure
that the new value overrides the old one?

Mightn't this be simpler if the user was only permitted to write zero,
thus just saying "stop immediately"?  If people really need the ability
to extend or shorten the time, a patch can be produced at that point.
And then a non-zero write to the file would become legal.
