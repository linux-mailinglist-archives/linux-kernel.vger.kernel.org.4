Cover letter would be best.  But, a note in the changelog that it is
imperfect and will be improved on later would also be nice.

I actually try to make these somewhat mirror the code.  For instance, if
you are searching using *just* the start TDMR address, then the message
should only talk about the start address.  Also, it's not trying to find
a *node* per se.  It's trying to find a 'tmb'.  So, if someone wanted to
debug this problem, they would actually want to dump out the tmbs.

But, back to the loop that this message describes:

> +	/* Find the first memory region covered by the TDMR */
> +	list_for_each_entry(tmb, &tdx_memlist, list) {

> +	}

That loop is funky.  It's not obvious at *all* why it even works.

1. A 'tmb' describes "real" memory.  It never covers holes.
2. This code is trying to find *a* 'tmb' to place a structure in.  It
   needs real memory to place this, of course.
3. A 'tdmr' may include holes and may not have a 'tmb' at either its
   start or end address
4. A 'tdmr' is expected to cover one or more 'tmb's.  If there were no
   'tmb's, then the TDMR is going to be marked as all reserved and is
   effectively being wasted.
5. A 'tdmr' may cover more than one NUMA node.  If this happens, it is
   ok to get memory from any of those nodes for that tdmr's PAMT.

I'd include this comment on the loop:

	A TDMR must cover at least part of one TMB.  That TMB will end
	after the TDMR begins.  But, that TMB may have started before
	the TDMR.  Find the next 'tmb' that _ends_ after this TDMR
	begins.  Ignore 'tmb' start addresses.  They are irrelevant.

Maybe even a little ASCII diagram about the different tmb configurations
that this can find:

| TDMR1 | TDMR2 |
   |---tmb---|
          |tmb|
          |------tmb-------|
   |------tmb-------|

I'd also include this on the function:

/*
 * Locate a NUMA node which should hold the allocation of the @tdmr
 * PAMT.  This node will have some memory covered by the TDMR.  The
 * relative amount of memory covered is not considered.
 */
