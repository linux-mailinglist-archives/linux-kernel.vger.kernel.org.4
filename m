No, it's just another indication that the offending commit was confused.

All mainline drivers already start the link before that
wait-for-link-up, so the commit in question makes very little sense.
That's why I prefer reverting it, so as to not pollute the git logs
(e.g. for git blame) with misleading justifications.

As I mentioned in the commit message, I think the commit should just be
reverted and if there's a valid argument to be made for a similar type
of change (without the breakage), that can be done as a follow-up with a
proper motivation.
