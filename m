For my part, I was using the gstreamer v4l2 decoder which for some reason tries
to verify it can support whatever format it gets with G_FMT *before*
trying a S_FMT. I can't confirm or deny if S_FMT currently works or not.

That said, I entirely agree with Javier. While it might be more
bandwidth efficient, QC08C is a obscure format. It is far more likely that the
average open source user would rather use a well known output format and, as
has been mentioned, once S_FMT is fixed those in the know can use the other
formats if they are working with other Qualcomm hardware blocks.
