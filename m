Many thanks for your reply. :)

I think it should be Fixes: 6e6f0a1f0fa6 ("panic: don't print redundant backtraces on oops")
as there's missing stack-dumping in mce_panic() since then. Should I resend the patch with
above Fixes tag attached?

Yes, it should be a really old problem. And it seems it's unnoticed yet because mce should be a
really rare event and corresponding dump-stacking might not be that attractive at that time.

Thanks!
