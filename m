I assume this refers to a Completion with Request Retry Status (RRS)?

Do you have a pointer to that discussion?  The URL might save
repeating the whole exercise and could be useful for the commit log
when we try to resolve this.

Is there some way for users to figure out that they would need this
property?  Or is it just "if your kernel panics on boot, try
adding or increasing "bus-scan-delay-ms" in your DT?
