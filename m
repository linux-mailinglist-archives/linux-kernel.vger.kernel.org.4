So if _S0W says it can wake from D3, but wakeup.flags is not valid,
it's still OK to use D3?  I guess in this case we assume wakeup would
be via native PME/hotplug signaling?

I think you're suggesting the patch below, which will make
acpi_pci_bridge_d3(dev) return "true" if:

  - Root Port can wake from D3hot or D3cold, has "HotPlugSupportInD3",
    and has wakeup.flags.valid, OR

  - Root Port can wake from D3hot or D3cold, and "dev" has _PR0 or
    _PS0

Previously, all bridges with _PR0 or _PS0 could use D3; now we also
require that the Root Port's _S0W says it can wake from at least
D3hot.
