Side note: I would advise developers to reply to review comments
before nagging us to merge patches, it is not fine to leave
comments unanswered.

Yes, it is weird, the first call is for the platform driver specific
link HW setup and the second for the host *generic* link set-up and I
agree that's confusing, it is not related to this patch - that I am
merging - but should be addressed nonetheless.
