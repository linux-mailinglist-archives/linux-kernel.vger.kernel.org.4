Presumably the low-level glue drivers could pass a bus size or mask 
value in struct dw_pcie_rp/dw_pcie, so the actual dma_set_mask() call 
itself could be centralised? I guess there's also an argument that only 
glue drivers which care about eDMA need to care about setting a mask at 
all, so I don't have a string preference either way. If you'd rather 
stick with that approach then it might be worth a brief comment at each 
site to clarify why the other mask is being set from an entirely 
different place, just in case anyone comes along and tries to "fix" it.

Cheers,
Robin.
