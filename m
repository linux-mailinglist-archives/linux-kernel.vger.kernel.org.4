But unless I am missing something, even if there is single synchronize_rcu(),
you have a flurry of potential wakeups right now, instead of the bare minimum
I think. I have not measured how many wake ups, but I'd love to when I get
time. Maybe Vlad has some numbers.

Thanks for the background.

Yes that's what I was getting at. I thought Vlad was going for doing direct
wake ups from the main RCU GP thread that orchestates RCU grace period
cycles.

Ok. At the moment I am preparing 2 talks I am giving at OSPM for real-time and
timers. Plus preparing the PR, so I'm fully booked. :(  [and the LWN article..].

Hm, I was just going for the fact that it is a behavioral change. Not
illuding that it would certainly cause an issue. As we know, Linux kernel
developers have interesting ways of using RCU APIs. :-)

But yes, it may not be an issue considering expedited synchronize_rcu() also
has such behavior anyway, if I'm not mistaken.

Maybe the kind of workloads that don't need GP completion very quickly, but
just want to reduce wakeups. The wakeups do have a cost, the scheduler can
wake up several idle CPUs to "spread the awakened load" and cause wastage
power. And also contend on locks during the wake up.
