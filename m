In TI's J721E SoC, the PCIe controller doesn't report the Data Link
State. The bit is hardwired to zero. However, the status of the Data
Link is reported via a set of user specific registers, which aren't a
part of the standard PCIe registers. With this, I was able to observe
that despite the PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_LT bit being cleared, the Data Link
initialization was still ongoing. This leads to a race condition if it
isn't ensured that the Data Link initialization is complete before the
PCI core attempts to obtain the configuration space addresses via the
map_bus call. Based on the scheduling, it is possible for the kernel to
crash, and I was able to observe this in my setup.

With this patch applied, the issue is fixed.
