I'm wondering if that VMA shouldn't be some kind of special mapping 
(VM_PFNMAP), such that the struct page is entirely ignored?

I'm quite confused and concerned when I read that code (what the hell is 
it doing with shmem/hugetlb pages? why does the mapcount even get adjusted?)

This all has a bad smell to it, I hope I'm missing something important ...
