This patch series intends to improve kvm selftests with better code
consolidation using the helper functions to perform vcpu and thread
related operations.

In general, several aspects are improved:
1) The current users allocate an array of vcpu pointers to the vcpus that
   are added to a vm, and an array of vcpu threads. This isn't necessary
   as kvm_vm already maintains a list of added vcpus. This series changes
   the list of vcpus in the kvm_vm struct to a vcpu array for users to
   work with and removes each user's own allocation of such vcpu arrays.
   Aslo add the vcpu thread to the kvm_vcpu struct, so that users don't
   need to explicitly allocate a thread array to manage vcpu threads on
   their own.
2) Change the users to use the helper functions provided by this series
   with the following enhancements:
   - Many users working with pthread_create/join forgot to check if
     error on returning. The helper functions have handled thoses inside,
     so users don't need to handle them by themselves;
   - The vcpu threads created via the helper functions are named in
     "vcpu-##id" format. Naming the threads facilitates debugging,
     performance tuning, runtime pining etc;
   - helper functions named with "vm_vcpu_threads_" iterates over all the
     vcpus that have been added to the vm. Users don't need a explicit
     loop to go through the added cpus by themselves.
3) kvm_vcpu is used as the interface parameter to the vcpu thread's
   start routine, and the user specific data is made to be the private
   data in kvm_vcpu. This can simplify the user specific data structures,
   as kvm_vcpu has already included the required info for the thread, for
   example, in patch 13, the cpu_idx field from "struct vcpu_thread"
   is a duplicate of vcpu->id.

The changes have been tested on an SPR server. Patch 15 and 16 haven't
been tested due to the lack of an ARM environment currently.
