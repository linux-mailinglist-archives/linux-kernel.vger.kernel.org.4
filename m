You're welcome.

I am slowly working towards getting everything back into shape. In particular,
there is a patch set by Yoshinori Sato to convert arch/sh to device tree which
I would like to eventually get upstreamed.

However, since I am still new to kernel development, it will certainly take
me a little more time until we're there. However, there is some interest
in the community such as the J-Core people and Artur Rojek, so there are people
who are willing to help me.

OK, thanks for the heads-up. I cannot comment on this yet, but I have a Dreamcast
myself which I can use for testing in this case.
