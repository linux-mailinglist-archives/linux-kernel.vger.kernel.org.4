That was the goal of my talk at LPC last year:

  https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1392/

We discussed having the compiler annotate the tricky bits of control
flow, mainly jump tables and noreturns.  It's still on my TODO list to
prototype that.

Another alternative which has been suggested in the past by Indu and
others is for objtool to use DWARF/sframe as an input to help guide it
through the tricky bits.

That seems more fragile -- as Madhavan mentioned, GCC-generated DWARF
has some reliability issues -- and also defeats some of the benefits of
reverse-engineering in the first place (we've found many compiler bugs
and other surprising kernel-compiler interactions over the years).

Objtool's understanding of the control flow graph has been really
valuable for reasons beyond live patching (e.g., noinstr and uaccess
validation), it's definitely worth finding a way to make that more
sustainable.
