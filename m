Hi David,

I'm a bit surprised that this patch was ignored. I had sort of assumed
the response would be, "good god, I can't believe we're doing this.
Applied to drm-next!" rather than crickets, but maybe it just got buried
under a lot of other patches. So I thought I'd poke about this again.
The original message is reproduced in full below.

Regards,
Jason
