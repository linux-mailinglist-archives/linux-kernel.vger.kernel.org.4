I took a look on AMD SNP kernel[1], it supports host managing the CPUID
and firmware managing the CPUID. The host-managed CPUID is done via a GHCB
message call and it is going to be removed according to the SNP firmware ABI
spec:

7.1 CPUID Reporting
Note: This guest message may be removed in future versions as it is redundant with the CPUID page in SNP_LAUNCH_UPDATE. (See Section 8.17.)

So the style of CPUID virtualization of TDX and SNP will be aligned eventually.
Both will configure the supported CPUID for the firmware/TDX module before
creating a vCPU.
