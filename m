The problem I can see is that the root's peak value doesn't really
represent the system peak memory usage because it only reflects memcg
accounted memory. So there is plenty of memory consumption which is not
covered. On top of that a lot of memory contributed to the root memcg is
not accounted at all (see try_charge and its callers) so the cumulative
hierarchical value is incomplete and I believe misleading as well.
