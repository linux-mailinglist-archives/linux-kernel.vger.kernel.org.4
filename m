We do sometimes use "VMX" and "SVM" to refer to KVM, but usually only when
differentiating betwen "KVM x86" and "KVM <vendor>".  In most cases I don't think
it would matter, but in this particular case, since the GATag is kinda sorta
consumed by hardware, but IIUC is purely software-defined, knowing whether "SVM"
means "KVM" or "SVM the architecture" is an important distinction.

Definitely a nit, but I would probably omit the info about the IOMMU driver.  That
information matters if someone is trying to understand _all_ of the pieces, but
for this specific bug I think it just ends up introducing noise.

"up to"

Nit, x2AVIC doesn't "require" anything.  What matters is what KVM allows.  I get
what you're saying, but I want to cleanly separate "what's allowed by the spec"
and "what does KVM actually do".

Thank you for the explanation of how this all works!  IIUC, this is missing one
key point though: the GATag is 100% software-defined and never interpreted by
hardware.  I.e. KVM can shove whatever it wants into the tag.

And while I'm nitpicking, please lead with the "what".  For the changelog as a whole,
some maintainers/subsystems prefer leading with the "why", but I strongly prefer that
changelogs state what the patch actually does and then provide the background/justification.

Isn't the existing mask wrong?  The high bit is inclusive, i.e. this is defining
a mask of 10 bits, not 9.

Actually, neither 10 nor 9 bits is correct if we are going by the most recent APM,
i.e. the mask should be 8:0 if we want to tie this to what is actually defined in
the architecture.

  All the addresses point to 4-Kbyte aligned data structures. Bits 11:0 are reserved
  (except for offset 0F8h) and should be set to zero. The lower 8 bits of offset 0F8h
  are used for the field AVIC_PHYSICAL_MAX_INDEX. VMRUN fails with #VMEXIT(VMEXIT_INVALID)
  if AVIC_PHYSICAL_MAX_INDEX is greater than 255 in xAVIC mode or greater than 511 in
  x2AVIC mode.

Looking through the discussion history of the x2AVIC enabling, this appears to be
an off-by-one goof, i.e. not a deliberate speculation on how bits 11:9 will be
used.

> +#define AVIC_PHYSICAL_MAX_INDEX_BITS	9

This name is misleading/wrong.  As above, the high bit is inclusive.  If we wanted
to specify the high bit, it would be something like MAX_INDEX_MAX_BIT, which is pretty
awful.

Ha!  We don't need a separate define.  const_hweight.h provides compile-time
hweight, a.k.a. popcount, macros.  We can use that to compute the shift of the
VM ID portion of the GATag, then we don't need to come up with a name.

I'll post the below as v2 on top of the AVIC_PHYSICAL_MAX_INDEX_MASK fix.
