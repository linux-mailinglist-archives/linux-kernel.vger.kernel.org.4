Yes, please add this patch.

Otherwise, other people may suffer from the same issue someday.

After  this patch added,  I will try respin my etnaviv patch set.

If the PCI core could shield the hazard for us.

I would prefer my etnaviv don't introduce any config option.

Compile anywhere at any case.
