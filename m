The name of the API means that the *buffer* is coherent, i.e. both the 
device and CPU can access it at any time without needing any special 
synchronisation. How that is achieved depends on the device - if it is 
capable of snooping caches (i.e. marked as "dma-coherent" in DT) then 
that coherency is provided by hardware and the allocator doesn't need to 
do anything special; otherwise, it achieves coherency by making the CPU 
accesses non-cacheable.

Correct.

It absolutely matters. Linux has been told (by DT) that this device does 
not snoop caches, and therefore is acting on that information by using 
the non-cacheable remap. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, 
even when the "device" is actually firmware running on the same CPU - 
EL3 could well run with the MMU off, or just make a point of not 
accessing Non-Secure memory with cacheable attributes to avoid 
side-channels. However if in this case the SCM firmware *is* using 
cacheable attributes, as the symptoms would suggest, then either the 
firmware or the DT is wrong, and there is nothing Linux can do to 
completely fix that.

Right, and that's what the cache clean does. What Linux *cannot* 
guarantee is that said contents don't subsequently get pulled back into 
a cache in a manner which would break coherency if anyone was actually 
looking at the cache rather than RAM.

See the comment that the revert brings back - indeed it makes it less 
likely, but it's still possible that, say, the qcom_scm_assign_mem() 
thread gets preempted by an interrupt after dma_alloc_coherent() 
invalidates but before the buffer is completely written, and some access 
to an adjacent page during that period causes incomplete data to be 
prefetched back into the cache, and you're back to square one.

If Linux were actually expecting to get data back from the firmware, 
that would likely be even more broken (presuming it would use cacheable 
writes without a subsequent cache clean, given the implication that it's 
already doing cacheable reads without any maintenance of its own).

Having now looked at the SCM driver, TBH it doesn't make an awful lot of 
sense for it to be using dma_alloc_coherent() there anyway - it's not 
using it as a coherent buffer, it's doing a one-off unidirectional 
transfer of a relatively small amount of data in a manner which seems to 
be exactly the usage model for the streaming DMA API. And I think using 
the latter would happen to mitigate this problem too - with streaming 
DMA you'd put the dma_map_page() call *after* all the buffer data has 
been written, right before the SMC call, so even with a coherency 
mismatch there would essentially be no opportunity for the caches to get 
out of sync.

Thanks,
Robin.
