Hi Lizhi,

We all *love* "have you thought about xxx" questions but I would really like to
get your thoughts on this. An approach to this problem that I have seen in
various devices is to emulate a virtual pcie switch, and expose the "sub
devices" behind that. That way you can carve up the BAR space, each device has
its own config space and mapping of MSI-X vector to device becomes clear. This
approach also integrates well with other kernel infrastructure (IOMMU, hotplug).

This is certainly possible on reprogrammable devices but requires some more
FPGA resources - though I don't believe the added utilization would be
significant. What do you think of this kind of solution?
