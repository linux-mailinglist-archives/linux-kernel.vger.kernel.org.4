I agree, I used this mechanism because it was easier at first to rely on 
a previous work, but while I was working on the MBEC support, I realized 
that it's not the optimal way to do it.

I was thinking about using a new special EPT bit similar to 
EPT_SPTE_HOST_WRITABLE, but it may not be portable though. What do you 
think?
