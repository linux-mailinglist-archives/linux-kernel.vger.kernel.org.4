The presence of a Fixes: tag is already a strong indication that the
patch should be prioritized. Looking at the last 10 kernel releases,
here's the number of commits with a Fixes: tag in drivers/media/:

v5.14 - v5.15:    19
v5.15 - v5.16:    36
v5.16 - v5.17:    50
v5.17 - v5.18:    49
v5.18 - v5.19:    25
v5.19 - v6.0:     44
v6.0  - v6.1:     35
v6.1  - v6.2:     72
v6.2  - v6.3:     39
v6.3  - v6.4-rc1: 39

Some are likely not regressions and wouldn't need to be treated with the
highest priority, but keeping an eye on patches with a Fixes: tag seems
doable.

There's also the issue of regression fixes missing a Fixes: tag, but I
doubt those would get CC: regressions@lists.linux.dev, so from a mail
filtering point of view, that wouldn't help.
