Still, these numbers are for x86, which has KVM_INTERNAL_MEM_SLOTS
defined as 3.

As far as I can see aarch64 has KVM_INTERNAL_MEM_SLOTS equal to 0, so
this arch has 32766 slot available for the test memory.

Quick calculations show that this will result in 112 KiB of memory in
the last slot for 4 KiB page size (while for 64 KiB page size the
maximum slot count for this test is 8192 anyway - not counting slot 0).
