Ahh right. I was 50-50 on whether something like that was said so at
least I am not going crazy.

Yah, of all the windows to land patchsets that are being re-spun a few
days before it opens this probably isn't the best one to pick!

Aye, in RISC-V land maybe we will get there one day :)

For the original question though, breaking them up into 3 or 4 smaller
bits that could get applied on their own is probably a good idea?

Between yourselves, Drew and Prabhakar there's a couple series touching
the same bits. Certainly don't want to seem like I am speaking for the
Higher Powers here, but some sort of logical ordering would probably be
a good idea so as not to hold each other up?
The non-string bit of your series has been fairly well reviewed & would,
in theory, be mergeable once the tree re-opens? Timing aside, Jisheng's
idea seems like a good one, no?
