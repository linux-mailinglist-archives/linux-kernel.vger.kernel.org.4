It seems unrealistic to wish for BPF programs to be upstreamed, for
several reasons. A key benefit of BPF programs is that they are
decoupled from the kernel lifecycle and packaging. BPF programs are
often more tightly coupled with the application they are part of and
need to be maintained alongside those applications. There does not seem
to be any desire, process or incentive to maintain BPF programs in tree.

How about replacing 'other kfuncs may' with 'usually kfuncs will' to
re-emphasise that this would be the more common scenario.

Duplicate 'period'.
