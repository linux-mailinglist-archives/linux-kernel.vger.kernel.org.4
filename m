I also usually stick to features within the PTP spec[1], which includes
the locality support.

+2 for locality, I responded somewhere that I also support locality. I
was thinking more of TPM2_PolicyLocality I didn't realize that's
within the creationData. I was thinking more along the lines of, can I
wield the key over "did my locality create it". I'm not sure
what other protections are on the key,are there any protections
preventing them from
wielding it and using it to sign something nefarious?
