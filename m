When a stall occurs, can you tell where the time is lost?  E.g. is the CPU stuck
in L0, L1, or L2?  L2 being a single vCPU rules out quite a few scenarios, e.g.
lock contention and whatnot.

If you can run perf in WSL, that might be the easiest way to suss out what's going
on.

Hrm, not easily, no.  Can you try two things?

  1. Linus' tree on Intel hardware
  2. kvm-x86/next[*] on Intel hardware

Don't bother with #2 if #1 (Linus' tree) does NOT suffer the same stalls as AMD.
#2 is interesting iff Intel is also affected as kvm-x86/next has an optimization
for CR0.WP toggling, which was the achilles heel of the TDP MMU.  If Intel isn't
affected, then something other than CR0.WP is to blame.

I fully expect both experiments to show the same behavior as AMD, but if for some
reason they don't, the results should help narrow the search.
