At least if there is only one user of synchronize_rcu(), we can wake
it directly, i mean to invoke comlete() from the gp-kthread. I think
we should split such parts into different patches.

AFAICR the schedule_work() wants to use current CPU, indeed. For few
users it might be OK to comlete() them directly. Energy wise, +1 wake-up
of our worker to kick all users, if not "direct" option. I do not think
energy is a problem here.
