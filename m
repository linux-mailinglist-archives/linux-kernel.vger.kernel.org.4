x2apic_mode is set to 0 only in the case when nox2apic is specified in 
the kernel cmdline or if x2apic_setup fails. As 0xB leaf gets the 
"x2apic id" and not the "apic id", I thought it would be better to not 
use the x2apic id if the user doesnt want to use x2apic (cmdline), or 
the kernel fails to set it up.

Another thing I noticed from the Intel Architecture Manual CPUID—CPU 
Identification section:

"CPUID leaf 1FH is a preferred superset to leaf 0BH. Intel recommends 
first checking for the existence of Leaf 1FH before using leaf 0BH."

So I think we should switch from 0BH to using the 1FH leaf EDX register.

I think that makes sense, the patch only has a significant impact when 
the core count is high, and x2apic was made to support higher CPU count.

Just checked the wiki page, and it says core count is 1 :)
