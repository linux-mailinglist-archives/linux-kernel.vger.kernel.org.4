Hi,

Thanks for your feedback!

CONFIG_EFI_STUB_EXTRACT_DIRECT option was removed in v2 of the series
and direct extraction is unconditional now.

You are getting really weird errors, which unfortunately I am unable
to reproduce yet. I've tried booting with fedora's grub and the series
applied on top of ee6050c8af96, but it did boot successfully.

 From the error messages it's some problem with malloc() implementation
of compressed kernel code. I suspect that malloc_ptr inside .bss is not
zeroed. This should not happen when booting via either non-UEFI
interface, or via UEFI (when kernel is properly loaded as PE image).
The problem, I think, arises when kernel is loaded as a blob, but EFI
handover protocol is used to start its execution. This is what grub
seems to be doing.

Can you please try booting with patches below applied on top?
If this fixes the problem, I'll include these changes in v3.

Thanks,
Evgeniy Baskov
