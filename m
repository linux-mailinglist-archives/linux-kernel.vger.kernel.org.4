Great, that's useful information about why users would want to use
this parameter.

Obviously the other half is to mention the reasons why they may not be
able to use it.  If "msi_remap=off" were *always* safe and desirable,
we would just do that unconditionally and there would be no point in a
parameter.

No, a sysfs node is not the answer to this.  If we *can* avoid a
non-working situation, we should avoid it.  If users see a non-working
situation, they will rightly complain, and somebody will have to debug
it.  We don't want that.

My point is that apparently guest passthrough mode is relevant and
maybe it should be part of the commit log about how this parameter
should be used.
