Makes me wonder again if we should start adding

 CC: regressions@lists.linux.dev

to any patches that fix regressions, that way maintainers and reviewers
would have something to filter for -- and I would become aware of all
regression fixes in the work, too.

Ciao, Thorsten

P.S.: BTW, let me tell regzbot that Linus merged the fix for the build
failure.

#regzbot fix: ba0ad6ed89f

FWIW, the one for the gcc warnings[1] Laurent mentioned elsewhere in
this thread is not merged yet afaics.
