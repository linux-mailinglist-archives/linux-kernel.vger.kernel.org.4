I think there are a few more conversions missing. There's a local flags
variable in btrfs_init_workqueues

2175 static int btrfs_init_workqueues(struct btrfs_fs_info *fs_info)
2176 {
2177         u32 max_active = fs_info->thread_pool_size;
2178         unsigned int flags = WQ_MEM_RECLAIM | WQ_FREEZABLE | WQ_UNBOUND;

And used like

2194         fs_info->fixup_workers =
2195                 btrfs_alloc_workqueue(fs_info, "fixup", flags, 1, 0);

2213         fs_info->qgroup_rescan_workers =
2214                 btrfs_alloc_workqueue(fs_info, "qgroup-rescan", flags, 1, 0);

WQ_UNBOUND is not mentioned explicitliy like for the "btrfs_discard"
workqueue.  Patch v2 did the switch in btrfs_alloc_workqueue according
to the max_active/limit_active parameter but this would affect all
queues and not all of them require to be ordered.

In btrfs_resize_thread_pool the workqueue_set_max_active is called
directly or indirectly so this can set the max_active to a user-defined
mount option. Could this be a problem or trigger a warning? This would
lead to max_active==1 + WQ_UNBOUND.
