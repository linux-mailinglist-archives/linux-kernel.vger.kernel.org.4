Hi Luca, really sorry I seem to have completely missed your previous
email. Yes, moving the gdsc from PWRSTS_RET_ON to PWRSTS_OFF_ON seems to
be the right thing to do. The behavior of the RET state was same as that
of OFF prior to my patch, so the change should ideally make display go
back to having the same behavior as before.
I can certainly ack the change if you send in a patch.
thanks,
Rajendra
