I agree the original SEV was that weak; I've not seen anyone give a good
argument against SNP or TDX.

There were some talks at Plumbers where PCIe is working on adding that;
it's not there yet though.  I think that's PCIe 'Integrity and Data
Encryption' (IDE - sigh), and PCIe 'Security Prtocol and Data Model' -
SPDM.   I don't know much of the detail of those, just that they're far
enough off that people aren't depending on them yet.

That wouldn't help you necessarily for virtual devices - where the
hypervisor implements the device (like a virtual NIC).

We don't; you use LUKS2 on the disk and/or dm-verity; so there's no
trust in the disk.
You use whatever your favorite network encryption already is that
you're using to send data across the untrusted net.
So no trust in the data from the NIC.

Agreed; which again is why I only really worry about the subset of
devices I'd want in a CoCo VM.

I'd be kind of OK with that for the virtual devices; but:

  a) I think you'd start reinventing PCIe with enumeration etc

  b) We do want those pass through NICs etc that are PCIe
    - as long as you use normal guest crypto stuff then the host
    can be just as nasty as it likes with the data they present.

  c) The world has enough bus protocols, and people understand the
   basics of PCI(e) - we really don't need another one.

What protection?  I know we have an IOMMU, and that stops the device
stamping all over RAM by itself - but I think Intel's worries are more
subtle, things where the device starts playing with what PCI devices
are expected to do to try and trigger untested kernel paths.  I don't
think there's protection against that.
I know we can lock by PCI/USB vendor/device ID - but those can be made
up trivially; protection like that is meaningless.

Because:
   a) there's no good way to authenticate a PCI device yet
     - any nasty device can claim to have a given PCI ID.
   b) Even if you could, there's no man-in-the-middle protection yet.

Lets say you get something like a ACPI table or qemu fw.cfg table
giving details of your devices; if the hypervisor builds those in a
nasty way what happens?

That's probably fair to some degree - the people looking at this are VM
people, not desktop people; I'm not sure what the overlap is; but as I
say above, I don't think the protection currently available really help
here.  Please show us where we're wrong.

Sure;  I'm seeing existing implementations being used in vendors clouds
at the moment, and they're slowly getting the security people want.
I'd like to see that being done with upstream kernels and firmware.
