Yes.  Before this patch series we had two panic scenarios:

(a) Endpoint devices with no CLKREQ# connection
(b) Endpoints that are L1SS-capable

Even without  the "brcm,enable-l1ss" property present, both (a) and
(b) should be eliminated.
The reason (b) is eliminated is because the RC driver now unadvertises
 RC L1SS by default; subsequently, Linux does
not turn it on.  So the default setting should be fine for all devices.

For those folks who have L1SS capable devices and desire L1SS power
savings, they can add
the brcm,enable-l1ss property.  But everyone should have functionality
 w/o doing anything.

As I am typing this I realize that my comments and dev_info()s  are not
aligned with what I am saying so I will change them in V3.  Sorry
about the confusion.

Let me test everything on Monday and get back to you before I make any
statements.
