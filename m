That's an interesting question, and to some extent, that is actually
what Evgeny's patch does: execute more of what the decompressor does
from inside the EFI runtime context.

The main win with zboot imho is that we get rid of all the funky
heuristics that look for usable memory for trampolines and
decompression buffers in funky ways, and instead, just use the EFI
APIs for allocating pages and remapping them executable as needed
(which is the important piece here) I'd have to think about whether
there is any middle ground between this approach and Evgeny's - I'll
have to get back to you on that.

and zeroed, and the result was an incredible mess =E2=80=94 IIRC the decomp=

el, which is gross.

Zboot pads the image to include BSS, so that the zboot metadata covers
the actual memory footprint of the image rather than just the image
size, and it will get zeroed out as a result of the decompression too,
which is a nice bonus. I did this mainly to try and make it idiot
proof for other (non-EFI) consumers of the zboot header and compressed
payload, but it means that the zboot EFI loader doesn't have to bother
either.
