Ok, thanks, I'll improve them again.

Ok, thanks, I'll specify spec version with correct pattern.

Yes, no mentions for the inverter in ACPI spec, the description about
device interrupt type can be found in Loongson chipset manual:

https://github.com/loongson/LoongArch-Documentation/blob/main/docs/Loongson-7A1000-usermanual-EN/interrupt-controller/device-interrupt-types.adoc

where the interrupts coming from interrupt source are level triggered 
and active high except some specific device such as AC97 DMA and GPIO.

Ok, thanks.

Just like GIC is restricted to ARM, and LPIC is restricted to LoongArch, 
as you mentioned below. So LPIC model will be not used on non-LoongArch 
systems.

Though the definition and constraints for GIC and LPIC are explicitly 
expressed in ACPI spec, to be clear, repeating the relation here only 
with short words maybe worthy so that people understand the workaround 
conveniently without having to referencing ACPI spec, right?
