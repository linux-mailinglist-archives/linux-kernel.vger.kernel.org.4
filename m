This condition in __get_task_ioprio():

        if (IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(prio) == IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE)
                prio = IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE(task_nice_ioclass(p),
                                         task_nice_ioprio(p));

sets task's IO priority based on scheduling priority.

OK, so it seems we are all in agreement here that "none-to-rt" behavior is
not really needed. Hou, can you perhaps update your patches and the
documentation to make "none-to-rt" just an alias for "promote-to-rt"?
Thanks!
