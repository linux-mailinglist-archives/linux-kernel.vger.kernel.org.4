Hello!

Would not it better to rather synthesise PCIe Slot Capabilities support
in your PCIe Root Port device (e.g. via pci-bridge-emul.c) and then let
existing PCI hotplug code to take care for hotplugging? Because it
already implements all required stuff for re-scanning, registering and
unregistering PCIe devices for Root Ports with Slot Capabilities. And I
think that there is no need to have just another (GPIO based)
implementation of PCI hotplug.

Similar thing Marek and me have implemented for PCIe link state events
in patch series with Lukas pointed.
