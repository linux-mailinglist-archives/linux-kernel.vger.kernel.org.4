That's an argument for never using initcalls (not a bad one either). But 
we have them and we have little reason not to use them. Also, it's 
better to do things as late as possible I've found. The earlier you do 
things, the more architecture specific stuff you hit. That's a big 
reason for the remaining differences in FDT init across architectures. 
Maybe after setup_arch is late enough. IDK.

I get the logic. I'd just rather not add another hook between the DT 
code and the core/arch code. Especially for this niche usecase.

We already have the secondary init when sysfs is up. Can't we just do 
this there?

Uhh, no!
