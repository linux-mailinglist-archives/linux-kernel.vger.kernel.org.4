Hi Rafael,

This update is only for replacing the current trip array when one or 
several trip points are added or removed. We can see that in one or two 
drivers only.

This function is supposed to be called rarely (and I doubt there is 
really a lot of hardware sending notification to add/remove trip points).

For changing a trip point property like its temperature or its 
hysteresis, we keep the usual set_trip_point() function.

No, that will be a side effect. We can put this point apart, it will be 
addressed in a cleanup series after everything is converted to the 
generic trip points.

IMO, that is over-engineered, especially for dedicating this 
optimization for a very few drivers and ultra rare usages.

Actually, the driver is not supposed to deal with the array. It can 
create the array on the stack, pass it to the 
thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips() function and forget about it.

The trip points array should not be used by a driver anymore.

I'm not sure to understand. The core code is called with this function 
and takes the lock.

Yes, that is why I think the adding/removal of the trip points was never 
really supported. I would be very curious to see a platform with such a 
feature.

The userspace can be notified when there is a change with:

THERMAL_GENL_EVENT_TZ_TRIP_CHANGE
THERMAL_GENL_EVENT_TZ_TRIP_ADD
THERMAL_GENL_EVENT_TZ_TRIP_DELETE

The last two ones are not implemented today but that could be done after 
as that would be a new feature.

Let me summarize the situation:

  - The trip point crossing events are not correctly detected because of 
how they are handled and we need to sort them out.

  - In order to sort them out, we need to convert the drivers to the 
generic trip point and remove all those get_trip_* | set_trip_* ops

  - Almost all the drivers are converted except the ACPI thermal and the 
intel_soc_dts_iosf drivers which are blocking the feature

  - The ACPI thermal driver can potentially add or remove a trip point 
but we are not sure that can happen

  - We need to decorrelate the trip id and the array index for the ACPI 
thermal driver

The generic trip points change is a big chunk of work and I would like 
to have some progress to fix the trip crossing detection along with the 
removal of the resulting dead code.

Given there may not be a real usage of the thermal trip number update, 
can we stay simple and keep the proposed change but forcing the same 
number of trip points ?

We can then improve the existing code if it is really needed
