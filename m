It seems like lockdep needs to hit the tear down path in order to
detect the circular lock dependency. Perhaps you don't hit that on your
sc7180/sc7280? 

It is due to the fact that the panel is looked up way too late so that
bind fails unless the panel driver is already loaded when the msm drm
driver probes.

Manually loading the panel driver before msm makes the splat go away.

I think this is indeed a new problem related to some of the devfreq work
you did in 6.3-rc1 (e.g. fadcc3ab1302 ("drm/msm/gpu: Bypass PM QoS
constraint for idle clamp")).

That's the series I link to below, but IIRC it did not look directly
applicable to the splat I see on X13s (e.g. does not involve
fs_reclaim).
