Why not?  I assume Intel put a fair bit of effort into ensuring feature parity
between P and E cores.  Other than time, money, and effort, I don't see any
reason why Intel can't do the same for the PMU.

I don't disagree, but I don't think that's relevant in this case.  Perf doesn't
provide the necessary bits for KVM to virtualize a hybrid PMU, so unless KVM is
somehow able to get away with enumerating a very stripped down vPMU, additional
modifications to perf_get_x86_pmu_capability() will be required.

What I care more about though is this ugliness in perf_get_x86_pmu_capability():

	/*
	 * KVM doesn't support the hybrid PMU yet.
	 * Return the common value in global x86_pmu,
	 * which available for all cores.
	 */
	cap->num_counters_gp	= x86_pmu.num_counters;

I really don't want to leave that comment lying around as it's flat out wrong in
that it obviously doesn't address the other differences beyond the number of
counters.  And since there are dependencies on perf, my preference is to disable
PMU enumeration in perf specifically so that whoever takes on vPMU enabling is
forced to consider the perf side of things, and get buy in from the perf folks.
