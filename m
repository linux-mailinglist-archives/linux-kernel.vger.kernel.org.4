I looked again at the code and specifically the use case that triggers
the crash in bugzilla. I *think* (correct me if I am wrong), that the
only operation that QEMU performs right now is "grow/shrink".

So *if* we want to go this way, we could start with a simple grow/shrink
API.

Even though we need to consider that this could bring additional
complexity in QEMU. Currently, DELETE+CREATE (grow/shrink) is not
performed one after the other (in my innocent fantasy I was expecting to
find 2 subsequent ioctls in the code), but in QEMU's
address_space_set_flatview(), which seems to first remove all regions
and then add them when changing flatviews.

address_space_update_topology_pass(as, old_view2, new_view, adding=false);
address_space_update_topology_pass(as, old_view2, new_view, adding=true);

I don't think we can change this, as other listeners also rely on such
ordering, but we can still batch all callback requests like I currently
do and process them in kvm_commit(), figuring there which operation is
which.

In other words, we would have something like:

region_del() --> DELETE memslot X -> add it to the queue of operations
region_del() --> DELETE memslot Y -> add it to the queue of operations
region_add() --> CREATE memslot X (size doubled) -> add it to the queue
of operations
region_add() --> CREATE memslot Y (size halved) -> add it to the queue
of operations
...
commit() --> scan QUEUE and figure what to do -> GROW X (+size), SHRINK
Y (-size) -> issue 2 ioctls, GROW and SHRINK.

So essentially grow would not require INVALIDATE. Makes sense, but would
it work also with shrink? I guess so, as the memslot is still present
(but shrinked) right?

Paolo, would you be ok with this smaller API? Probably just starting
with grow and shrink first.

I am not against any of the two approaches:
- my approach has the disadvantage that the list could be arbitrarily
long, and it is difficult to rollback the intermediate changes if
something breaks during the request processing (but could be simplified
by making kvm exit or crash).

- Sean approach could potentially provide more burden to the userspace,
as we need to figure which operation is which. Also from my
understanding split and merge won't be really straightforward to
implement, especially in userspace.

David, any concern from userspace prospective on this "CISC" approach?

Thank you,
Emanuele
