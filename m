Thanks for pointing out the DMA mask references during platform device
allocation. I wasn't aware of that. However, I still have issues with using
ZONE_DMA32. See comments on how we can address this here:

I'm fine with this, but others will need to approve of that.

I'm not okay with this as it re-introduces the dependency on ZONE_DMA32.
I responded with more details here with regards to why and how we can work
around the ARCH issues with dma_alloc_coherent():
