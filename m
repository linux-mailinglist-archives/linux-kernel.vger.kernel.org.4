I have double checked the synchronization and we need here:

	/*
	 * Make sure klp_update_patch_state() and __klp_sched_try_switch()
	 * see the updated klp_target_state before TIF_PATCH_PENDING
	 * is set again in klp_start_transition().
	 */
	smp_wmb();

The same is achieved by smp_wmb() in klp_init_transition().

Note that the extra barrier was missing here because klp_target_state
was set before klp_synchronize_transition(). It was fine because
klp_update_patch_state() was called on locations where a transition
in any direction was always safe.

Just for record. We need to modify @klp_target_state after
klp_synchronize_transition() now. The value is used by
__klp_sched_try_switch() to decide when the transition
is safe. It defines what functions must not be on the stack.

I am sorry that I missed this when reviewing v1. I think that I needed
to see the new code with a fresh head.

I do not see any other problem. With the above barrier added,
feel free to use:

It is for the livepatching part. I checked also the scheduler
code and it looked fine but I would not put my hand in the fire
for it.

Best Regards,
Petr
