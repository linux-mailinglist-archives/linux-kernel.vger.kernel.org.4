I guess I should have asked "what bad things happen without this patch
and without the DT 'disabled' status"?

I think 6fffbc7ae137 ("PCI: Honor firmware's device disabled status")
was basically a workaround for Loongson making a device visible in PCI
config space when it shouldn't have been [1].

6fffbc7ae137 [2] means we pretend the PCI device doesn't exist if DT
status is "disabled".  If the device happens to be Function 0, that
means we don't look for any more functions.  I guess that doesn't
matter for Loongson.  But it does matter for this NXP platform, where
we don't want to use Function 0, but we *do* want to use other
Functions.

There are several PCIe things that are required to be in Function 0
(MPS, ASPM, IDE, CMA/SPDM, etc), at least in certain cases.

What would happen if instead of making pci_setup_device() fail (as
both 6fffbc7ae137 and this patch do, which means the device doesn't
even show up in "lspci"), we just prevent drivers from binding to it,
e.g., by making pci_device_probe() fail?  The device would then appear
in "lspci" and the PCI core would configure things as usual, but no
drivers would be able to claim it.
