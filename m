One thing that is not really clear to me is whether those pins do
actually have any "ownership". The interface itself doesn't talk about
anything like that and so it seems perfectly fine to unpin from a
completely different context then pinning. If there is no enforcement
then Tejun is right and relying on memcg ownership is likely the only
reliable way to use for tracking. The downside is sharing obviously but
this is the same problem we already do deal with with shared pages.

Another thing that is not really clear to me is how the limit is
actually going to be used in practice. As there is no concept of a
reclaim for pins then I can imagine that it would be quite easy to
reach the hard limit and essentially DoS any further use of pins. Cross
cgroup pinning would make it even worse because it could become a DoS
vector very easily. Practically speaking what tends to be a corner case
in the memcg limit world would be norm for pin based limit.

Or am I misunderstanding something here?
