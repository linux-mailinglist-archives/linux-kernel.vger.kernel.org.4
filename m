Just to be clear on that point, I do not want to avoid any reviews and Lee's
reviews are fully welcome.

I just misunderstood. I thought the issue was that the pef2256 MFD driver has an
internal setup() and that the 'function' provided were not independent (they share
the pef2256 API).
My first feeling was that it was expected a kind of 'empty' driver for the pef2256
MFD driver. The pef2256 driver cannot be empty. That's why I talk about misc.

Related to pinctrl, the probe() orders need to be controlled but that would not be
an issue if I move the pinctrl part to pinctrl. I would like also to avoid
exporting all registers. Only the pinctrl part needs to access registers and
it needs to access a few of them.

Is there a way to restrict the registers available from a child ?
