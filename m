Hello Cyril,

I'm still seeing things in the logs that do not make sense to me.

First, the "unpatched" version logs -- including the Raspian case --
all have the following lines:

    [    0.000000] Movable zone start for each node
    /* ... */
    [    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: s88232 r8192 d30552 u126976 alloc=3D31*4096
    [    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: [0] 0 [0] 1 [0] 2 [0] 3

The above lines are also in my logs.  But they are missing from your
"after patch" logs -- what did you  change to have these lines
disappear on the patched logs?

Second, you say that you used a different "CM4" from the one used in
the Bugzilla  report -- what do you mean by that?   Are you referring
to the CM4 module proper, whose only change was going from 4GB to 8GB,
or the IO board being used?  My  testing is done with a standard RPi
CM4 and standard RPi IO board.  Before this patch series, the only way
this standard configuration can work for most hobbyist PCI cards (i.e.
floating CLKREQ# pin) is by using Raspian AND adding
"brcm,enable-l1ss" to the DT node.

I'm guessing that you are using the configuration that you described
to me in  a personal email: "[the] chip is embedded directly on the
modified PCB, as opposed to plugged into the PCIe slot on the official
CM4 IO Board".  If true, you are testing on a configuration that (a)
is unique to you and your group and (b) must be doing something with
the CLKREQ# signal so that your "before" case does not panic.  Is this
the case?

Finally, and this is a big one, is the fact that in both of the
"before" and "after" cases the value written to the internal Brcm
CLKREQ# register is the same.
This is evident by this line in the "after" patch:  "brcm-pcie
fd500000.pcie: uni-dir CLKREQ# for ASPM".  This mode is the only mode
supported by the "before"
case.  Now there are  some other things going on in the patch series
-- reading two registers and extending the timeout value of a
completion abort, but I'm having
a hard time imagining how they could cause a panic.

Regards,
Jim

PS  Can you please include in your logs the output of  "sudo lspci
-vvv" for those cases that boot to prompt?
