I don't think that works.  As I mentioned to Thomas elsewhere, you don't
just need to initialize TDX on the CPUs where it is used.  Before the
module will start working you need to initialize it on *all* the CPUs it
knows about.  The module itself has a little counter where it tracks
this and will refuse to start being useful until it gets called
thoroughly enough.

I went looking for it in this series to prove you wrong.  I failed.  :)

tdx_enable() is buried in here somewhere:

I don't have the patience to dig it out today, so I guess we'll have Kai
tell us.

Yep, that makes total sense.  Kai had one in an earlier version but I
made him throw it out because it wasn't *strictly* required and this set
is fat enough.

So, if we just use schedule_on_cpu() for now and have the TDX code wait,
will a NOHZ_FULL task just block the schedule_on_cpu() indefinitely?

That doesn't seem like _horrible_ behavior to start off with for a
minimal series.
