===Feature Introduction===

Linear-address masking (LAM) [1], modifies the checking that is applied to
*64-bit* linear addresses, allowing software to use of the untranslated address
bits for metadata and masks the metadata bits before using them as linear 
addresses to access memory.

When the feature is virtualized and exposed to guest, it can be used for efficient
address sanitizers (ASAN) implementation and for optimizations in JITs and virtual
machines.

Regarding which pointer bits are masked and can be used for metadata, LAM has 2
modes:
- LAM_48: metadata bits 62:48, i.e. LAM width of 15.
- LAM_57: metadata bits 62:57, i.e. LAM width of 6.

* For user pointers:
  CR3.LAM_U57 = CR3.LAM_U48 = 0, LAM is off;
  CR3.LAM_U57 = 1, LAM57 is active;
  CR3.LAM_U57 = 0 and CR3.LAM_U48 = 1, LAM48 is active.
* For supervisor pointers: 
  CR4.LAM_SUP =0, LAM is off;
  CR4.LAM_SUP =1 with 5-level paging mode, LAM57 is active;
  CR4.LAM_SUP =1 with 4-level paging mode, LAM48 is active.

The modified LAM canonicality check:
* LAM_S48                : [ 1 ][ metadata ][ 1 ]
                             63               47
* LAM_U48                : [ 0 ][ metadata ][ 0 ]
                             63               47
* LAM_S57                : [ 1 ][ metadata ][ 1 ]
                             63               56
* LAM_U57 + 5-lvl paging : [ 0 ][ metadata ][ 0 ]
                             63               56
* LAM_U57 + 4-lvl paging : [ 0 ][ metadata ][ 0...0 ]
                             63               56..47

Note:
1. LAM applies to only data address, not to instructions.
2. LAM identification of an address as user or supervisor is based solely on the
   value of pointer bit 63 and does not depend on the CPL.
3. LAM doesn't apply to the writes to control registers or MSRs.
4. LAM masking applies before paging, so the faulting linear address in CR2
   doesn't contain the metadata.
5  The guest linear address saved in VMCS doesn't contain metadata.
6. For user mode address, it is possible that 5-level paging and LAM_U48 are both
   set, in this case, the effective usable linear address width is 48.
   (Currently, only LAM_U57 is enabled in Linux kernel. [2])

===LAM KVM Design===
LAM KVM enabling includes the following parts:
- Feature Enumeration
  LAM feature is enumerated by CPUID.7.1:EAX.LAM[bit 26].
  If hardware supports LAM and host doesn't disable it explicitly (e.g. via 
  clearcpuid), LAM feature will be exposed to user VMM.

- CR4 Virtualization
  LAM uses CR4.LAM_SUP (bit 28) to configure LAM on supervisor pointers.
  Add support to allow guests to set the new CR4 control bit for guests to enable
  LAM on supervisor pointers.

- CR3 Virtualization
  LAM uses CR3.LAM_U48 (bit 62) and CR3.LAM_U57 (bit 61) to configure LAM on user
  pointers.
  Add support to allow guests to set two new CR3 non-address control bits for
  guests to enable LAM on user pointers.

- Modified Canonicality Check and Metadata Mask
  When LAM is enabled, 64-bit linear address may be tagged with metadata. Linear
  address should be checked for modified canonicality and untagged in instruction
  emulations and VMExit handlers when LAM is applicable.

LAM support in SGX enclave mode needs additional enabling and is not
included in this patch series.

LAM QEMU patch:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2023-05/msg07843.html

LAM kvm-unit-tests patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20230530024356.24870-1-binbin.wu@linux.intel.com/

===Test===
1. Add test cases in kvm-unit-test [3] for LAM, including LAM_SUP and LAM_{U57,U48}.
   For supervisor pointers, the test covers CR4 LAM_SUP bits toggle, Memory/MMIO
   access with tagged pointer, and some special instructions (INVLPG, INVPCID,
   INVVPID), INVVPID cases also used to cover VMX instruction VMExit path.
   For uer pointers, the test covers CR3 LAM bits toggle, Memory/MMIO access with
   tagged pointer.
   MMIO cases are used to trigger instruction emulation path.
   Run the unit test with both LAM feature on/off (i.e. including negative cases).
   Run the unit test in L1 guest with both LAM feature on/off.
2. Run Kernel LAM kselftests [2] in guest, with both EPT=Y/N.
3. Launch a nested guest.

All tests have passed in Simics environment.

Changelog
v8 --> v9:
- Remove unnecessary local variables and some modification of commit message of patch 1. [Chao, David, Kai]
- Add back description about CR4.LAM_SUP setting outside of 64-bit mode in commit message of patch 2. [Kai]
- Clear LAM bits from cr3_ctrl_bits if LAM isn't exposed to the guest in patch 3. [Chao]
- Some comments and commit message changes in patch 4. [Chao]
- Use 'gva_t *' instead of 'u64 *' to avoid explicit type casts in patch 5. [Chao]

v7 --> v8:
- Rebase the patch series on Linux kernel v6.4-rc1, which has all dependencies
  of this patch series.
- Add a cleanup patch to consolidate flags for __linearize().

- Add Chao Gao's reviewed-by in Patch 5.
- Add Xuelian Guo's tested-by in the patch set.
- Separate cleanup patches from the patch set.

v5 --> v6:
Add Patch 2 to fix the check of 64-bit mode.
Add untag_addr() to kvm_x86_ops to hide vendor specific code.
Simplify the LAM canonicality check per Chao's suggestion.

version.
Revise Patch 1's subject and description
Drop Patch 3
Use kvm_read_cr4_bits() instead of kvm_read_cr4()
Fix: No need to untag addr when write to msr, it should be legacy canonical check
Rename kvm_is_valid_cr3() --> kvm_vcpu_is_valid_cr3(), and update some call
sites of kvm_vcpu_is_valid_cr3() to use kvm_is_valid_cr3().
Other refactors and Miscs.

v3 --> v4:
Drop unrelated Patch 1 in v3 (Binbin, Sean, Xiaoyao)
Intercept CR4.LAM_SUP instead of pass through to guest (Sean)
Just filter out CR3.LAM_{U48, U57}, instead of all reserved high bits
(Sean, Yuan)
Use existing __canonical_address() helper instead write a new one (Weijiang)
