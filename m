I've considered using similar approach when I was writing my series.
That looks great if you look at subject without considering backwards
compatibility, especially due to the increased code sharing and the 
usage
of the code path without all the legacy stuff. But, I think, that zboot
approach have two downsides:

* Most distros won't use it, due to backward compatibility, so they 
won't
   benefit the improvements.
* Those distros that would potentially use it, have to be either
   DIY-ish like Gentoo, or provide both kernels during installation.
   So it either complicates installation process or installer logic.

It might work for UEFI-only distros, but those won't be a majority for a
little while for x86, I think. Because it's very likely that a lot of 
people
will complain if distro provides zboot-only kernel (considering that the
same story with the handover protocol). Backward compatibility is evil.

So, I think, at least for now, it would still be better to change 
existing
extraction code and stay compatible, despite it being harder and less 
clean...

(zboot also lacks the support for some kernel options, like ones used 
for
tweaking memory map; mixed mode support and probably the handling of
CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE, but that's an RFC, so this comment is largely
irrelevant for now.)

Thanks,
