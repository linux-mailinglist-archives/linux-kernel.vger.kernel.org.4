It is a rough rule of thumb.  For more details and accuracy, study up
on the Student's t-test and related statistical tests.

Of course, this all assumes that the data fits a normal distribution.

The range is 8.2 through 9.8.

The range is 7.7 through 9.8.

There is again significant overlap, so it is again unclear that you have
a statistically significant difference.  So could you please calculate
the standard deviations?

The meaning of 0.5 is the probability of a given data point being on one
side or the other of the corresponding distribution's median.  This of
course assumes that the median of the measured data matches that of the
corresponding distribution, though the fact that the median is also a
mode of both of the old data sets gives some hope.

The meaning of the 0.1 is the smallest difference that the data could
measure.  I could have instead chosen 0.0 and asked if there was likely
some (perhaps tiny) difference, but instead, I chose to ask if there
was likely some small but meaningful difference.  It is better to choose
the desired difference before measuring the data.

Why don't you try applying this approach to the new data?  You will need
the general binomial formula.
