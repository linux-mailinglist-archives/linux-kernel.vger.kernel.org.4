It should be possible.  It's populated by the PSP/VBIOS at power up,
so all you need to do is read the right offset in vram.  For
firmwares, we currently read them from the filesystem from the
relevant IP code, but we could also just read it in amdgpu_discovery.c
when we walk the IP discovery table.
