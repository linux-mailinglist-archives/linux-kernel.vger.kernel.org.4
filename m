Quoting:
"
Unfortunately a side effect of this change is that now since
PTR_TO_BTF_ID without ref_obj_id is considered trusted, the bpf_ct_*
functions would begin working with tp_btf args.
"
I couldn't find any tracepoint that has nf_conn___init as an argument.
The whole point of that new type was to return it to bpf prog,
so the verifier type matches it when it's passed into bpf_ct_*
in turn.
So I don't see a need for a new OWNED flag still.
If nf_conn___init is passed into tracepoint it's a bug and
we gotta fix it.

That is still the plan. more or less.

Right. Backward compat with existing usage of PTR_TO_BTF_ID
is the main issue.

I kind agree, but we gotta have both because of backward compat.
We cannot change PTR_TO_BTF_ID as a whole right now.

Note PTR_TO_BTF_ID appears in kfuncs too.
I'm proposing to use PTR_TO_BTF_ID | PTR_TRUSTED
only in tracepoint args and as return value from
certain helpers like bpf_get_current_task_btf().
afaik it's all safe. There is no uaf here.
uaf is for kfunc. Especially fexit.
Those will stay PTR_TO_BTF_ID. Without PTR_TRUSTED.

Eventually either PTR_TRUSTED or PTR_UNTRUSTED will be removed.
