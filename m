Patch 3 (the fix to the ftrace test) does not depend upon patches 1 and 2. It
probably would've been better to queue that as a preparatory fix before the
other changes.

Patch 4 (adding arm64 support to the samples) depends on patch 3. The arm64
parts depends upon patch 1 to be selectable, and without patch 1 the samples
will behave the same as before. It could be queued independently of patch 1,
but won't have any effect until merged with patch 1.

Patch 5 (the bpf selftest list changes) depends on patch 1 alone.

Perhaps we could queue 1 and 2 via the arm64 tree, 3 and 4 via the ftrace tree,
and follow up with patch 5 via the bpf tree after -rc1?

Thanks,
Mark.
