Huh, great catch!

It is just for the stack in the process context. Right?

I think that I have never seen a stack with over 50 entries. And in
the worst case, a bigger amount of entries would "just" result in
a non-reliable stack which might be acceptable.

It looks acceptable to me.

> Alternatively we could have a percpu entries array... :-/

That said, percpu entries would be fine as well. It sounds like
a good price for the livepatching feature. I think that livepatching
is used on big systems anyway.

I slightly prefer the per-cpu solution.
