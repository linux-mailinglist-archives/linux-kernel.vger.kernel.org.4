Extend the bpf hashmap docs to include a brief description of the
internals of the LRU map type (setting appropriate API expectations),
including the original commit message from Martin and a variant on the
graph that I had presented during my Linux Plumbers Conference 2022 talk
on "Pressure feedback for LRU map types"[0].

The node names in the dot file correspond roughly to the functions where
the logic for those decisions or steps is defined, to help curious
developers to cross-reference and update this logic if the details of
the LRU implementation ever differ from this description.

+This section of the document is targeted at Linux developers and describes

+
+``BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH`` and variants
+--------------------------------------
+
+An LRU hashmap type consists of two properties: Firstly, it is a hash map and
+hence is indexable by key for constant time lookups. Secondly, when at map
+capacity, map updates will trigger eviction of old entries based on the age of
+the elements in a set of lists. Each of these properties may be either global
+or per-CPU, depending on the map type and flags used to create the map:

+
+        bpf: LRU List
+
+        Introduce bpf_lru_list which will provide LRU capability to
+        the bpf_htab in the later patch.
+
+        * General Thoughts:
+        1. Target use case.  Read is more often than update.
+           (i.e. bpf_lookup_elem() is more often than bpf_update_elem()).
+           If bpf_prog does a bpf_lookup_elem() first and then an in-place
+           update, it still counts as a read operation to the LRU list concern.
+        2. It may be useful to think of it as a LRU cache
+        3. Optimize the read case
+           3.1 No lock in read case
+           3.2 The LRU maintenance is only done during bpf_update_elem()
+        4. If there is a percpu LRU list, it will lose the system-wise LRU
+           property.  A completely isolated percpu LRU list has the best
+           performance but the memory utilization is not ideal considering
+           the work load may be imbalance.
+        5. Hence, this patch starts the LRU implementation with a global LRU
+           list with batched operations before accessing the global LRU list.
+           As a LRU cache, #read >> #update/#insert operations, it will work well.
+        6. There is a local list (for each cpu) which is named
+           'struct bpf_lru_locallist'.  This local list is not used to sort
+           the LRU property.  Instead, the local list is to batch enough
+           operations before acquiring the lock of the global LRU list.  More
+           details on this later.
+        7. In the later patch, it allows a percpu LRU list by specifying a
+           map-attribute for scalability reason and for use cases that need to
+           prepare for the worst (and pathological) case like DoS attack.
+           The percpu LRU list is completely isolated from each other and the
+           LRU nodes (including free nodes) cannot be moved across the list.  The
+           following description is for the global LRU list but mostly applicable
+           to the percpu LRU list also.
+
+        * Global LRU List:
+        1. It has three sub-lists: active-list, inactive-list and free-list.
+        2. The two list idea, active and inactive, is borrowed from the
+           page cache.
+        3. All nodes are pre-allocated and all sit at the free-list (of the
+           global LRU list) at the beginning.  The pre-allocation reasoning
+           is similar to the existing BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH.  However,
+           opting-out prealloc (BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC) is not supported in
+           the LRU map.
+
+        * Active/Inactive List (of the global LRU list):
+        1. The active list, as its name says it, maintains the active set of
+           the nodes.  We can think of it as the working set or more frequently
+           accessed nodes.  The access frequency is approximated by a ref-bit.
+           The ref-bit is set during the bpf_lookup_elem().
+        2. The inactive list, as its name also says it, maintains a less
+           active set of nodes.  They are the candidates to be removed
+           from the bpf_htab when we are running out of free nodes.
+        3. The ordering of these two lists is acting as a rough clock.
+           The tail of the inactive list is the older nodes and
+           should be released first if the bpf_htab needs free element.
+
+        * Rotating the Active/Inactive List (of the global LRU list):
+        1. It is the basic operation to maintain the LRU property of
+           the global list.
+        2. The active list is only rotated when the inactive list is running
+           low.  This idea is similar to the current page cache.
+           Inactive running low is currently defined as
+           "# of inactive < # of active".
+        3. The active list rotation always starts from the tail.  It moves
+           node without ref-bit set to the head of the inactive list.
+           It moves node with ref-bit set back to the head of the active
+           list and then clears its ref-bit.
+        4. The inactive rotation is pretty simply.
+           It walks the inactive list and moves the nodes back to the head of
+           active list if its ref-bit is set. The ref-bit is cleared after moving
+           to the active list.
+           If the node does not have ref-bit set, it just leave it as it is
+           because it is already in the inactive list.
+
+        * Shrinking the Inactive List (of the global LRU list):
+        1. Shrinking is the operation to get free nodes when the bpf_htab is
+           full.
+        2. It usually only shrinks the inactive list to get free nodes.
+        3. During shrinking, it will walk the inactive list from the tail,
+           delete the nodes without ref-bit set from bpf_htab.
+        4. If no free node found after step (3), it will forcefully get
+           one node from the tail of inactive or active list.  Forcefully is
+           in the sense that it ignores the ref-bit.
+
+        * Local List:
+        1. Each CPU has a 'struct bpf_lru_locallist'.  The purpose is to
+           batch enough operations before acquiring the lock of the
+           global LRU.
+        2. A local list has two sub-lists, free-list and pending-list.
+        3. During bpf_update_elem(), it will try to get from the free-list
+           of (the current CPU local list).
+        4. If the local free-list is empty, it will acquire from the
+           global LRU list.  The global LRU list can either satisfy it
+           by its global free-list or by shrinking the global inactive
+           list.  Since we have acquired the global LRU list lock,
+           it will try to get at most LOCAL_FREE_TARGET elements
+           to the local free list.
+        5. When a new element is added to the bpf_htab, it will
+           first sit at the pending-list (of the local list) first.
+           The pending-list will be flushed to the global LRU list
+           when it needs to acquire free nodes from the global list
+           next time.
+
+        * Lock Consideration:
+        The LRU list has a lock (lru_lock).  Each bucket of htab has a
+        lock (buck_lock).  If both locks need to be acquired together,
+        the lock order is always lru_lock -> buck_lock and this only
+        happens in the bpf_lru_list.c logic.
+
+        In hashtab.c, both locks are not acquired together (i.e. one
+        lock is always released first before acquiring another lock).

+
+Notably, there are various steps that the update algorithm attempts in order to
+enforce the LRU property which have increasing impacts on other CPUs involved
+in the operations:
+
+- Attempt to use CPU-local state to batch operations
+- Attempt to fetch free nodes from global lists
+- Attempt to pull any node from a global list and remove it from the hashmap
+- Attempt to pull any node from any CPU's list and remove it from the hashmap
+
+Even if an LRU node may be acquired, maps of type ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH``
+may fail to insert the entry into the map if other CPUs are heavily contending
+on the global hashmap lock.
+
+This algorithm is described visually in the following diagram:
+
+.. kernel-figure::  map_lru_hash_update.dot
+   :alt:    Diagram outlining the LRU eviction steps taken during map update
+
+   LRU hash eviction during map update for ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH`` and
+   variants
+
+Map updates start from the oval in the top right "begin ``bpf_map_update()``"
+and progress through the graph towards the bottom where the result may be
+either a successful update or a failure with various error codes. The key in
+the top right provides indicators for which locks may be involved in specific
+operations. This is intended as a visual hint for reasoning about how map
+contention may impact update operations, though the map type and flags may
+impact the actual contention on those locks, based on the logic described in
+the table above. For instance, if the map is created with type
+``BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_PERCPU_HASH`` and flags ``BPF_NO_COMMON_LRU`` then all map
+properties would be per-cpu.
+
+The dot file source for the above diagram is uses internal kernel function
+names for the node names in order to make the corresponding logic easier to
+find. See ``Documentation/bpf/map_lru_hash_update.dot`` for more details.
