Thanks for looking into this! It's a bit unfortunate that this will need
changes in every BPF JIT. Have you thought about a generic solution which
would not require changes in JITs? Given this is for debugging and finding
mischecking/bugs in the verifier, can't we reuse interpreter for this and
only implement it there? I would be curious if we could achieve the same
result from [3] with such approach.
