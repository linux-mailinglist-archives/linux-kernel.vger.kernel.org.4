This is not the solution. As this does not allow to share one interrupt
by multiple devices / drivers, like devm_request_irq with IRQF_SHARED
flag. irq_set_chained_handler_and_data() can be used only by one device.
This was expressed more times in other threads, but seems it was
ignored.

In past I have already send patches for armada interrupt drivers and
they were rejected by Marc, who did not wanted to talk about them. And
in past already expressed that he is not interested in any more
development in Armada HW as by thinks it is broken hardware and his
devel board stopped working.

I'm really not going to implement anything new for people who already
expressed that would reject my contribution. Why would I do it?

Anyway, here we are dealing with REGRESSION in mainline kernel. Not a
new feature. Mainline kernel is currently broken and this my patch is
fixing it. Exactly same fix was already applied for other pci controller
driver.

Why it is disallowed to fix regression in kernel with exactly same
approach and same patch which was allowed for other drivers? Because it
really looks like that somebody is trying to ensure that Linux kernel
should stop working on existing hardware.

So, please if you are going to drop patch series, and you do not like my
fix for mentioned issue, could you please fix the driver to work in
mainline kernel?

Do not take me wrong, but it is really problem if mainline kernel is
broken, developers like Greg are publicly talking that vendors,
distributors and other should update kernels to new versions and not
stay on the old one; and then other developers are rejecting fixes to
regression in new versions and basically are saying that people and
vendors should not upgrade kernels to new versions as it would stop
working on some hardware.

And I'm not even mentioned that there happened lot of other development
and cleanup in this area and everything is stopped and maybe now after
2 years would discarded, like some developers want as they do not like
some kind of hardware.

I'm really disappointed that I have to discuss about such thing.


If fixing regressions and bugs is not a priority for kernel and is first
subject to rewrite other parts of code and implement couple of new
features, then I think it is a good idea to stop being doing
development.
