The reason to not wrap around the buffer was that it tends to fill up quickly
if something goes wrong. Initially I had it wrap around and often ended up
seeing endless reset sequences in the log but not the actual problem.

Yes, except that "testing" at the time included connecting an arbitrary new
device to the type c port. Pretty much each of them had its own flaws.
This was also the reason for not using tracing, because I wanted to have a
log available _all_ the time, not just when explicitly enabled.

Maybe the protocol is now more stable than it used to be, and switching
to a wraparound buffer and/or to tracing makes more sense now.
I can't really say.
