Yes, correct.  I definitely recommend posting #1 and #2 separately from the
paravirt interface, I ignored the entire series without realizing there is real
hardware support in there.

Ya, that's more or less my opinion.  Even more than allowing VMM developers to
extend/define the interface, I want the definition of the interace to be a
community/collaborative effort.  LKML has active representatives from all of the
major (known) hypervisors, so it shouldn't be *that* hard to figure out a way to
make the interface community driven.

Note that it doesn't necessarily have to be VMM developers, e.g. many of the
people that are intimately familiar with the mitigations aren't virtualization
folks.
