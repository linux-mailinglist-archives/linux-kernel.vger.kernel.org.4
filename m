The address is just a disambiguator between multiple instances so doesn't need any further emphasis, but what is crucial to the user is exactly what kind of PMU it is (especially if there's potential for other unrelated PCIe functions to start exposing their own different PMUs).

I see your point. The current prefix `pcie_bdf` is not appropriate,

- it does not indicate it is for a root point as Jonathan mentioned.
- its prefix is not `dwc`

Is dwc_rootport_100000 more appropriate?

- `dwc` indicates the PMU is for Synopsys DesignWare Cores PCIe controller IP
- `rootport` indicates the PMU is for a root port device
- `100000` indicates the device address


Thank you.

Shuai
