So per that summary, I'm going to nit-pick and state we very much want
CSE. CSE good. What we don't want it violating store-load ordering.

Oh, geez, what a twisty tale that... So Linus knew back in '09 that "p"
was icky, but it sorta was the only thing and it 'worked' -- until now
:/

Is there a way to explicitly order these things? barrier() obviously
isn't going to help here.

So ideally we'd get something that respects the whole store-load
ordering but still allows agressive CSE. And works for both toolchains.
Small ask, I know :-)
