Care to respin with my update requests? I can take up to this patch and
base it directly on v6.3-rc3 when it comes out. I'm expecting that to have
the fixes in other code that is breaking my tests.

Then I'll push it out after it passes all my tests, and you can take it
and add the arm64 specific bits on top. I'm currently running these patches
as is on my tests to see if they fail (with a patched kernel for the other
code that's breaking my tests).

Does that sound OK?
