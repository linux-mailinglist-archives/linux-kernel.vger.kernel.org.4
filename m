Those are not platform devices below a PCI device from what I can tell,
and if it is, it's wrong and should be fixed up.  Don't perpetuate bad
design decisions of the past please.

That too is wrong.

That is NOT what the platform devices and drivers are for at all, make
them some other type of device please, which is why the aux bus was
created.

I don't see how PCI is relevant here, sorry.

Ok, let's make a new bus for them then.  As obviously they are not
platform devices if they live on the PCI bus.

The same way we reuse lots of drivers for devices on different busses
today.

So you are saying that just because a bus type exports MMIO regions, it
should be allowed to be a platform device?  Sorry, but make that a new
bus type as obviously it is something else.  Maybe these are all just
real PCI devices (or sub devices), so treat them like that please.
