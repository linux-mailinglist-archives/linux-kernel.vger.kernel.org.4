Yeah I think so but I'm not entierly sure. The ordering for all queues
that don't start with max_active > 1 should not be required, here the
parallelization and out of order processing is expected and serialized
or decided once the work is done.

I think all of them somehow implictly depend on the ordering. The
replace process sequentially goes over a block group and copies blocks.

The fixup process is quite obscure and we should preserve the semantics
as much as possible. It has something to do with pages that get out of
sync with extent state without btrfs knowing and that there are more such
requests hapenning at the same time is low but once it happens it can
lead to corruptions.

Quota rescan is in its nature also a sequential process but I think it
does not need to be ordered, it's started from higher level context like
enabling quotas or rescan but there are also calls at remount time so
this makes it less clear.

In summary, if the ordered queue could be used then I'd recommend to do
it as the safe option.
