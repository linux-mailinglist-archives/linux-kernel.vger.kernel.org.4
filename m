Hmmm. Well, strictly speaking this is still a kernel regression that
should be fixed (or worked around) on the kernel level. But 5.19 is out
for a while already and this afaics was the first report of this problem
in kernel land. Maybe it's not worth it, so let's leave everything as it
is for now, if that's okay for Denis. We IMHO will need to reconsider if
more users run into this.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.

#regzbot introduced: 8ad7e8f69695
#regzbot invalid: it is a kernel regression, but one that can be worked
around by updating Xen hypervisor
