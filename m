Okay, I see now, thanks for the details!

Maybe instead of "break silently", we can return an explicit error for
SET_VRING_BASE/GET_VRING_BASE in stable branches.
But if there are not many cases, we can leave it like that.

I was just concerned about how does the user space understand that it
can use SET_VRING_BASE/GET_VRING_BASE for PACKED virtqueues in a given
kernel or not.

Thanks,
Stefano
