 No worries, owing to various distractions it took me way too long to 
iterate over this change too.

 Based on how the helper has been documented I think you are right.  Also 
I have verified your branch with my hardware and it still works.

 Thank you!  I find your rewritten change description a pleasure to read.

 I guess at this stage we'll never find out what the exact configuration 
was that has lead to commit 351fc6d1a517 ("PCI: Fix starting basis for 
resource requests").  At least it does not stand in the way.

 What a mess it was with the firmware side of the earlier PCI systems even 
once they've sorted the teething problems of the hardware side!  I still 
need to figure out how to get PCI interrupt routing to automagically work 
in the I/O APIC mode with this x86 machine and its broken MP-table which 
reports PCI interrupts as ISA interrupts, and then INTA only (at least our 
PIRQ router code now handles PCI-to-PCI bridges in the PIC mode).  And it 
would have been so easy to get it right even with a fixed table (the BIOS 
seems to build the table dynamically for no good reason even though the 
wiring is fixed in hardware)!
