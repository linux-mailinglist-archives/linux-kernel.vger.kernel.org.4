Out of curiosity - is ARM similar in this regard, interceptions and stuff?

Mmm. Nothing? If the feature is enabled and DR[0-3] are not saved in 
HOSTSA, then the host looses debug state because of the working feature.

> side effect, or an opportunistic optimization?

There is no switch. DR[67] were and are one type, and the other DRs were 
not swapped and now are, but with a different Swap Type.

And the patch saves DR[0-3] in HOSTSA but not DR[67] and this deserves 
some explaining why is that.

It is also easy to find "Swap Types" in the APM...

But it does save/load DR6 and DR7.

(english question) What does "vectoring" mean here precisely? Handling? 
Processing?

Good one, thanks for the link.

TBH I did not have a good answer but from the above I'd say we want to 
disable #DB intercepts in a separate patch, just as you say below.

Sorry for my ignorance but what is the point of injecting #DB if there 
is no way of changing the guest's DR7?

Readers of the patch may wonder of the chances of breaks guests. 
Definitely helps me to realize there is likely to be some sort of 
panic() in the guest if such intercept happens.

... I am missing the point here. You already wrote the patch below which 
1) you are happy about 2) you can push out right away to the upstream. 
Are you suggesting that I repost it?

When I see "traditional", I assume there was one single x86 KVM before 
say 2010 which was slow, emulated a lot but worked exactly the same on 
Intel and AMD. Which does not seem to ever be the case. May be say "SVM" 
here?

Like here - "common SVM"?

Thanks for the comments!
