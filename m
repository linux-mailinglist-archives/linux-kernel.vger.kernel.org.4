How would that help for private mappings shared between parent/child?
Also reducing this to a single VMA is not really necessary as
folio_check_references already does most of that work. What is really
missing is to check for other memory policies (i.e. cpusets and per-task
mempolicy). The later is what can get quite expensive.

Please note that mm can be shared even outside of the traditional thread
group so you would need to go into something like mm_update_next_owner

Yes, I do understand that from the correctness POV this is a problem. My
question is whether this is a _practical_ problem worth really being
fixed as it is not really a cheap fix. If there are strong node locality
assumptions by the userspace then I would expect demotion to be disabled
in the first place.
