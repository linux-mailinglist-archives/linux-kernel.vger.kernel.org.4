Sorry, please ignore my advice to check PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_HPS in
dpc_is_surprise_removal().

Instead, only check for pdev->is_hotplug_bridge.  The rationale being
that Surprise Down errors are par for the course on hotplug ports,
but they're an anomaly that must be reported on non-hotplug ports.

PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_HPS has no bearing on pciehp's behavior.  If there's
a hotplug port and hotplug control was granted to the OS, pciehp will
bind to the device.  pciehp will react to any DLLSC and PDC event.

I think the target audience for PCIe r6.1 sec 6.7.6 are hardware
designers and the advice given there is to add DPC capability to
hotplug ports.  That's fine.  It doesn't affect how Linux handles
async removal.

I think the wording in the spec to "use DPC" for async removal is
confusing.  We don't want to duplicate the code for device
de-/re-enumeration and slot bringup / bringdown in the dpc driver.
We just continue letting pciehp do that (and thus retain compatibility
with older, non-DPC-capable hardware).  But we wire up pciehp with
the dpc driver to add DPC-awareness for hotplug.

One part of the equation was to ignore link changes which occur
as a side effect of a DPC event from which we've successfully
recovered.  That was added with commit a97396c6eb13 ("PCI: pciehp:
Ignore Link Down/Up caused by DPC").

The other part of the equation (which you're adding here) is to
ignore Surprise Down errors in the dpc driver which occur as a side
effect of async removal.

I think that makes us compliant with PCIe r6.1 sec 6.7.6, although
we're interpreting "use DPC" (or async removal) somewhat liberally.
Actually I'd prefer the term "pragmatically" instead of "liberally". ;)

We don't want to duplicate code just for the sake of being word-by-word
compliant with the spec.  If it works in the real world, it's fine. :)

Thanks,

Lukas
