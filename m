There's a number of reasons why we did not do as you suggest.

The first reason is we want to only take the write() syscall cost when
events are wanting to be monitored. This is done at a per-trace_event
level and is not at a per-process level. user_events gives us the
ability to know cheaply when an event is or is not to be written. It
does this by setting/clearing a bit in each process when the trace_event
classes register function is invoked to attach/detach perf or ftrace.
By using a bit instead of bytes, we also have the ability to share
tracing out to the kernel as well as any local user tracer in the
future, this work was started by Mathieu Desnoyers via libside [1].

The second reason is we have found user based buffers to be unreliable
when either the user process is crashing or has a corruption bug. By
having the data buffers reside within the kernel, we prevent this from
happening. If the kernel panics, we can also pull events out of the
perf_event buffers via GDB to understand what our user processes were
doing before the time of the panic.

The third reason is we want to make use of all the features that perf,
ftrace, and eBPF have. We do not want to have to re-write all of those
features. The main things are being able to filter upon event payloads
and aggregate them together. We also selectively turn on and off stack
walking for some events (not all). Perf lets us selectively do this on a
per-event basis in addition to grabbing raw stack data to enable
unwinding via DWARF instructions. When we monitor events via
perf/ftrace, we can find each offset and type for the fields within the
event. We need to know these to properly decode events and analyze them.
Tracefs gives a us a single place to see all of these events and
efficiently decode them, including a stable event ID. We would have to
replicate all of that work in userspace in addition to the other
features we rely upon.

The fourth reason is related to the third, we have a lot of existing
diagnostics that rely upon and setup perf ring buffers. We want the user
and kernel diagnostics to land in the same buffers with the same
timestamps so we can see a full picture of what is going on.
