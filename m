Hmm, that is not at all my understanding of what has been the most
important part of the feedback so far: this whole thing belongs to
userspace.

Not really no. I've given examples of why this doesn't make sense for
the kernel to do this, which still seems to be the case with what you're
suggesting here.

I beg to differ. We need to understand where these 13% come from in more
details. Is it really the actual cost of the userspace exit? Or is it
just that from userspace the only knob you can play with is uclamp and
that didn't reach the expected level of performance?

If that is the userspace exit, then we can work to optimize that -- it's
a fairly common problem in the virt world, nothing special here.

And if the issue is the lack of expressiveness in uclamp, then that too
is something we should work on, but clearly giving vCPU threads more
'power' than normal host threads is a bit of a red flag IMO. vCPU
threads must be constrained in the same way that userspace threads are,
because they _are_ userspace threads.

I've also replied to another message about the scale invariance issue,
and I'm not convinced the frequency based interface proposed here really
makes sense. An AMU-like interface is very likely to be superior.

But it doesn't violate the whole KVM userspace delegation model, so we
should start from there and then optimize further if need be.

Thanks,
