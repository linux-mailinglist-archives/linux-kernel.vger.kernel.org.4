If you could point me where this is happening, it would be nice. So far
I could not find or see any split/merge operation.

Yes, very useful! Using that patch we would have a single place where to
issue grow/shrink ioctls. I don't think we need to inhibit ioctls, since
the operation will be atomic (this time in the true meaning, since we
don't need INVALIDATE.

With "prototype" I assume you mean the patch linked above
(region_resize), not the userspace-only proposal you sent initially right?

If we implement single operations (split/merge/grow/shrink), we don't
even need that limit. Except for merge, maybe.

Ok, if it'ok for you all I can try to use David patch and implement some
simple grow/shrink. Then we need to figure where and when exactly QEMU
performs split and merge operations, and maybe implement something
similar to what you did in your proposal?

Thank you,
Emanuele
