Yes, this is an annoying oversight of the EFI design: the config
tables are <guid, address> tuples, and the size of the table is
specific to each table type. So without knowing the GUID, there is no
way you can reserve the right size.

Perhaps you could implement something like a hypercall in
efi_arch_mem_reserve(), which is called by the EFI code to reserve
regions that are in boot services memory but need to remain reserved?
This is used for all config tables that it knows or cares about.
