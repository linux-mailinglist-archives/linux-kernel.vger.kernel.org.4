Heh, booted rc3 and managed to hit it on very first suspend to ram attempt:

tpm tpm0: A TPM error (28) occurred continue selftest

But thanks to the patch, the next suspend worked:

[  236.598900] tpm tpm0: Error (28) sending savestate before suspend
[  236.598915] tpm_tis 00:08: Ignoring error 28 while suspending

and on resume again:

[  238.196645] tpm tpm0: A TPM error (28) occurred continue selftest

and indeed now I keep getting (as expected)

[  399.671077] tpm tpm0: A TPM error (28) occurred attempting get random

So hopefully somebody will look into the root cause at some point.
