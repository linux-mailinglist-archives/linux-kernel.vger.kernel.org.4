Sounds interesting, I shall go and take a look. Just quickly, when you
say it wouldn't support the read, what exactly do you mean?
The only read that I am really interested in doing is reading the first
1K of flash as I need to RMW it, but I don't think that that's what you
mean.
Do you mean that I would not be able to dump the firmware using your
fw_upload interface? If so, that's an acceptable constraint IMO.

Your interface also circumvents us (Microchip) defining yet another
method for interacting with the FPGA, since from my nosing around,
everyone seems to do something different.

Cheers,
Conor.
