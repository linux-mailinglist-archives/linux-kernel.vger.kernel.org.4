Look forward to it.

There are three aspects of benefits if SMCA address detected by scrubber is offlined
in advance:

- Free page: it should be isolated and not allocated by buddy so that the poison data
  will never be consumed.
- In-use page: the heath VMs could be migrated into other heath node if many UCE occurs.
- Mitigate the possibility of nested MCE which is a fatal error.

Thank you.

Shuai.
