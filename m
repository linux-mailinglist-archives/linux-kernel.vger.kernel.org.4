Yes, given that the compiler will already avoid inventing data-race-prone
C-language accesses to shared variables, so if that was the only reason
that you were using READ_ONCE() or WRITE_ONCE(), then READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() won't be helping you.

Or perhaps better to put it a different way...  The fact that the compiler
is not permitted to invent data-racy reads and writes is exactly why
you do not normally need READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() for accesses in
lock-based critical sections.  Instead, you only need READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() when you have lockless accesses to the same shared variables.
