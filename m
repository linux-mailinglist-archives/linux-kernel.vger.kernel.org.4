This patch works. Thank you so much!

Ohh... I should stop comparing UNPOPULATE with buggy implementation and
compare with pre-read. I've compared apples with oranges.

I'll do better benchmark for the comparison sake. I'll let you know if the
performance is becoming an issue. Overall we need pagemap_ioctl + UFFD to
correctly emulate Windows syscall. Secondly we also need good performance
(more the better).
