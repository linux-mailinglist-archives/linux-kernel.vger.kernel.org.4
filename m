Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker. Top-posting for once,
to make this easily accessible to everyone.

I might be missing something, but it looks like this discussion stalled.
I wonder why.

Julian, did you ever share the data Bjorn asked for? Or tried a a
bisection, as suggested by Keith? Or did you stop caring for some
reason? Does everything maybe work fine these days?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
