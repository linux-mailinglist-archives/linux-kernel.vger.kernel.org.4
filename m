Michal, will you please moderate your tone? I think you can communicate
your concerns without calling my work "absolutely horrible" or a
"failure". Thanks.

Anyway, of course I intend to support the more complex calls, but
supporting the simple calls actually unbreaks a lot of stuff.

Yes, of course, thanks. Assuming user space can discover the appropriate
buffer size, which should be possible.
