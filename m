pcie_retrain_link() waits for PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_LT (Link Training) to be
cleared, which means the LTSSM has exited the Configuration/Recovery
state.  pcie_wait_for_link() waits for PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA (Data Link
Layer Link Active) to be set, which means the link is in DL_Active.

I don't see an explicit procedure in the spec for determining when
a link retrain is complete, but from PCIe r6.0, sec 6.2.11 (DPC):

  After software releases the Downstream Port from DPC, the Portâ€™s
  LTSSM must transition to the Detect state, where the Link will
  attempt to retrain. Software can use Data Link Layer State Changed
  interrupts, DL_ACTIVE ERR_COR signaling, or both, to signal when the
  Link reaches the DL_Active state again.

and sec 6.6:

  On the completion of Link Training (entering the DL_Active state,
  see Section 3.2), a component must be able to receive and process
  TLPs and DLLPs.

The only use mentioned in the spec for the Link Training bit is the
implementation note in sec 7.5.3.7 about avoiding race conditions when
using the Retrain Link bit, where software should poll Link Training
until it returns to zero before setting the Retrain Link bit to change
link parameters.

And I think you're absolutely right that what we *want* here is the
data link layer DL_Active state, not just the link layer L0 state.

This all makes me think that checking the Link Training bit might be
the wrong thing to begin with.

Of course, the Data Link Layer Link Active bit wasn't added until PCIe
r1.1, and even now it's optional.  Without it, I don't know if there's
a way to make sure the link is in DL_Active.

Maybe pcie_retrain_link() should wait for Data Link Layer Link Active
if it is supported, and use the existing behavior of waiting for Link
Training to be cleared otherwise?
