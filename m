This seems like a nice addition, but it would be nice if we could
encapsulate it in drivers/pci.

I know it's parallel to the existing include/linux/pci-ecam.h.  I wish
we could encapsulate *that* in drivers/pci, too.  For pci-ecam.h, I
think the only things that prevent that are drivers/acpi/pci_mcfg.c,
loongarch, and a few arm64 things.

pci_mcfg.c arguably would make more sense in drivers/pci; it uses
acpi_table_parse(), but no other ACPI services.

The arm64 code that uses pci-ecam.h is really generic code that would
not be in arch/arm64 except for the fact that x86 has really ugly
legacy x86-specific mmconfig code.

I guess that's a long-winded way of saying that I think maybe we could
put this in drivers/pci/pci.h even though the parallel ECAM stuff is
in include/linux/pci-ecam.h.
