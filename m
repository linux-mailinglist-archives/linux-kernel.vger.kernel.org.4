Heh, we originally proposed F_SEAL_GUEST, but that was also sub-optimal[1] ;-)

In seriousness, I do agree with Jason's very explicit objection[2] against naming
a non-KVM uAPI "guest", or any variation thereof.

An alternative that we haven't considered since the very early days is making the
uAPI a KVM ioctl() instead of a memfd() flag or dedicated syscall.  Looking at the
code for "pure shim" implementation[3], that's actually not that crazy of an idea.

I don't know that I love the idea of burying this in KVM, but there are benefits
to coupling restrictedmem to KVM (aside from getting out from behind this bikeshed
that I created).

The big benefit is that the layer of indirection goes away.  That simplifies things
like enhancing restrictedmem to allow host userspace access for debug purposes,
batching TLB flushes if a PUNCH_HOLE spans multiple memslots, enforcing exclusive
access, likely the whole "share with a device" story if/when we get there, etc.

The obvious downsides are that (a) maintenance falls under the KVM umbrella, but
that's likely to be true in practice regardless of where the code lands, and
(b) if another use case comes along, e.g. the Gunyah hypervisor[4][5], we risk
someone reinventing a similar solution.

If we can get Gunyah on board and they don't need substantial changes to the
restrictedmem implementation, then I'm all for continuing on the path we're on.
But if Gunyah wants to do their own thing, and the lightweight shim approach is
viable, then it's awfully tempting to put this all behind a KVM ioctl().
