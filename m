I'm working on cleaning this up but I'm a little confused by what
exactly needs to be under the pci_rescan_remove lock. For example the
pci_bus_add_device(virtfn) at the end of pci_iov_add_virtfn() doesn't
seem to be under the lock while most calls to pci_bus_add_devices()
are, most prominently the one in acpi_pci_root_add() which I assume is
what is used on most x86 systems. Any hints?

Also I think my original thought here might have been a premature worry
about PCI-to-PCI bridges thinking that adding the new device could lead
to more devices appearing. Of course actually thinking about it a bit
more there are quite a few other things that won't work without further
changes if we wanted to add bridges e.g. we would need to create
zpci_dev structs for these somewhere.
