I have some concerns about the patch proposed in the email that you share. =
It seems like=20
it is quite extensive (code that is it not just related to the HW) just to =
fix a hardware=20
issue. I would have expected the code to fix the bug to be integrated into =
the driver itself,=20
so that if the hardware will died at some point in the future, I would expe=
ct that also the=20
buddy code will died with it.

However, it is possible that I may have missed something in the patch,=20
and my thoughts could be wrong.

This is really unfortunate because as mentioned in some previous emails,=20
using sleep time slows down the kernel. Is there any way to tell the kernel=
=20
to tell the kernel "hey we need some more time here", or in computer scienc=
e=20
terms, load a driver asynchronously?

Thanks.

Vincent.
