Indeed, something like this (make sure the IDs actually match what your
device reports, I'm just guessing):

Marvell themselves seem to lump the 88SE92xx products together as a
closely-related family, so given that we do have quirks for 3 of the 4
already, this one does rather seem conspicuous by its absence...

Thanks,
Robin.
