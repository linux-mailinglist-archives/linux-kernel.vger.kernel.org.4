Interesting proposal to use device-links + runtime-pm for this instead
of modelling this as an i2c-mux. FWIW I'm fine with going this route instead
of using an i2c-mux approach.

I have been thinking about the i2c-mux approach a bit and the problem is
that we are not really muxing but want to turn on/off control and AFAIK
the i2c-mux framework simply leaves the mux muxed to the last used i2c-chain,
so control will never be released when the i2c transfers are done.

And if were to somehow modify things (or maybe there already is some
release callback) then the downside becomes that the i2c-mux core code
operates at the i2c transfer level. So each i2c read/write would then
enable + disavle control.

Modelling this using something like runtime pm as such is a much better
fit because then we request control once on probe / stream-on and
release it once we are fully done, rather then requesting + releasing
control once per i2c-transfer.

Regards,

Hans
