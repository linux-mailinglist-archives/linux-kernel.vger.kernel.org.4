Ideally the driver should have been designed in the way you say:
define a ring of the Linked List entries and recycle the already used
entries while the already enabled entries are being handled by the
DMA-engine (a similar approach is described in the DW PCIe/eDMA hw
manual). DW eDMA engine CSRs and LLI descriptor provide enough
functionality for that. Alas the driver implementation is more
straightforward:
1. Each DMA-engine config: SG-list, cyclic, interleaved is split up
into the "burst" entries. SG-list entries are directly mapped to the
eDMA "burst" entries. Cyclic iterations are unrolled into the
respective number of eDMA "burst" entries. A similar story with the
interleaved transactions.
2. If there is no enough entries in the Linked-List memory to fully
execute the requested DMA-transfers, then another so called DW eDMA
"chunk" is allocated.
3. DW eDMA engine executes the "chunks" one after another stopping at
the end of each one and recharging the engine with the next "chunk" until
the last one is finished.

It isn't the most effective architecture, but that's how it was
originally developed by Gustavo. Anyway discussing it is a good food
for thoughts for the driver refactoring though.)
