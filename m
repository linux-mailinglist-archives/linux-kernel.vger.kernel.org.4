Ah, no.  The key on Intel is the separate VMCS control for virtualizing xAPIC
accesses.  As you note below, KVM will provide memory semantics, which is technically
wrong.

No, I don't believe so.  I'm still hesitant to add the effetive inhibit to Intel,
though that's probably just pure paranoia at this point.  Probably makes sense to
just do it and verify that x2APIC virtualization still works.

Actually, since this is "sticky", we can go even further and just delete the
memslot.  Deleting the memslot is slightly complicated by the need to drop SRCU
if kvm_lapic_set_base() enables x2APIC during KVM_RUN, but that's enough enough
to handled by putting the disabling logic in vcpu_run() and using KVM_REQ_UNBLOCK
to ensure the memslot is deleted before the vCPU re-enters the guest.

Testing now...
