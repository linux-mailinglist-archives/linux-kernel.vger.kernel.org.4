For the benefit of everyone, the AIA spec mainly defines three
modular components:
1) Extended Local Interrupt CSRs (Smaia and Ssaia extensions)
    (ISA extension covered by: Chapter 2, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7)
2) Incoming MSI Controller (IMSIC)
    (ISA and Non-ISA extension covered by: Chapter 3 and Chapter 8)
3) Advanced PLIC (APLIC)
    (Non-ISA extension covered by: Chapter 4)

Apart from above, we have Chapter 5 ("Duo-PLIC") and Chapter 9
("IOMMU Support for MSIs to Virtual Machines") which are in draft
state.

Currently, there are no RISC-V members who have expressed
interest in implementing Chapter 5 ("Duo-PLIC") so this chapter
will stay in draft state for a foreseeable future.

The Chapter 9 ("IOMMU Support for MSIs to Virtual Machines")
defines an optional feature of IOMMU which can be implemented
by a standard IOMMU (such as RISC-V IOMMU) or a vendor specific
IOMMU. A RISC-V platform can certainly support device pass-through
using IMSIC guest files and an IOMMU which does not implement
Chapter 9. Unfortunately, there is a limit on the maximum number
of per-HART IMSIC guest files which can further limit the number
of pass-through devices. The Chapter 9 allows RISC-V platforms
to support large number of pass-through devices by defining "MRIF
- memory resident interrupt files" for an IOMMU. Further, the MRIFs
defined by Chapter 9 are simply interrupt files located in main memory
and have nothing to do with AIA local interrupt CSRs (Smaia and Ssaia).

The presence of S*aia in ISA string only implies that AIA extended
local interrupt CSRs are implemented by the underlying RISC-V
implementation.

I confirm that it is certainly not mandatory for a RISC-V platform to
implement Chapter 9 of the AIA specification if the RISC-V platform
already implements AIA and IOMMU.
