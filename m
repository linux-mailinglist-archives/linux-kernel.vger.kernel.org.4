It is usually because a) you told it to (maybe via an earlyclobber), or
b) it looked cheaper.  I don't see either here :-(

r13 is a "fixed" register, but that means it has a fixed purpose (so not
available for allocation), it does not mean "unchanging".

The GCC pattern here makes the four machine insns all stay together.
That is to make sure to not leak any secret value, which is impossible
to guarantee otherwise.

What tells GCC r13 can randomly change behind its back?  And, what then
makes GCC ignore that fact?

Any asm without output is always volatile.

Why would r13 change over the course of *this* function / this macro,
why can this not happen anywhere else?

In most cases the compiler is smart enough to use r13 directly, instead
of copying it to another reg and then using that one.  But not here for
some strange reason.  That of course is a very minor generated machine
code quality bug and nothing more :-(

The point here is to say some code clobbers r13, not the asm volatile?

At what points can r13 change?  Only when some particular functions are
called?
