Yep, that's exactly what would happen. There is no way to eliminate the
race you mention, there will always be a window of time where the page
tables no longer contain a particular translation but the TLBs may still
be holding a valid entry.

This race is benign so long as we guarantee that all translations for
the affected address (i.e. in the page tables, cached in a TLB) have
been invalidated before returning to the caller. For example, MM cannot
start swapping out guest memory until it is guaranteed that the guest is
no longer writing to it.
