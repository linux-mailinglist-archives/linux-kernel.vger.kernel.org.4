How does that justify this patch ? Your internal build depending on
something is your code. It looks like there is more to these patches
than what you are disclosing. e.g., with the dummy device series.

Please could you paint a complete picture and call out the dependencies
/ requirements for what you are trying to achieve ?

Kind regards
