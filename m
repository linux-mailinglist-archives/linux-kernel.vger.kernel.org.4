On second thought, unless you guys feel strongly, I'll just check
___init. The resulting code is going to be a lot of tricky string
manipulation / math otherwise. Not _terrible_, but I'd prefer to avoid
adding it until we have a concrete use-case. And I expect this could be
implemented much simpler using something like tags, once gcc has support
for it.
