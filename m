I'm not sure the full coverage, the test patch from Shawn Lin that
allowed the system to handle the errors has the following description:
"Native defect prevents this RC far from supporting any response from
EP which UR filed is set."

The link to the patch email is here, the full discussion is pretty
easy to follow:

There's a listing of tested cards at:
https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/ROCKPro64_Hardware_compatibility

Most cards work fine that don't require a large BAR. PCIe switches are
completely dead without the above hack patch. Cards that lie in the
middle are ones that expect BIOS / EFI support to initialize, or ones
that have complex boot roms and don't initialize quickly.
But yes, it's unfortunately going to be "if you panic, increase the
delay" unless a more complete database of cards can be generated.

Very Respectfully,
Peter Geis
