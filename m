There are two problems in terms of using kexec() to boot to a new kernel
when the old kernel has enabled TDX: 1) Part of the memory pages are
still TDX private pages (i.e. metadata used by the TDX module, and any
TDX guest memory if kexec() happens when there's any TDX guest alive).
2) There might be dirty cachelines associated with TDX private pages.

Because the hardware doesn't guarantee cache coherency among different
KeyIDs, the old kernel needs to flush cache (of those TDX private pages)
before booting to the new kernel.  Also, reading TDX private page using
any shared non-TDX KeyID with integrity-check enabled can trigger #MC.
Therefore ideally, the kernel should convert all TDX private pages back
to normal before booting to the new kernel.

However, this implementation doesn't convert TDX private pages back to
normal in kexec() because of below considerations:

1) The kernel doesn't have existing infrastructure to track which pages
   are TDX private pages.
2) The number of TDX private pages can be large, and converting all of
   them (cache flush + using MOVDIR64B to clear the page) in kexec() can
   be time consuming.
3) The new kernel will almost only use KeyID 0 to access memory.  KeyID
   0 doesn't support integrity-check, so it's OK.
4) The kernel doesn't (and may never) support MKTME.  If any 3rd party
   kernel ever supports MKTME, it should do MOVDIR64B to clear the page
   with the new MKTME KeyID (just like TDX does) before using it.

Therefore, this implementation just flushes cache to make sure there are
no stale dirty cachelines associated with any TDX private KeyIDs before
booting to the new kernel, otherwise they may silently corrupt the new
kernel.

Following SME support, use wbinvd() to flush cache in stop_this_cpu().
Theoretically, cache flush is only needed when the TDX module has been
initialized.  However initializing the TDX module is done on demand at
runtime, and it takes a mutex to read the module status.  Just check
whether TDX is enabled by BIOS instead to flush cache.

Also, the current TDX module doesn't play nicely with kexec().  The TDX
module can only be initialized once during its lifetime, and there is no
ABI to reset the module to give a new clean slate to the new kernel.
Therefore ideally, if the TDX module is ever initialized, it's better
to shut it down.  The new kernel won't be able to use TDX anyway (as it
needs to go through the TDX module initialization process which will
fail immediately at the first step).

However, shutting down the TDX module requires all CPUs being in VMX
operation, but there's no such guarantee as kexec() can happen at any
time (i.e. when KVM is not even loaded).  So just do nothing but leave
leave the TDX module open.
