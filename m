GCC's -Wmaybe-uninitialized uses interprocedural analysis I believe,
which would allow it to see that it is not possible for these variables
to be used uninitialized. However, that type of analysis can go wrong
with optimizations pretty quickly, so it was disabled for the kernel
under normal builds and W=1; W=2 will show those instances again but
again, I would not expect there to be one here.

I have no objections. Will you send the patch? Consider it
