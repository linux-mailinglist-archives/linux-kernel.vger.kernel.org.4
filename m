Yea this is a bummer. During my first attempt at this, I actually
overwrote the whole thing with zeros and then deleted it. But Ard
pointed out that this doesn't make a difference anyway. But, as it turns
out, that's more or less the same thing that happens with seed files on
SSDs (nobody calls fstrim after overwriting a seed file). So at the very
least, it's no worse?
