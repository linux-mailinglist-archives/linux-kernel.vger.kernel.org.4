But we have different PMUs for Intel hybrid. The event list is quite
different between e-core and p-core. There are some features which only
available for one type of core. I don't think we can have a single PMU
for Intel hybrid.

How about the group? Using weak group?

The current "test__events" doesn't generic enough. There is
L1-dcache-load-miss which apparently CPU specific. Also ARCH specific
events, e.g., kvm-s390, intel_pt. And groups.

How should we make it generic? Any suggestions?
