I tried both the new mid and p12. The error becomes even larger.

With new mid (start + (delta +1)/2), the error is now ~3800ns
With p12 adjustment, the error is ~6700ns.


Here is how I run the test.
$./time
$perf record -e cycles:upp --clockid monotonic_raw $some_workaround
$./time

Here are some raw data.

For the first ./time,
start: 961886196018
end: 961886215603
MONO_RAW: 341485848531

For the second ./time,
start: 986870117783
end: 986870136152
MONO_RAW: 351495432044

Here is the time generated from one PEBS record.
TSC: 968210217271
PEBS_MONO_RAW (calculated via kernel conversion information): 344019503072

Using new mid (start + (delta +1)/2), the guessed PEBS_MONO_RAW is
344019506897. The error is 3825ns.
Using p12 adjustment, the guessed PEBS_MONO_RAW is 344019509831.
The error is 6759ns
