All above make sense to me. I post my new commit message at the end of

Yes.

No, we can't. That's the reason why we need a flag here.

[ Below is an updated commit message. Hope it can describe things
   clearly.]

PCI: Add translated request only flag for pci_enable_pasid()

The PCIe fabric routes Memory Requests based on the TLP address, ignoring
the PASID. In order to ensure system integrity, commit 201007ef707a ("PCI:
Enable PASID only when ACS RR & UF enabled on upstream path") requires
some ACS features being supported on device's upstream path when enabling
PCI/PASID.

However, above change causes the Linux kernel boots to black screen on a
system with below graphic device:

00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
         [AMD/ATI] Wani [Radeon R5/R6/R7 Graphics] (rev ca)
         (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
         DeviceName: ATI EG BROADWAY
         Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device 8332

The kernel trace looks like below:

The AMD iommu driver allocates a new domain (called v2 domain) for the
amdgpu device and enables its PCI PASID/ATS/PRI before attaching the
v2 domain to it. The failure of pci_enable_pasid() due to lack of ACS
causes the domain attaching device to fail. The amdgpu device is unable
to DMA normally, resulting in a black screen of the system.

However, this device is special as it relies on ATS/PRI to resolve the
PASID + addr pair before a memory request is made into a routeable TLB
address through the translation agent. Those resolved addresses are then
cached on the device instead of in the IOMMU TLB and the device always
uses translated memory request for PASID.

ACS is not necessary for the devices that always use translated memory
request for PASID. But this is device specific and only device driver
knows this. We can't deduce this from architected config space.

Add a flag for pci_enable_pasid(), with which the device drivers could
opt-in the fact that device always uses translated memory requests for
PASID hence the ACS is not a necessity. Apply this opt-in for above AMD
graphic device.

At present, it is a common practice to enable/disable PCI PASID in the
iommu drivers. Considering that the device driver knows more about the
specific device, it's better to move pci_enable_pasid() into the specific
device drivers.
