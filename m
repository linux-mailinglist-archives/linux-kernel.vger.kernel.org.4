A DLLSC event is only ignored by pciehp if successful recovery
from DPC was possible.  In that case, the device in the slot is
still the *same*.

And you're saying in the commit message that you seek to fix the
case when "the user replaces the faulty device with a *new* one".

So for your goal, ignored DLLSC events shouldn't be relevant.

As to your question, pciehp_ist() doesn't really differentiate
between PDC and DLLSC events.  If either of them occurs,
the slot is brought down through pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change().

And that will end up in pciehp_unconfigure_device().

I think right at the end of that function, after
pci_unlock_rescan_remove() would be a good place to perform
cleanup of the hotplug port before a newly hotplugged device
can be handled.

Smita's clearing of ARI Forwarding Enable, AtomicOp Requester Enable
and 10-Bit Tag Requester Enable could be done as well at the end of
pciehp_unconfigure_device().

The crucial thing here is that the dpc driver isn't bound to the
port if DPC is handled by firmware.  Hence there's no chance of
racing with dpc_reset_link() and it's safe to clear DPC trigger
status from pciehp.

Unfortunately it's not guaranteed that dpc_reset_link() is finished
when pciehp brings down the slot.

So clearing DPC trigger status can only be done safely from the dpc
driver itself (if DPC is handled natively by the OS).

Thanks,
