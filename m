In the end it was my fault: I pushed the fix to our staging tree thinking
that there was enough time for it to be included in the PR for 6.4.
But I was wrong, the window for that closed a week earlier (which Mauro
even documented!). So Mauro never knew that this patch had to be included
in the PR to you. The right procedure would have been for me to tell Mauro
about this patch. Hopefully this will be the first and also last time that
I make that mistake.

We do have a major problem with too many incoming patches and not enough
maintainers & time. Some of it can be improved with better procedures and
testing, but that won't help the often slow code review times. It will be a
big topic during the upcoming media mini summit in Prague.

Regards,
