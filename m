By default the Kconfig option should definitely be off. We also need to 
change the Kconfig option to only be set if kernel module, JIT, kprobes 
and other dynamic text change feature are disabled at build time  (see 
discussion with Sean).

With this new Kconfig option for the static case, I think the boot 
option should be on by default because otherwise it would not really be 
possible to switch back to on later without taking the risk to silently 
breaking users' machines. However, we should rename this option to 
something like "heki_static" to be in line with the new Kconfig option.

The goal of Heki is to improve and complement kernel self-protection 
mechanisms (which don't have boot time options), and to make it 
available to everyone, see 
https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project/Recommended_Settings
In practice, it would then be kind of useless to be required to set a 
boot option to enable Heki (rather than to disable it).

X86_64 includes Intel CPUs, which can support EPT and MBEC, which are a 
requirement for Heki. ARM might have similar features but we're focused 
on x86 for now.

As a side note, I only have access to an Intel machine, which means that 
I cannot work on AMD support. However, I'll be pleased to implement such 
support if I get access to a machine with a recent AMD CPU.

One clean solution might be to parse the vmlinux.lds.S file, extract 
section and their permission, and fill that into an automatically 
generated header file.

Another way to do it would be to extract sections and associated 
permissions with objdump, but that could be an issue because of longer 
build time.

A better solution would be to extract such sections and associated 
permissions at boot time. I guess the kernel already has such helpers 
used in early boot.
