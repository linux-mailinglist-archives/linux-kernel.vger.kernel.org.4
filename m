True - I didn't bother to fix it yet because it shouldn't cause harm, but
sure this needs to be fixed.

Are you sure? The check is first because if it fails, then error is returned to userspace
and the KVM's state left unchanged.

I assume you are talking about 

        ....
	r = kvm_apic_state_fixup(vcpu, s, true);
	if (r) {
		kvm_recalculate_apic_map(vcpu->kvm);
		return r;
	}
	memcpy(vcpu->arch.apic->regs, s->regs, sizeof(*s));
        ....

That is true, and something I haven't thought about.
