Thanks a lot for following up on this!  Tell me if I have this right:

  - After a fresh boot, the Root Port at 00:14.0 [8086:5ad6] has an L1
    PM Substates Capability [per 1,2].

  - You suspend and resume the system.

  - After resume, 00:14.0 no longer has an L1 PM Substates Capability,
    as in [2].

  - The 00:14.0 Root Port leads to an iwlwifi device at 01:00.0, and
    the wifi device works fine after resume.

  - On the 01:00.0 iwlwifi device, lspci -vv still shows L1.1 and L1.2
    enabled after resume, as it did in [2].

If substates are enabled at iwlwifi but not at the Root Port, that
would not be a valid scenario per spec.  Per PCIe r6.0, sec 5.5.4:

  An L1 PM Substate enable bit must only be Set in the Upstream and
  Downstream Ports on a Link when the corresponding supported
  capability bit is Set by both the Upstream and Downstream Ports on
  that Link, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

So I don't know whether the L1.s states would still actually work.
(Is there any way to tell whether the iwlwifi power consumption
changes after the suspend/resume?  Maybe powertop?)

And ASPM configuration, e.g., disabling/enabling substates via the
sysfs "l1_1_aspm" and "l1_2_aspm" files probably won't work right.
