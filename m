Yep, this is what I'm seeing as well. I think you're right that
KF_OWNED_ARGS is just strictly unnecessary and that creating wrapper
types is the way to enable an ownership model like this.

Ok, this feels like the right approach to me. Unless I'm missing
something, modulo doing our due diligence and checking if there are any
existing kfuncs that are relying on different behavior, once this lands
I think we could maybe even make KF_TRUSTED_ARGS the default for all
kfuncs? That should probably be done in a separate patch set though.

In that case I'm fine with doing PTR_TRUSTED. Would ideally like to get
Kumar's input before doing it in v7 to avoid too much more churn.
