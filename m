You are quite correct, since what we want here is to emulate having taken =
the fault in user space =E2=80=93 which meant that NMI would have been re-e=
nabled by the never-executed return=2E

I think the "best" solution is:

regs->nmi =3D uregs->nmi;
uregs->nmi =3D 0;

=2E=2E=2E as enabling NMI is expected to have a performance penalty (being=
 the less common case, an implementation which has a performance difference=
 at all would want to optimize the non-NMI case), and I believe the compile=
r should be able to at least mostly fold those operations into ones it is d=
oing anyway=2E
