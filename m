A patch is sent for something that falls under the fs/ directory. In
this case fs/ocfs2/. The maintainer's of fs/ocfs2/ provide their acks.

A maintainer - In this case my sorry ass - of fs/ looks into the
maintainer's file to make sure that someone will pick up those patches
by looking for a tree entry under the respective fs/ocfs2/ entry.

There is no tree entry.

So the patch is picked up by a respective maintainer of fs/ to ensure
that fixes land in mainline.

So, if you have a tree that you think fs/ocfs2/ belongs to then please
send a patch to add the respective tree into the maintainer's file.

This is especially true when fs/ stuff surprisingly goes via mm/. I
don't want to have to guess what tree you're going through even if it's
been going on for a long time.

There are no bad intentions here but please clarify the ocfs2 entry in
the maintainer's file.
