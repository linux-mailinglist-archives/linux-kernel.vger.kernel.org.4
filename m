So if you want userspace to get the actual number I think we want the
host to tell us the actual number. Currently userspace only gets a
upper bound since these requests race against host changes:

0. Host updates cert_data to be 10pages
1. Guest requests SNP EXT REQ for len query
2. Host returns 10 pages
3. Host updates cert_data to be 2pages
4. Guest requests SNP EXT REQ with 10page buffer
5. Host returns certs


I have sent a V3 series. I left this patch largely the same but added
a second patch to fix up the extended request retrying.
