Hi, I'm curious while I'm trying to add the comment, before this
patchset, can bfqq be freed when bfq_weights_tree_remove is called?

bfq_completed_request
  bfqq->dispatched--
  if (!bfqq->dispatched && !bfq_bfqq_busy(bfqq))
   bfq_weights_tree_remove(bfqd, bfqq);

  // continue to use bfqq

It seems to me this is problematic if so, because bfqq is used after
bfq_weights_tree_remove() is called.

Thanks,
Kuai
