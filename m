Those were born out the DWARF unwinder itself crashing the kernel due to
it's inherent complexity (tracking the whole DWARF state machine and not
being quite robust itself).

That, and the manual CFI annotations were 'always' wrong, due to humans
and no tooling verifying them.

That said; objtool does do have a number of annotations as well; mostly
things telling what kind of stackframe stuff starts with.

Objtool 'interprets' the stackops. So it follows the call-graph and is
an interpreter for all instructions that modify the stack. Doing that it
konws what the stackframe is at 'most' places.

I think we have some details here:
