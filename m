If the above 2 points are agreeable then yes, this sounds good to me
and does address our use case.

Wei will chime in if he disagrees, but I think we _require_ that it
fails, not falls back to reclaim. The interface is asking for
demotion, and is called memory.demote. For such an interface to fall
back to reclaim would be very confusing to userspace and may trigger
reclaim on a high priority job that we want to shield from proactive
reclaim.

memory.demote will need a nodemask, for sure. Today the nodemask would
be useful if there is a specific node in the top tier that is
overloaded and we want to reduce the pressure by demoting. In the
future there will be N tiers and the nodemask says which tier to
demote from.

I don't think memory.reclaim would need a nodemask anymore? At least I
no longer see the use for it for us.

Honestly it would be great if memory.reclaim can force reclaim from a
top tier nodes. It breaks the aginig pipeline, yes, but if the user is
specifically asking for that because they decided in their usecase
it's a good idea then the kernel should comply IMO. Not a strict
requirement for us. Wei will chime in if he disagrees.

memory.demote returning -EINVAL for lasttier nodes makes sense to me.

We care deeply about specifying which node to demote _from_. That
would be some node that is approaching pressure and we're looking for
proactive saving from. So far I haven't seen any reason to control
which nodes to demote _to_. The kernel deciding that based on the
aging pipeline and the node distances sounds good to me. Obviously
someone else may find that useful.

demotion will of course not work on single tiered systems. The
interface may return some failure on such systems or not be available
at all.
