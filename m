In this case, the memory barriers are implicit apparently, with a srcu_read_lock() in the beginning of synchronize_rcu() having the implicit / indirect memory barrier. So I am not sure if that can be implemented without breaking SRCU readers.

That gets me this line of code:

	int ss_state = READ_ONCE(ssp->srcu_size_state);

Which is in srcu_torture_stats_print(), so I am guessing that something
got lost in translation.  ;-)
