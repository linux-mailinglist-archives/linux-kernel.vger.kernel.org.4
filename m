Hi Lukas,

Thanks for the review.

Sorry, it is a typo. I meant "hotplug interrupt handler".

The goal is to ensure that when a new device presence is detected, the
old DPC trigger status is cleared.

IMO, it is harmless. We just want to make sure the previous DPC trigger
status is cleared before enumerating a new device.

I initially thought to add it there. Spec also recommends clearing it
when removing the device. But I wasn't sure if pciehp_unconfigure_device()
would be called only during device removal. 

Let me test this path and get back to you.

It is the text at the end of the flowchart. Copied it here for reference.

For devices with persistent errors, a port may be kept in the DPC triggered
state (disabled) to keep those devices from continuing to generate errors. For
hot-plug slots, the errant device may be removed and replaced with a new device.
If the DPC trigger state is not cleared, then the port above the newly inserted
device will still be disabled and will be non-operational. Therefore, operating
systems may need to modify their hot-plug interrupt handling code to clear DPC
Trigger Status when a device is removed so that a subsequent insertion
will succeed.

Yes. There are code paths in the DPC driver where error recover handler
can exit before clearing the DPC trigger status. So I think this fix is
applicable for native code as well.

Currently, we only call pci_dpc_reset_trigger() in PDC interrupt handler.

Do you think there would be a race between error handler and PDC handler?
