It might have significant performance consequences.

I'd rather opt out of stock draining for isolated cpus: it might slightly reduce
the accuracy of memory limits and slightly increase the memory footprint (all
those dying memcgs...), but the impact will be limited. Actually it is limited
by the number of cpus.

Sure, my point was that in pre-oom condition several cpus might try to consolidate
the remains of the memory quota, actually working against each other. Separate issue,
which might be a reason why there are many flush attempts in the case we discuss.

Thanks!
