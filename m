Wait.  Is this as simple as just recognizing that:

  _PS0 means the OS has a knob to put the device in D0, but it doesn't
  mean the device can wake itself from a low-power state.  The OS has
  to use _S0W to learn the device's ability to wake itself.

If that's enough, maybe we don't need to complicate this with all the
Thunderbolt and device link stuff.  Which would be great, because the
code change itself has nothing to do with those things.
