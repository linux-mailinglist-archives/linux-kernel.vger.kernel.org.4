You could go further and do ... & po.

But it would still make me feel that it's a plaster used to hold 
together a steampipe.
It reminds me a bit of college when some of my class mates passed the 
nightly tests in the programming lab by doing
"if input == (the input of the specific test case they were having 
problem with) return (value expected by testcase)".
Or making everything atomic so that tsan does not complain about data 
races anymore.

If there's something in one of these relations tying together events of 
different threads, is it intentional or a bug?
I prefer to be very conscious about what is being tied together by the 
relations.

I'd rather take Boqun's suggestion to add some "debug/testing" flags to 
see if a litmus test violates a property assumed by LKMM.

Yet I think the ideal way is to have a mechanized proof that LKMM 
satisfies these properties and use that to avoid regressions.

haha : ) An alternative perspective is that the &int now covers more 
cases of the relation ; )
