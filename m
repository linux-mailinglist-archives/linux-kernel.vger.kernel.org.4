What about some other CSRs (llp, etc)? Are they all writable even if
the respective channel doesn't exist?

If it isn't possible to auto-detect a number of channels then indeed
we need to come up with a strategy to rely on the platform settings
instead. Your suggestion seems to be the best choice seeing there is a
commit 16b90dd94d3f ("dmaengine: dw-edma: Improve number of channels
check") which converts the rely-on-platform-settings pattern to the
current rely-on-min-between-plat-and-hw-capability.

Cai?
