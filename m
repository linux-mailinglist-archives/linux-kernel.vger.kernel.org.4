IIUC this is basically a multi-function device except that instead of
each device being a separate PCI Function, they all appear in a single
Function.  That would mean all the devices share the same config space
so a single PCI Command register controls all of them, they all share
the same IRQs (either INTx or MSI/MSI-X), any MMIO registers are likely
in a shared BAR, etc., right?

Obviously PCI enumeration only sees the single Function and binds a
single driver to it.  But IIUC, you want to use existing drivers for
each of these sub-devices, so this series adds a DT node for the
single Function (using the quirks that call of_pci_make_dev_node()).
And I assume that when the PCI driver claims the single Function, it
will use that DT node to add platform devices, and those existing
drivers can claim those?

I don't see the PCI driver for the single Function in this series.  Is
that coming?  Is this series useful without it?

Can you remind me why hot-adding a PCI device requires DT nodes for
parent bridges?  I don't think we have those today, so maybe the DT
node for the PCI device requires a DT parent?  How far up does that
go?  From this patch, I guess a Root Port would be the top DT node on
a PCIe system, since that's the top PCI-to-PCI bridge?

This patch adds a DT node for *every* PCI bridge in the system.  We
only actually need that node for these unusual devices.  Is there some
way the driver for the single PCI Function could add that node when it
is needed?  Sorry if you've answered this in the past; maybe the
answer could be in the commit log or a code comment in case somebody
else wonders.

It'd be nice to have a clue here about why we need this, since this is
executed for *every* system, even ACPI platforms that typically don't
use OF things.

I would use plain #ifdef here instead of IS_ENABLED(), as you did in
pci.h below.  IS_ENABLED() is true if the Kconfig symbol is set to
either "y" or "m".

Using IS_ENABLED() suggests that the config option *could* be a
module, which is not the case here because CONFIG_PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES
is a bool.

Same here, of course.

I think this connects with the secondary side comment above, right?  I
think I would comment this as:

  /*
   * PCI-PCI bridges don't translate addresses, so the child
   * (secondary side) address is identical to the parent (primary
   * side) address.
   */

and

  /*
   * Non-bridges have no child (secondary side) address, so clear it
   * out.
   */

It seems slightly confusing to use a "dynamic" property here when we
also have the OF_DYNAMIC dynamic flag above.  I think they have
different meanings, don't they?
