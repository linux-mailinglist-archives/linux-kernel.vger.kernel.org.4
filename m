05:00.0 supports the "bus" method, i.e., pci_reset_bus_function(),
which tries pci_dev_reset_slot_function() followed by
pci_parent_bus_reset().  Both of them return -ENOTTY if the device
(05:00.0) has a secondary bus ("dev->subordinate"), so I think nothing
happens here.

This was prompted by my question about whether the link comes up
correctly after an SBR.  It looks like it's not a problem when 02:03.0
and 05:00.0 are both switches because we don't use SBR in that case.

But if 05:00.0 were an endpoint instead of a switch, we *would* use
SBR, and then (I think) the link would go down, and this quirk would
not be applied.

A lot of things can change after a reset, especially if it makes a
device reload updated firmware, but we don't actually re-enumerate or
reapply quirks.  I'm looking at pci_reset_function(), where we
basically save the parts of config space we know about, do the reset,
and restore config space.

The first big chunk of the quirk (that retrains the link) only runs on
Downstream Ports, and only when PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA is clear, i.e.,
when the link is down.  What happens if this Downstream Port doesn't
have anything below it, e.g., it leads to an empty slot?  Is there
something that prevents us from attempting a retrain and waiting for
the timeout?

I was about to say the second chunk is always run even when the link
was up, but now I see that it's only for the ASMedia ASM2824.  So this
part is more like a traditional quirk that could specify that device.

If we think the first part (attempting the retrain) is safe to do
whenever the link is down, maybe we should do that more directly as
part of the PCI core instead of as a quirk?
