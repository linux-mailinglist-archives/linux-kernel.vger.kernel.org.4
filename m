Ok, may I ask why 256KB?

I see that that rules out then troublesome MMIO regions from the X1 carbon from:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2029207 :
efi: mem46: [MMIO|RUN|  ] range=[0xdfa00000-0xdfa0ffff] (0MB) [64K]
which we know we need to avoid / keep reserved.

But OTOH the reservations which are causing the problems with assigning
resources to PCI devices by Linux look like this:
efi: mem50: [MMIO        |RUN|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |  |  |  |UC] range=[0x0000000065400000-0x00000000cfffffff] (1708MB)
which is significantly larger then 256KB.

So we could e.g. also put the cut-off point at 16MB and still
remove the above troublesome reservation from the E820 table.
Note just thinking out loud here. I have no idea if 16MB
would be better...

Ack.

Could be, there is at least one hidden device called the P2SB on
most Intel systems.

It is from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1868899
which is the ideapad slim 3 with the touchpad issue caused by the:
efi: mem50: [MMIO        |RUN|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |  |  |  |UC] range=[0x0000000065400000-0x00000000cfffffff] (1708MB)
reservation getting in the way of assigning resources to
the i2c-controller.

Sorry for the confusion. What I was trying to say is that I was interested
in seeing if we could use the "RUN" flag to differentiate between:

1. The big MMIO region which we want to remove from the e820 map:
   efi: mem50: [MMIO        |RUN|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |  |  |  |UC] range=[0x0000000065400000-0x00000000cfffffff] (1708MB)

2. The small MMIO region which we want to keep to avoid the reported suspend/resume issue:
   efi: mem46: [MMIO|RUN|  ] range=[0xdfa00000-0xdfa0ffff] (0MB) [64K]

But unfortunately both have the RUN flag set so the RUN flag is
of no use to us.

Regards,

Hans
