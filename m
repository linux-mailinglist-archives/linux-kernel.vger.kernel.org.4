Yes, that's what I had in mind. WARN is fatal at EL2, so I think it's
better to fail the pgtable operation rather than bring down the entire
machine by default. Now, it _might_ be fatal anyway (e.g. if we were
handling a host stage-2 fault w/ pKVM), but the caller is in a better
position to decide the severity.

This doesn't look particularly weird to me (modulo dropping the WARN, or
moving it to _end()), but maybe I've lost my sense of taste.

It's a really minor point, so I'll leave it up to you guys.
