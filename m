It's PCIe protocol violation after all, and we can never be sure about 
the vast amount of hardware untested on loongarch after all. Miserable 
as the performance hit may get, we don't really have another choice, 
unfortunately. Someone needs to lecture the LS7A team real hard!

An option is still useful as specifying the compile-time default for 
such a kernel parameter, IMO.
