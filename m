Yes, it is.

Thanks for your explanation!

It seems almost the case, and with current way of assigning types, this
problem maybe also happend when reuse type id, am I right?

But instead of clear tracing buffers, would it be better to just mark
that record invalid if we had a way of knowing that the format had changed?
