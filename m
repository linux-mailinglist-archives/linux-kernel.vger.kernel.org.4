I would add to this list of exceptions cases where the argument is used 
as an expression within brackets, e.g.

#define m(x) myvar[x]

Because the content within the brackets is already an expression.

The other exception I would add is when a parameter is used as an 
lvalue, as:

#define m(x) do { x = 2; } while (0)

because I cannot find a case where it would cause unexpected operator 
precedence.

Are you OK with those 2 additional exceptions ?

Good point.

Indeed, brain power and reviewer time is a scarce resource. It's a shame 
to waste it on figuring out operator priority again and again.

Thanks,
