Forgive me for being skeptical, but we just spent a few months
untangling the fact that some switches send PTM request messages even
when they're in a non-D0 state.  We expected that devices in D3hot
would not send such messages because "why would they?"  But it turns
out the spec allows that, and they actually *do*.

I don't think it's robust interoperable design for a PCI controller
driver like qcom to assume anything about PCI devices unless it's
required by the spec.
