Yes, you're right. Thanks for explaining this and pointing out the
oversight.

I expect the reason it's like that is because prior to this change, as
Linus pointed out, nothing ever increments the refcount (other than as
of commit 912616f142bf: ("exit: Guarantee make_task_dead leaks the tsk
when calling do_task_exit"), which similarly increments before the
reference could have ever gone to 0, so I think is fine), so we had the
ability to save a few bytes of memory in struct task_struct. Eric
mentioned this explicitly in the commit summary for commit 3fbd7ee285b2
("tasks: Add a count of task RCU users").

Now that the refcount is actually being used as a proper refcount with
this commit, that space saving is no longer an option (unless we rip out
my changes of course). +cc Eric and Oleg -- would you guys be OK with
separating them out from that union? I guess the alternative would be to
check for p->flags & PF_EXITING in the helper, but using p->rcu_users
feels more natural.

I think this idea would work, but in order for us to do this, I believe
we'd have to add _another_ struct rcu_head to struct task_struct. If we
did that, I don't think there's any reason to not just separate them out
of the union where they live today as it's only like that for
space-saving reasons.
