So what about adding a new zone attribute that can be used to specify
the preferred caching time for the temperature?

That is, if the time interval between two consecutive updates of the
cached temperature value is less than the value of the new attribute,
the cached temperature value will be returned by "temp".  Otherwise,
it will cause the sensor to be read and the value obtained from it
will be returned to user space and cached.

If the value of the new attribute is 0, everything will work as it
does now (which will also need to be the default behavior).
