Yes, we can add that to memory.stat.

Right.

If we add the fallback events, the user can calculate it. I wouldn't
split the fail counter itself. There are too many reasons why swap can
fail, half of them implementation-defined (as in the ARM example).

So I think I'll send patches either way to:

1. Fix the hierarchical accounting of the events to make it consistent
   with other counters.

2. Add THP swap/fallback counts to memory.stat

We could consider excluding THP fallbacks from the fail count. But it
seems really wrong for the cgroup controller to start classifying
individual types of failures in the swap layer and make decisions on
how to report them to the user. Cgroups really shouldn't be in the
business of making up its own MM events. I should provide per-cgroup
accounting of native MM events. And nobody has felt the need to add
native swap failure counts yet.

So I'd argue we should either remove the swap fail count altogether
for all the reasons mentioned, or just leave it as is and as a
documented interface that is unfortunately out the door.

Thoughts?
