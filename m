Correct, its just working on an implicit understanding that the indices 
in the catalog which might still be right stick to the RM limits.

Thats why this is not bad to have.

I think kuogee just added this to keep it consistent with other checks 
present in the RM. So I didnt see any harm with that.

If he did see an issue, i will let him report that here.

Otherwise, I dont want to spend more time discussing this bounds check 
when other blocks already have it.

So, upto you guys to fight it out.
