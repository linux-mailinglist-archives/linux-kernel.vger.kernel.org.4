Well, I can understand the invalidation shall be performed for both current EP4TA,
and the nested EP4TA(EPT02) when host retries to reclaim a normal page, because L1
may assign this page to L2. But for APIC base address, will L1 map this address to
L2? 

Also, what if the virtualize APIC access is to be supported in L2, and the backing
page is being reclaimed in L0? I saw nested_get_vmcs12_pages() will check vmcs12
and set the APIC access address in VMCS02, but not sure if this routine will be
triggered by the mmu notifier...
