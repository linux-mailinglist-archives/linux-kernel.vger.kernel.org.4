It should be noted that D3cold (or whatever condition that causes the
issue) is not always entered, but only in the failure case (at least
that was the case for the Kioxia NVMe, which has a similar issue).

IIRC the primary goal of this series was to be able to turn off the
PCI clocks during suspend, to allow the SoC to enter a lower power
state. This fixing element for NVMe with the issue described above
is the the retry loop of "PCI: qcom: Add retry logic for link to be
stable in L1ss" [1].

It is currently unclear why *some* NVMe *sometimes* need a longer
time to enter the L1 sub-state. That's something Qualcomm and the
vendors of impacted NVMes should figure out.

As of now the issue has only been observed on QC SC7280, I don't
know if ECS has tried this part on other platforms. The issue could
be QC/SC7280-specific or not.

It could be used in devices that are produced by other manufacturers.

A dedicated Kconfig option for the Phison NVMe could be an option.
Or a QC specific #ifdef (ugh ...) with a comment explaining that the
issue has been only observed on QC SC7280 *so far*.
