You say 'most', which means not all of them. In anyway I have much
doubt that the "single driver per family/manufacture" rule should be
followed all the time. The fact that it works in a lot of cases
doesn't mean it gets to be general. In fact it depends on the
platform/device implementation. Even if two devices have an interface
synthesized from the same IP-core the synthesize parameters can be
very much different, the platform-setting can differ too. In that case
there is no point in having those two devices handled by the same
driver, because that would just needlessly overcomplicate the code
with a sophisticated abstraction layer (like a full HAL). So it's
better to just split the code up following the KISS principal. It will
cause having simpler individual drivers, make them more readable and
better maintainable, will simplify the parallel development process.
IMO of course.

Not only the resource, but the initialization procedures too.
Basically all DW PCIe LLDD contains: request resources,
platform-related inits, device-specific inits, and some of them even
IRQs handling. If all of that is absolutely different, then I don't
see much reason in having the combined driver even if the device is
produced by the same manufacturer.

Anyway I'd suggest to leave the driver in subject as is for now. If at
the moment of the other Baikal-* SoCs PCIe controller drivers
open-sourcing we discover that some part of this driver can be reused,
then we'll make sure this driver is converted to a more generic
version (Kconfig name, driver name, functions/data names) and submit
an update-patch with the new controller support. Currently I'd rather
have a more coherent driver in the kernel than a driver with generic
names but working with only one version of the controller.

There are in general many nasty and hard to fix bugs might be caused
due to using the relaxed-version of the accessors. Let's take the DW
PCIe driver for instance. The DW PCIe host driver performs the
DBI-access protected by the spin-lock in the methods
dw_pci_bottom_mask()/dw_pci_bottom_unmask(). In accordance with
"Documentation/memory-barriers.txt" the "relaxed" method don't
guarantee the ordering with respect to locking. It doesn't guarantee
an ordering of the parallel accesses to the same IO-address either. It
means the actual IO may be completed after the lock is released, due
to which a concurrent code may see an outdated value if it
reads/writes from/to the same IO-address in the framework of the
critical section. Such code may work most of the time until at some
point you see that some IRQ line isn't masked/unmasked even after the
corresponding mask/unmask method is executed. Moreover absolutely the
same code using the relaxed-version can work on one platform and fail
on another due to many things: IO-bus implementation,
platform-specific locks design, relaxed IO-accessors implementation,
etc (though in this context we are talking about a single platform).

In this particular case you suggest to update the method which is
utilized exactly for the DBI-accesses. Thus if we did as you say at
some random point it might work not as expected depending on the
context like described above. So on the second thought answering to
your original question, no, I can't use the "relaxed"-version here at
the very least due to the reason described above and taking into
account that the driver core methods dw_pcie_read()/dw_pcie_write()
don't use them too.

Please also note all the DW PCIe LLDD (histb, exynos, kirin) defining
the custom DBI-accessors use the strictest IO-accessors version in the
same way as the DW PCIe core driver.
