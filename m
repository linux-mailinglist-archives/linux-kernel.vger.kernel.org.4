Thanks for taking a look and the valuable suggestions. I'll coordinate
with Vasily to take this via the s390 tree. As for the locking I agree
it is out of scope for this series. Meant more that the resource
handling might be a good place to start splitting up the
pci_rescan_remove_lock and that I might take a look at that if I find
the time which of course we're all lacking.

Regards,
Niklas
