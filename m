A range in the sense of the GPUVA manager simply represents a VA space 
allocation (which in case of Nouveau is taken in userspace). Userspace 
allocates the portion of VA space and lets the kernel know about it. The 
current implementation needs that for the named reasons. So, I think 
there is no reason why this would work with one GPU, but not with 
another. It's just part of the design choice of the manager.

And I'm absolutely happy to discuss the details of the manager 
implementation though.

And those are the ones I'm looking for. Do you mind sharing the

Right, for Nouveau we have this in userspace as well.

Until here this seems to be identical to what I'm doing.

It'd be interesting to know how amdgpu handles everything that 
potentially happens between your 3) and 4). More specifically, how are 
the page tables changed when memory backed mappings are mapped on a 
sparse range? What happens when the memory backed mappings are unmapped, 
but the VKBuffer isn't de-allocated, and hence sparse mappings need to 
be re-deployed?

Let's assume the sparse VKBuffer (and hence the VA space allocation) is 
pretty large. In Nouveau the corresponding PTEs would have a rather huge 
page size to cover this. Now, if small memory backed mappings are mapped 
to this huge sparse buffer, in Nouveau we'd allocate a new PT with a 
corresponding smaller page size overlaying the sparse mappings PTEs.

How would this look like in amdgpu?

Why do you consider tracking single PTEs superior to tracking VMAs? All 
the properties for a page you mentioned above should be equal for the 
entirety of pages of a whole (memory backed) mapping, aren't they?

It was not my intention to come up with an actual allocator for the VA 
space in the sense of actually finding a free and fitting hole in the VA 
space.

For Nouveau (and XE, I think) we have this in userspace and from what 
you've written previously I thought the same applies for amdgpu?

Considering what you wrote above I assume that small structures / 
mappings in this paragraph refer to PTEs.

Immediately, I don't really see how this fine grained resolution of 
single PTEs would help implementing this in Nouveau. Actually, I think 
it would even complicate the handling of PTs, but I would need to think 
about this a bit more.
