Ok, I think I agree with you that making a separate type as we did with
struct nf_conn___init is a better solution. I'll drop this in v7. First
though, we'll have to get aligned on PTR_WALKED vs. PTR_TRUSTED.

Sounds good, assuming Kumar agrees.

Kumar should have more context here (he originally suggested this in
[0]), but AFAICT you're correct that this should be sufficient. I added
a negative test case that correctly fails if a BPF program tries to call
these helpers with a struct nf_conn* rather than a struct
nf_conn__init*.

Yes, KF_TRUSTED_ARGS really should be the default. As Kumar describes in
[1], we'll have to figure out how to avoid trace progs with unsafe args
from calling these kfuncs. Maybe the right thing to do is allow-listing
rather than deny-listing, as you pointed out.

> Separately...

That would be nice if we could do it. I assume that the issue is we're
breaking backwards compat if we do, so I'd be curious to hear what the
plan was if you're aware. The only plan that I've seen so far is what
Kumar spelled out above in [1] above.

I very much prefer the idea of allowlisting instead of denylisting,
though I wish we'd taken that approach from the start rather than going
with PTR_UNTRUSTED. It feels wrong to have both PTR_UNTRUSTED and
PTR_TRUSTED as type modifiers, as the absence of PTR_UNTRUSTED should
(and currently does) imply PTR_TRUSTED.

If we're going to go with an allowlist approach, then I think we should
just get rid of PTR_UNTRUSTED altogether. Is that what you're
suggesting? Otherwise, if we don't get rid of PTR_UNTRUSTED, then
PTR_WALKED seems like a more natural type modifier addition.

Just FYI, the main initial thread where this was all discussed was [2].
