HP BIOS Configuration driver purpose is to provide a driver supporting
the latest sysfs class firmware attributes framework allowing the user
to change BIOS settings and security solutions on HP Inc.â€™s commercial
notebooks.

Many features of HP Commercial notebooks can be managed using Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI). WMI is an implementation of Web-Based
Enterprise Management (WBEM) that provides a standards-based interface
for changing and monitoring system settings. HP BIOSCFG driver provides
a native Linux solution and the exposed features facilitates the
migration to Linux environments.

The Linux security features to be provided in hp-bioscfg driver enables
managing the BIOS settings and security solutions via sysfs, a virtual
filesystem that can be used by user-mode applications. The new
documentation cover features such Secure Platform Management and Sure
Start. Each section provides security feature description and
identifies sysfs directories and files exposed by the driver.

Many HP Commercial notebooks include a feature called Secure Platform
Management (SPM), which replaces older password-based BIOS settings
management with public key cryptography. PC secure product management
begins when a target system is provisioned with cryptographic keys
that are used to ensure the integrity of communications between system
management utilities and the BIOS.

HP Commercial notebooks have several BIOS settings that control its
behaviour and capabilities, many of which are related to security.
To prevent unauthorized changes to these settings, the system can
be configured to use a cryptographic signature-based authorization
string that the BIOS will use to verify authorization to modify the
setting.
