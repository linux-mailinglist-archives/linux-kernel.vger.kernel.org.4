OK. I will modify the change log to focus on overview of patch
implementation and be more concise.

That does make sense. Will change it.

By this way, emulator just provides the type of operation and make it to 
become
common interface open to various platforms. That also conceals vendor 
specific
implementation details. We will follow this idea.
Thanks.

I've realized it not proper to use "PFERR_xxx" which was defined for
mmu process actually. It easily makes things confuse.

We've ever thought about this scheme, i.e. doing LASS violation check before
page table walk in ->gva_to_gpa(). But we find it difficult to identify and
process the fault of Lass violation. That may need to change the 
architecture
design of mmu. Thus we recommend current implementation.

By experiment on Simics platform, I verified such kind of access will 
cause a
LASS violation. KVM has to consider lass violation check at both end of 
address
range of instruction fetch and data access in emulation. Currently it 
doesn't
take care of this corner case. Thanks to point out this potential problem.

OK. I will refine the implementation further.
