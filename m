so how would the two controllers be declared then in the DSDT used by
Windows? There's a contradiction between having a single companion
device and the ability to set the 'manager-number' to one.

You probably want to give an example of what you have, otherwise we
probably will talk past each other.

We've been handling this case of two identical amplifiers on two
different links for the last 3 years. I don't see how this could be a
problem, the codecs are declared in the scope of the companion device
and the _ADR defines in bits [51..48] which link the codec is connected to.

see example below from a TigerLake device with two identical amsp on
link 1 and 2.

   Scope (_SB.PC00.HDAS.SNDW)
    {
       Device (SWD1)
        {
            Name (_ADR, 0x000131025D131601)  // _ADR: Address

	Device (SWD2)
        {
            Name (_ADR, 0x000230025D131601)  // _ADR: Address

I still don't see how it's possible. There is an IDA used in the bus
allocation

static int sdw_get_id(struct sdw_bus *bus)
{
	int rc = ida_alloc(&sdw_bus_ida, GFP_KERNEL);

	if (rc < 0)
		return rc;

	bus->id = rc;
	return 0;
}

and that's used for debugfs

	/* create the debugfs master-N */
	snprintf(name, sizeof(name), "master-%d-%d", bus->id, bus->link_id);

as well as in sdw_master_device_add():
	dev_set_name(&md->dev, "sdw-master-%d", bus->id);

can you clarify what part of the 'SoundWire framework' is problematic? I
guess the problem is that you have identical devices with the same _ADR
under the same manager, which is problematic indeed, but that's not a
SoundWire framework issue, just not a supported configuration.

Well how about dealing with a single companion device first, cause
that's what you have now and that's already problematic.
