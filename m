Just to clarify, the intel-gw driver starts the link and waits for link
up in its host_init() callback, which is called during probe. That wait
could possibly just be dropped in favour of the one in
dw_pcie_host_init() and/or the driver could be reworked to implement
start_link().

Either way, the call in dw_pcie_host_init() will only add an additional
1 second delay in cases where the link did *not* come up.

Indeed.
