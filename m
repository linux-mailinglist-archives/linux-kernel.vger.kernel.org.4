Michal, Roman,

I understand you have far more experience in this codebase than myself, so
please help me understand what am I missing in my argument for the spinlock
approach.=C2=A0

I honestly want to improve, and your help is really appreciated.

I could read the code that calls consume_stock(), and noticed that you are
probably referencing the atomic operations on memcg->memory->usage (and oth=
ers)
used in page_counter_try_charge(). It is a single atomic variable per memcg=
 that
is potentially accessed by every cpu. Is that correct?

I understand the cost of an atomic operation such as this is high because o=
f the
inherent high cost of bouncing the variable's cacheline between those cpus.

The difference between 'usage' atomic variable and the spinlock we are prop=
osing
is the scope of the variable: spinlock is defined on a per-cpu structure,=
=C2=A0and
most of the accesses will come from the local cpu.=C2=A0

According to=C2=A0Intel=C2=AE 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer=
=E2=80=99s Manual, at
Vol. 3A page 9-5:

###
9.1.4 Effects of a LOCK Operation on Internal Processor Caches
[...]
For the P6 and more recent processor families, if the area of memory being
locked during a LOCK operation is cached in the processor that is performin=
g the
LOCK operation as write-back memory and is completely contained in a cache =
line,
the processor may not assert the LOCK# signal on the bus. Instead, it will
modify the memory location internally and allow it=E2=80=99s cache coherenc=
y mechanism
to ensure that the operation is carried out atomically. This operation is c=
alled
=E2=80=9Ccache locking.=E2=80=9D The cache coherency mechanism automaticall=
y prevents two or
more processors that have cached the same area of memory from simultaneousl=
y
modifying data in that area.
###

So locking on a percpu spinlock which is cached in the current cpu (happens=
 most
of time) is as cheap as modifying the local cacheline. Since the cachelines=
 are
already modified in the local cpu functions, so the write to memory is batc=
hed.

For reference, this is the pahole output for memcg_stock_pcp after my patch=
. The
spinlock fits in the same cacheline as the changed variables.

struct memcg_stock_pcp {
	spinlock_t                 stock_lock;           /*     0     4 */
	unsigned int               nr_pages;             /*     4     4 */
	struct mem_cgroup *        cached;               /*     8     8 */
	struct obj_cgroup *        cached_objcg;         /*    16     8 */
	struct pglist_data *       cached_pgdat;         /*    24     8 */
	unsigned int               nr_bytes;             /*    32     4 */
	int                        nr_slab_reclaimable_b; /*    36     4 */
	int                        nr_slab_unreclaimable_b; /*    40     4 */

	/* size: 48, cachelines: 1, members: 8 */
	/* padding: 4 */
	/* last cacheline: 48 bytes */
};

The only accesses that will come from a remote cpu, and thus cause the cach=
eline
to bounce and the lock to be more expensive, are the ones from
drain_all_stock(). OTOH, on upstream, those accesses already modify the rem=
ote
cacheline with an atomic variable (memcg_stock_pcp.flags), so we are only
dealing with potential contention costs.

Yes, but we are exchanging an "always schedule_work_on()", which is a kind =
of
contention, for a "sometimes we hit spinlock contention".

For the spinlock proposal, on the local cpu side, the *worst case* contenti=
on
is:
1 - wait the spin_unlock() for a complete <percpu cache drain process>,
2 - wait a cache hit for local per-cpu cacheline=C2=A0

What is current implemented (schedule_work_on() approach), for the local
cpu=C2=A0side there is *always* this contention:
1 - wait for a context switch,
2 - wait a cache hit from it's local per-cpu cacheline,
3 - wait a complete <percpu cache drain process>,=C2=A0
4 - then for a new context switch to the current thread.

So moving from schedule_work_on() to spinlocks will save 2 context switches=
 per
cpu every time drain_all_stock() is called.

On the remote cpu side, my tests point that doing the remote draining is fa=
ster
than scheduling a local draining, so it's also a gain.

Also, IIUC the possible contention in the spinlock approach happens only on
page-faulting and syscalls, versus the schedule_work_on() approach that can
interrupt user workload at any time.=C2=A0

In fact, not interrupting the user workload in isolated cpus is just a bonu=
s of
using spinlocks.

I understand the 'not scheduling work on isolated cpus' appeal: it's a much
simpler change, and will only affect cases with isolated cpus, so it is saf=
er
than changing the whole locking structure.=C2=A0

I am not against it. I already have a patch implementing it for testing, an=
d I
could gladly send it if you see fit.

But if nothing else, it introduces another specific case, and now it have t=
o
deal differently with local cpu, remote cpus, and isolated cpus.

With spinlocks, there is a much simpler solution:
- All cpus are dealt with the same way, which is faster in the local cpu (a=
s=C2=A0
  in upstream implementation).
- We don't have to avoid draining on isolated cpus.
- We get rid of the "work_struct", and scheduling costs
- We get rid of "flag", as we don't need to take care of multi-scheduling l=
ocal=C2=A0
  draining.
- When drain_all_stock() returns, all stock have already been drained, so=
=C2=A0
  retrying=C2=A0consume_stock() may have immediate results on pre-OOM cases=
.

I understand 'not scheduling work on isolated cpus' approach should work wi=
th
low impact on current behavior, and I also understand that as Maintainers y=

have to consider many more factors than a regular developer like me, and al=

that the spinlock approach is a big change on how pcp memcg caches work.=

On that topic, if there is any comparison test you find important running, =
or
any topic you think could be better discussed, please let me know.

Thank you for reviewing,
