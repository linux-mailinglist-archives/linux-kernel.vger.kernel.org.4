The above information is very useful.  This sort of detail should always
be included with a bug report, or a patch proposing to fix a bug.

The intent of that "3" is to be a time in the past.  We don't want the
-test-client- entry to be added to the cache, but we want a failure
message if the path cannot be exported.  So we set a time in the past as
the expiry time.
Using 0 is awkward as it often has special meaning, so I chose '3'.

I don't understand this. getboottime64() doesn't report time since boot.
It reports the time when the system booted.  It only changes when the
system time is deliberately changed.
At boot, it presumably reports 0.  As soon as some tool (e.g. systemd or
ntpdate) determines what the current time it and calls settimeofday() or
a similar function, the system time is changed, and the boot-time is
changed by the same amount.  Typically this will make it well over 1
billion (for anything booted this century).
So for the boot time to report as '3', something would need to set the
current time to a moment early in January 1970.  I'd be surprised if
anything is doing that.

How much tracing have you done?  Have you printed out the value of
boot.tv_sec and confirmed that it is '3' or have you only deduced it
from other evidence.
Exactly what firm evidence do you have?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
