This patchset is intended to address iterating bpf IDs and converting
IDs to FDs.  To be more specific, it covers
BPF_{PROG,MAP,LINK}_GET_NEXT_ID and BPF_{PROG,MAP,LINK}_GET_FD_BY_ID.
It should also include BPF_BTF_GET_NEXT_ID and BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID,
but I don't implement it because I find we can do more wrt BTF, for
example, if we can expose a small amount of BTFs in the vmlinux to
non-root bpf namespace.
But, yes, I should implement BTF ID in this patchset.

bpffs is a different topic and it can be implemented in later patchsets.
bpffs has its own specific problem even without the bpf namespace.
1. The user can always get the information of a bpf object through its
corresponding pinned file.
In our practice, different container users have different bpffs, and
we allow the container user to bind-mount its bpffs only, so others'
bpffs are invisible.
To make it better with the bpf namespace, I think we can fail the
operation if the pinned file doesn't belong to its bpf namespace. That
said, we will add pinned bpf files into the bpf namespace in the next
step.

2. The user can always iterate bpf objects through progs.debug and maps.deb=
ug
progs.debug and maps.debug are debugging purposes only. So I think we
can handle it later.
