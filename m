I'll make "struct kvm_vm_arch" a non pointer member, so adding
/include/<arch>/kvm_util.h files.

But I think we do not need VM_MODE_PXXV48_4K_SEV, see:

struct kvm_vm *vm_sev_create_with_one_vcpu(uint32_t policy, void *guest_code,
                                           struct kvm_vcpu **cpu)
{
        enum vm_guest_mode mode = VM_MODE_PXXV48_4K;
        uint64_t nr_pages = vm_nr_pages_required(mode, 1, 0);
        struct kvm_vm *vm;
        uint8_t measurement[512];
        int i;

        vm = ____vm_create(mode, nr_pages);

        kvm_sev_ioctl(vm, KVM_SEV_INIT, NULL);

        configure_sev_pte_masks(vm);

        *cpu = vm_vcpu_add(vm, 0, guest_code);
        kvm_vm_elf_load(vm, program_invocation_name);

        sev_vm_launch(vm, policy);

        /* Dump the initial measurement. A test to actually verify it
would be nice. */
        sev_vm_launch_measure(vm, measurement);
        pr_info("guest measurement: ");
        for (i = 0; i < 32; ++i)
                pr_info("%02x", measurement[i]);
        pr_info("\n");

        sev_vm_launch_finish(vm);

        return vm;
}
