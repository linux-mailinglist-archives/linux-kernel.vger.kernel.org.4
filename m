Yeah, this is what I meant by hand-wavily saying "0 in the verifier". I
agree that the comment is incorrect as stated, I'll fix it in the next
revision per your suggestion.

I feel like I must be missing something given that you said this was
horrendous, but I actually don't hate this. This is pretty similar to
what we do for helpers anyways, no? I certainly prefer it over the
suffix naming approach. IMO the problem with that is it kind of requires
users to dive into the verifier to understand how to implement kfuncs.
That also reminds me that in the next revision, I'll also update the
documentation for KF_TRUSTED_ARGS (and KF_OWNED_ARGS) to reflect the new
state of things.

Exactly

Great, I'll get to work on this. Unless Alexei or anyone else objects?
