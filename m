No problem! I agree. I am just somewhat confused by the "slightly more
complex" view of the situation. Currently, packets > 4K are not
supported _at all_ with AF_XDP. So this patchset adds something that
is not possible _at all_ today. We have been patiently waiting since
2018 for AF_XDP jumbo packet support. It seems that interest in this
feature from maintainers has been... lacking. :-) Now, if I understand
the situation correctly, you are asking for benchmarks to compare this
implementation with AF_XDP multi-buffer which doesn't exist yet? I am
glad it's being worked on but until there is a patchset, AF_XDP
multi-buffer is still VAPORWARE. :-)

Now in our case, we are primarily interested in throughput and
reducing total system load (so we have more compute budget for other
tasks). The faster we can receive packets the better. The packets we
need to receive are (almost) all 8000-9000 bytes... Using AF_XDP
multi-buffer would mean either (1) allocating extra space per packet
and copying the data to linearize it or (2) rewriting a significant
amount of code to handle segmented packets efficiently. If you want
benchmarks for (1) just use xdpsock and compare -z with -c. I think
that is a good approximation...

Hopefully, the HFT crowd can save this patchset in the end. :-)
