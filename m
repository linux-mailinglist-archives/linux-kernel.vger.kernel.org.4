Nice idea, I think that could actually work, since we only need the empty
2K halves on the list. So it should be possible to store the list_head
inside those.

Correct, that should not interfere.

Sounds fair, this is also one of the grossest code we have, which is also
why Alexander added the comment. I guess we could need even more comments
inside the code, as it still confuses me more than it should.

Considering that, you did remarkably well. Your patch seems to work fine,
at least it survived some LTP mm tests. I will also add it to our CI runs,
to give it some more testing. Will report tomorrow when it broke something.
See also below for some patch comments.

cmma_init_nodat() should be disjoint, not only because it is __init,
but also because it explicitly skips pagetable pages, so it should
never touch page->lru of those.

Not very familiar with the gmap code, it does look disjoint, and we should
also use complete 4K pages for pagetables instead of 2K fragments there,
but Christian or Claudio should also have a look.

It feels like it could be possible to not only avoid the double
rcu_head, but also avoid passing over the mm via page->pt_mm.
I.e. have pte_free_defer(), which has the mm, do all the checks and
list updates that page_table_free() does, for which we need the mm.
Then just skip the pgtable_pte_page_dtor() + __free_page() at the end,
and do call_rcu(pte_free_now) instead. The pte_free_now() could then
just do _dtor/__free_page similar to the generic version.

I must admit that I still have no good overview of the "big picture"
here, and especially if this approach would still fit in. Probably not,
as the to-be-freed pagetables would still be accessible, but not really
valid, if we added them back to the list, with list_heads inside them.
So maybe call_rcu() has to be done always, and not only for the case
where the whole 4K page becomes free, then we probably cannot do w/o
passing over the mm for proper list handling.

Ah, and they could also be re-used, once they are back on the list,
which will probably not go well. Is that what you meant with DD bits,
i.e. mark such fragments to prevent re-use? Smells a bit like the
"pending purge"

Yes, only empty and invalid PTEs will appear as pte_none(), i.e. entries
that contain only 0x400.

Ok, I guess that also explains why the approach mentioned above,
to avoid passing over the mm and do the list handling already in
pte_free_defer(), will not be so easy or possible at all.

Not sure if "reverse X-mas" is still part of any style guidelines,
but I still am a big fan of that :-). Although the other code in that
file is also not consistently using it ...

Bitwise XOR with 0x800 should do the trick here, i.e. give you the address
of the other 2K half, like this:

			listed = (struct list_head *)((unsigned long) table ^ 0x800UL);
