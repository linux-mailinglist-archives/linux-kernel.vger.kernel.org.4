I'm late to respond to your email again because Red Hat now imposes
gmail and its mail filtering is abysmal. I should just use
snitzer@kernel.org since it is able to ensure I am aware of
replies.. anyway, that's my problem to sort out! ;)

You're fine to approach the implementation however you and others
think best.  I have a couple core points I'll raise in the block core
patch.

But yes, I was hoping we could effectively make it so that any block
device could be augmented to remap bios (either in terms of existing
DM targets or a more minimalist approach that meets your snapshot
needs).

Feels somewhat like failure to not be able to make that advancement,
but nothing is "done" yet... let's see what we can do.

We can just move past all that. No lasting issue. I took the comments

I will have to look closer at how you're able to ensure consistency
between upper layer (FS) and the block layer.  The fsfreeze hooks were
added long ago with FS-to-block consistency (ensuring IO flushed and
halted, etc).

OK, I'll still reply to the block core patch now-ish.

No other snapshot consumers have shown themselves. Using them as some
sort of implied consensus on what is needed for generic Linux snapshot
is a bit of a leap. All you really have are your requirements. Doesn't
really help to say you represent the interests of all interested
parties if they remain nameless and in the background.
