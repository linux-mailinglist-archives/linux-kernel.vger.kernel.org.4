Sorry about that.  Unfortunately I lost my old key due to a problem
in my backups.  So I had to create a new one and asked signing
by others including Arnaldo and Jiri.  Probably it's a problem in
the pgp system as you mentioned, I don't know enough about
that though.

Sorry about the inconvenience.  I'll check this kind of
problem more seriously next time and let you know.
