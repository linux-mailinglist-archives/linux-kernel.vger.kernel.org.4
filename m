I'm very sorry, I didn't turn on encrypt or bigalloc when I tested it.

Yes, ext4_clu_mapped may return a positive value,

but when it does, reserved is false and we never need to release the space.

The previous reply was very confusing to me because the changes
in the previous reply have nothing to do with ext4_clu_mapped
and ret is always 0 when reserved is true, so we don't need
ext4_da_release_space to perform a rollback.

Indeed, there is a behavioral change in ret here.

Before modification:

ext4_da_map_blocks             --> return 0
  ext4_insert_delayed_block     --> return 0
   ext4_clu_mapped              --> return 1
   ext4_es_insert_delayed_block --> return 0

After modification:

ext4_da_map_blocks             --> return 1
  ext4_insert_delayed_block     --> return 1
   ext4_clu_mapped              --> return 1
   ext4_es_insert_delayed_block --> void

Yes, it looks very good！A million thanks for the fix!

I am very sorry for taking your time to locate and fix this issue!

I will do more checks later.
