If it's necessary to justify the commit, include the citation in the
commit log.

What tells Linux that _REG needs to be used here?  If there's nothing
that tells Linux to use _REG here, I claim it's a BIOS defect.  I'm
happy to be convinced otherwise; the way to convince me is to point to
the spec.

If it's a BIOS defect, it's fine to work around it, but we need to
understand that, own up to it, and make the exact requirements very
clear.  Otherwise we're likely to break this in the future because
future developers and maintainers will rely on the specs.

I can't suggest a call site because (1) I'm not a power management
person, and (2) I don't think we have a clear statement of when it is
required.  This must be expressed in terms of PCI power state
transitions, or at least something discoverable from a pci_dev, not
"s2idle" or even "S3" because those are meaningless in the PCI
context.
