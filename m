Whether or not the Android OEM knows what they're doing is up to them :). We
shouldn't force enabling/disabling configs based on our own opinions about who
is an expert. Phones at least have the advantage of a controlled environment
which allows them to tune their drivers based on the hardware they ship and
don't need to worry about hotplugging unexpected hardware.

Maybe I can provide some more insights on my patches that may help you guys
understand the idea behind the MSI capabilities flag. Basically, on a given
Android phone there are going to be multiple PCIe endpoints -- wifi and modem
are good examples. Some of these PCIe endpoints may only support a 32-bit MSI
capability structure, but others could support a 64-bit MSI capability
structure. So my intent was to have the PCIe RC driver detect the endpoint
device's MSI capabilites during the EP device probe and then set the
PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT accordingly before calling dw_pcie_host_init(). Since the
PCIe RC drivers are the ones to call dw_pcie_host_init(), we can dynamically
change the DMA mask and allocate the doorbell target address based on the
PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT.

This all really gets a lot more complicated with the introduction of Serge's
eDMA device. So I full well expect dw_pcie_msi_host_init() to be re-factored
for that.

Thanks for pointing this out. I agree this is a bug and I guess it hasn't
really been a problem because there isn't really any DMA'ing going on. With the
new eDMA device being introduced, this bug will likely need to be fixed.

Thanks for the responses Robin! I agree that we don't have a complete solution
and need to fix this DMA address space bug, but dont think that's enough of
a reason to drop this patch series. At the very least I think patch 1/2 which
removes the ZONE_DMA32 dependency is a worthy patch to take for 6.1.

Thanks,
Will
