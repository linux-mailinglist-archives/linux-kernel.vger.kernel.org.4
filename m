bpf is the technology used for that, but this really is about filtering
by fields in the sample type, right? So perhaps we could remove that
"bpf:" part and simply do:

  sudo ./perf record -e cycles --filter 'period > 10000' -- ./perf test -w noploop

And notice that this requires this new mechanism and just use it? It
gets more compact and should be unambiguous for non-tracepoint events?

And for tracepoint events if we can use both mechanisms, then use the
tracepoint one since it requires less setup?

Perhaps use "sample_type.field" to disambiguate if we would like to get a
field from the sample_type and another in the tracepoint if both have
the same name?

And how difficult it would be to just accept the same syntax (or a
superset) of what is available for tracepoint filters? I.e. allow || as
well as &&.

Great stuff!
