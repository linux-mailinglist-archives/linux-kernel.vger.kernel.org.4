This made me notice that we don't undo the actions (ie bridge->map_irq())
executed in pci_assign_irq() in pci_device_remove(); I don't think this
can be right and that's already a candidate for a fix.

It is not necessarily related to this thread topic, though I believe,
in an _ideal_ world, removing a bridge should guarantee that all
the downstream devices (ie drivers) had a chance of freeing/disposing
the resources they allocated. This in theory; I totally understand
Marc's point of view here and we should make up our mind about what
we want to do on host bridge removal policy - this will take me more
time to get to the bottom of it.
