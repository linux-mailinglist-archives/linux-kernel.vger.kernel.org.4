Yes it does not matter, for his tooling effort it was just to be able
to map a possible module to a symbol so tooling can display this to
disambiguate.

He just wants to be able to map if a symbol with the same name but
different addresses is due to a built-in or a module declaration of
the same symbol so it can use it.

I'm not nick but my reading of his goals is that if you peg a
"possible_module" prefix or postfix or whatever, then yes.

For 2) I think it would be good to see if one could just force Kconfig
tristate to add -DPOSSIBLE_MODULE, that would be an easier approach
than the possible-obj-m thing [0] I had suggested last
