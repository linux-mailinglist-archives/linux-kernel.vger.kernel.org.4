Sorry for jumping in this fifth version but I'm not sure about resetting 
the change is the right way (and probably, changing a trip point with 
the power allocator is not a good idea)

The platforms where the IPA is planned to be used are creating a dummy 
trip point where the IPA begins the acquisition without cooling devices 
in order to have the math building the PID schema (eg. hi3660.dtsi).

What about the sustainable power vs the trip point temperature? I mean 
we can change the trip temperature but not the sustainable power which 
is directly related to the target temperature. So the resulting power 
computation will be wrong.

The more I think about that, the more I do believe writable trip point 
and IPA are incompatible.

What about forbid that?

For instance, add a set_trip callback instead of resetting in the 
governor and return -EPERM from the IPA?

Lukasz ?

I would not say allow the maximum temperature but the new power head 
room. But that needs an update of the sustainable power information 
related to the new temperature :/

No, that would be wrong. It should be
	(tz->temperature - hysteresis) < trip.temperature

But if we are in the hysteresis area, we should allow a bit more power 
which depends on the sustainable power which was not updated with the 
trip temperature change :/

HOT and CRITICAL can not be changed because RO. The core code can use 
this assumption by not checking they are changed.

That is critical firmware information and it must not be touched by the 
user (even root). Imagine I can set 250Â°C for the critical trip point 
while the silicon supports 120Â°C only?

So basically, we should protect these trip points by making them RO.

By fixing this, only PASSIVE and ACTIVE trip points can be changed, thus 
checking CRITICAL and HOT above is pointless.

Before sending a new version, IMO we should think a bit about writable 
trip points in general because the feature does not look mature.
