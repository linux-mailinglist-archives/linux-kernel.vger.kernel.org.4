Here is the status of all RVI specs. It states that the Smaia, Ssaia
extensions are frozen (i.e. public review complete).
https://wiki.riscv.org/display/HOME/Specification+Status

I have added stephano/Jeff to confirm the same.

AFAIK, IOMMU spec is close to the public review phase and should be
frozen in this or next quarter.
IIRC, this chapter in AIA will be frozen along with IOMMU spec.

Anup: Please correct me if that's not correct.

We will most likely have an extension specific to iommu spec as well.
