I don't understand why EFI_RUNTIME_MAP should depend on KEXEC_CORE at
all: it is documented as a feature that can be enabled for debugging
as well, and kexec does not work as expected without it.

Should we just change it like this perhaps?

--- a/drivers/firmware/efi/Kconfig
+++ b/drivers/firmware/efi/Kconfig
@@ -28,8 +28,8 @@ config EFI_VARS_PSTORE_DEFAULT_DISABLE

 config EFI_RUNTIME_MAP
        bool "Export efi runtime maps to sysfs"
-       depends on X86 && EFI && KEXEC_CORE
-       default y
+       depends on X86 && EFI
+       default KEXEC_CORE
        help

and maybe add an 'if EXPERT' so that the option is only visible to
modify when CONFIG_EXPERT=y ?

In any case, I intend to move this code into arch/x86 as well, so I'll
have a couple of patches out shortly.
