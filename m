From: "Steven Rostedt (Google)" <rostedt@goodmis.org>

Over 10 years ago there were many bugs that caused function tracing to
crash because some inlined function was not inlined and should not have
been traced. This made it hard to debug because when the developer tried
to reproduce it, if their compiler still inlined the function, the bug
would not trigger. The solution back then was simply to add "notrace" to
"inline" which would make sure all functions that are marked inline are
never traced even when the compiler decides to not inline them.

A lot has changed over the last 10 years.

1) ftrace_test_recursion_trylock() is now used by all ftrace hooks which
   will prevent the recursive crashes from happening that was caused by
   inlined functions being traced.

2) noinstr is now used to mark pretty much all functions that would also
   cause problems if they are traced.

Today, it is no longer a problem if an inlined function is not inlined and
is traced. Removing notrace from inline has been requested several times
over the years. I believe it is now safe to do so.
