Actually, after studying the code better, this is
what security_dentry_create_files_as() is useful for.

 * Compute a context for a dentry as the inode is not yet available and set
 * that context in passed in creds so that new files are created using that
 * context. Context is calculated using the passed in creds and not the creds
 * of the caller.

And Smack is doing:

		if (may > 0 && (may & MAY_TRANSMUTE)) {
			ntsp->smk_task = isp->smk_inode;

The new inode will be created with the label of the current task, that
was replaced with the label of the parent directory (see above) in smac
k_dentry_create_files_as().

I think the reason why Mengchi was not obtaining the desired label when
replacing /data/dir1 was because /data is incorrectly labeled.

To ensure that /data has label 'system' and transmute is true, I added
smackfstransmute=system to the mount options.

However, at the beginning, it seemed that it didn't work:

# mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=/data,upperdir=/home/root/data,workdir=/home/root/data_work,smackfstransmute=system /data
# chsmack /data
/data access="system"

I found that the reason for this is that smack_inode_getsecurity()
retrieves metadata from the inode only for SMACK64, and the rest from
xattrs (which would not work for mount options). I just made a patch to
handle SMACK64TRANSMUTE too.

With the patch applied, I correctly get:

# mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=/data,upperdir=/home/root/data,workdir=/home/root/data_work,smackfstransmute=system /data
# chsmack /data
/data access="system" transmute="TRUE"

With the root inode correctly labeled, I get:

# mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=/data,upperdir=/home/root/data,workdir=/home/root/data_work,smackfstransmute=system /data
# rm -Rf /data/dir1
# mkdir /data/dir1
# chsmack /data/dir1
/data/dir1 access="system"

This is partially correct, transmute="TRUE" is missing.

Judging from smk_task, we cannot determine in smack_inode_init_security
() if transmuting was successful in smack_dentry_create_files_as(). We
need an extra information.

Mengchi's solution was to add the new inode as parameter
to security_dentry_create_files_as(), so that SMK_INODE_CHANGED can be
set in smk_flags, and SMACK64TRANSMUTE is set in smack_d_instantiate().

One concern could be that preallocating the inode maybe is overlayfs-
specific? A comment also says that we might not use that one:

	err = ovl_create_or_link(dentry, inode, &attr, false);
	/* Did we end up using the preallocated inode? */
	if (inode != d_inode(dentry))

We could achieve the same goal without adding a new parameter to security_dentry_create_files_as() and, instead, by adding a new field
in the task_smack structure, smk_transmuted, that is set to smk_task
when transmuting is successful.

Then, if smk_task == smk_transmuted, smack_inode_init_security() would
set SMK_INODE_CHANGED. On top of that, I would instead just provide the
second xattr SMACK64TRANSMUTE, in addition to SMACK64.

Will send the patches for upstream first, and then switch to providing 
SMACK64TRANSMUTE in smack_inode_init_security(), in a new version of
the EVM patch set.

Thanks
