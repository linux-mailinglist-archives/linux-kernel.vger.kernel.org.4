OK but should these helpers be allowed in sleepable progs? I think
not. What stops this, (using your helpers):

  cpu0                                       cpu1
  ----
  v = insert_lookup_task(task)
  kptr = bpf_kptr_xchg(&v->task, NULL);
  if (!kptr)
    return 0;
                                            map_delete_elem()
                                               put_task()
                                                 rcu_call
  do_something_might_sleep()
                                                    put_task_struct
                                                      ... free  
  kptr->[free'd memory]
 
the insert_lookup_task will bump the refcnt on the acquire on map
insert. But the lookup doesn't do anything to the refcnt and the
map_delete_elem will delete it. We have a check for spin_lock
types to stop them from being in sleepable progs. Did I miss a
similar check for these?

Thanks again
