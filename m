Doug found a practical problem with this design. The security of this
mechanism depends on the kernel being able to prevent usermode from
manipulating PCR23. While this series has managed to add that gating
to the standard /dev/tpm interface, at least on ChromeOS, there are
still many "dangerous toys" lying around that might allow a malicious
root to communicate directly with the TPM. This raw access could allow
usermode to extend PCR23 manually and forge malicious hibernate images
that appear genuine. Examples of raw access include 1) i2cget -F, 2)
unbinding the driver and binding i2c-dev instead, 3) using /dev/mem to
manipulate the i2c controller registers directly, and 4) my favorite,
remuxing the i2c pins to GPIO and bitbanging.

We did some brainstorming and came up with a pivot that has the
benefits of 1) reusing a decent chunk of this series, 2) not taking
PCR23 away from usermode (which based on other comments seemed like it
might not fly anyway), and 3) pushing the TPM interaction back down
into usermode. The new element we take advantage of is that our early
userspace is still considered trusted, as we sign the rootfs and
protect it with dm-verity.

The idea is to have early userspace ask the TPM to create a sealed key
bound to a (non-resettable) PCR. We then save the blob to disk, extend
the PCR (to prevent future unsealings in this boot), and push the key
material up to the kernel for use as a "hibernate seed". The kernel
will hold this seed in memory, and at hibernate time will use it to
encrypt a randomly generated "bulk key". The bulk key is then used to
encrypt the main hibernate image. So on disk at hibernate, we have 1)
the encrypted hibernate image, protected by the bulk key, 2) the bulk
key, protected by the seed, and finally 3) the seed, a TPM-protected
key blob that can only be unsealed when a PCR is set to its boot
value. In our own userspace implementation we'd seal this against a
firmware PCR as well, to differentiate between Verified mode and
Developer mode.

At resume time, early userspace would find the blob, successfully
unseal it (because the PCRs had reset back to the value that matches
the policy), and push the recovered seed to the kernel. It can then
push the encrypted bulk key and encrypted hibernate image. On our
systems, this works fine as the PCRs seem to always reset across
hibernate. Is that true generally as well?

So my plan for the next spin of this series looks something like:
 * Drop the tpm: and security: subsystem patches
 * Keep the gist of the PM: patches as is, but instead of the TPM stuff...
 * Introduce two new sysfs files, one to allow usermode to save the
seed into kernel memory, and another to lock out future changes to the
hibernate seed (until the next reboot).
 * Use the hibernate seed to encrypt a randomly generated bulk key,
which is then used to encrypt the main hibernate image.
 * Keep the "PM: mix user key in" patch, as we still need the image to
be encrypted with a key based on user authentication data, which this
new mechanism alone doesn't provide.

Anyone have any big objections to that plan, or see new gaping holes
in the idea? In the end I think it's actually a little nicer, as it
decouples all of the TPM-specific machinery from the concept of secure
hibernate, as well as not trying to police PCR access. Casey and Greg,
I'm going to guess you don't want to be CCed on the next spin, given
that I'm dropping the notion of taking PCR23 away from userspace.
Please holler if you would like to be CCed.
