So the VF would be directly assigned to the guest, and the guest kernel
would create a CMA instance for the VF, and do the SPDM authentication
(based on a guest provided trusted root certificate). I think one
security concern with that approach is assigning the VF to the
(potentially confidential) guest address space without the guest being
able to attest of the device trustworthiness first. That's what TDISP is
aiming at fixing (establish a secure SPDM between the confidential guest
and the device, lock the device from the guest, attest and then enable
DMA).

It's still a PCI ECN, so quite new indeed.
FWIW the rust spdm crate [1] implements the TDISP state machine.
