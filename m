The default when the RESET_ON_FORK flag is set. This field will not be used
otherwise. Like what happens for the other params.

latency_nice is coming next and most likely to require something similar. It's
not hypothetical nor over designing. I think it's worthwhile spending time to
plan for the future. More interfaces are confusing to the end users. And glibc
already complained about evolution of sched_setattr, that's why we don't have
a wrapper there yet (beside none of us pushed that hard to resolve the concerns
due to lack of bandwidth).

https://public-inbox.org/libc-alpha/87va826rsb.fsf@mid.deneb.enyo.de/

(this thread reminded me linux-api must be CCed)

And there has been various discussions of the need of higher level
wrappers/libraries that exposes simpler interface to app developers. So I'm
actually expecting this to repeat. I think that was at LPC by Len Brown. I can
find this thread on libc mailing list.

https://public-inbox.org/libc-alpha/CAMe9rOpUh1pjfEUqf_hNxce8ZX=4mg6W=n+BbdZSNFHLi7wtkw@mail.gmail.com/

These QoS hints might imply manipulating nice values and I can see ending up
with a similar situation where we need to reset nice on fork without resetting
other params.

Generally I don't think we should restrict users to self-managed model.
A delegated model does make sense, and the latter implies the need for finer
control on what to reset.

There's rtkit by the way which already an example of a delegating model to
enable creating RT tasks by non privileged users.

Should rtkit force resetting uclamp when on fork? I think it's a grey area and
I learn towards it shouldn't.

Fair enough. As I said if the maintainers are okay with current proposal, no
objection from my side. Based on my experience I didn't expect them to be. And
I do think a generic solution is not really complicated and is the better
option. You can consider this as a backup plan ;-)
