Stephan pointed out the APQ8016E TRM has details on BAM. As I understand
it, 'regular' commands are queued register read/writes for the
peripheral. Immediate commands on the other hand seem to be interpreted
by the peripheral's firmware, and don't involve any register
writes/reads from BAM's perspective.

This is what the TRM has to say:
