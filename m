Tbh I wonder why the T490s suffers from that interrupt storm at all, but that
might be a FW bug (it's not handling the interrupt). L490 definitely needs that
DMI check, right.

That's actually a Clevo N151CU. According to schematics it's wired correctly to
PIRQA#, so probably a FW bug as well.

PIRQ# wired to GPP_B0 - needs correct setup in firmware -> probably a firmware
bug.

Same device as Entroware Proteus.
