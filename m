I would argue that the current cpuset should be considered first because
chances are that it will already have the biggest memory consumption
from the constrained NUMA nodes. At least that would be the case when
cpusets are used to partition the system into exclusive NUMA domains.

Situation gets more complex with overlapping nodemasks in different
cpusets but I believe our existing semantic sucks already for those
usecases already because we just shoot a random process with an unknown
amount of memory allocated from the constrained nodemask.

This new semantic is not much worse. We could find a real oom victim
under a different cpuset but the current semantic could as well kill a
large memory consumer with a tiny footprint on the target node. With the
cpuset view the potential damage is more targeted in many cases.

Yeah, that is possible and something to consider. One way to go about
that is to make the selection from all cpusets with an overlap with the
requested nodemask (probably with a preference to more constrained
ones). In any case let's keep in mind that this is a mere heuristic. We
just need to kill some process, it is not really feasible to aim for the
best selection. We should just try to reduce the harm. Our exisiting
cpuset based OOM is effectivelly random without any clear relation to
cpusets so I would be open to experimenting in this area.
