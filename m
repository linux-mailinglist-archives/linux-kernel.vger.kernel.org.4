Non-L1SS behavior is a subset of L1SS, so if you've tested with L1SS
enabled, I would think you'd be covered.

But I'm not a hardware engineer, so maybe there's some subtlety there.
The "asking for trouble" comment from your engineer is definitely
concerning, but I have no idea what's behind that.

And obviously even if we have "brcm,enable-l1ss", the user may decide
to disable L1SS administratively, so even if the Root Port and the
device both support L1SS, it may be never be enabled.

They prefer editing the DT?

I agree the "pci=B:D.F" stuff is a bit ugly.  Do you have multiple
slots such that you would have to apply this parameter to some but not
others?  I guess I was imagining a single-slot system where you
wouldn't need to identify the specific device because there *is* only
one.
