Hi, Ted. Thanks for taking the time to look into this.

I perhaps should have been more explicit in my report. The issue is not
that the image is any different after the mount; indeed, the md5sums are
identical before and after on my machine as well. The issue is that
something is issuing writes to the backing image, which bumps the mtime
of the backing image. When handling the images with rsync, a difference
in mtime causes the whole image to need to be read.

See this flow:

$ stat image.block | grep Modify
Modify: 2023-06-22 23:00:15.211379972 -0700

# cryptsetup luksOpen image.block t2 && mount -o ro /dev/mapper/t2 /mnt/t2
# umount /mnt/t2 && cryptsetup luksClose t2

$ stat image.block | grep Modify
Modify: 2023-06-22 23:03:56.141139649 -0700


The regression is the mtime bumping behavior, which doesn't happen prior
to the eee00237 commit.

Thanks,

--Sean
