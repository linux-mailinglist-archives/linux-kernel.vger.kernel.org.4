Sorry, I'm still confused.  PCI_PASID_XLATED_REQ_ONLY is a
device-specific property, and you want to opt-in AMD graphics devices.
Where's the AMD graphics-specific change?  The current patch does
this:

  pdev_pri_ats_enable
    pci_enable_pasid(pdev, 0, PCI_PASID_XLATED_REQ_ONLY)

which looks like it does it for *all* devices below an AMD IOMMU,
without any device or driver input.

PCIe r6.0, sec 6.20.1:

  A Function is not permitted to generate Requests using Translated
  Addresses and a PASID unless both PASID Enable and Translated
  Requests with PASID Enable are Set.

You want AMD graphics devices to do DMA with translated addresses and
PASID, right?  pci_enable_pasid() sets PASID Enable
(PCI_PASID_CTRL_ENABLE), but I don't see where "Translated Requests
with PASID Enable" is set.  We don't even have a #define for it.

I would think we should check "Translated Requests with PASID
Supported" before setting "Translated Requests with PASID Enable",
too?

We need a PCIe concept-level description of the issue first, i.e., in
terms of DMA, PASID, ACS, etc.  Then we can mention the AMD GPU issue
as an instance.

The stack trace doesn't seem like it shows a failure, so I'm not sure
it's useful this time.  If it is, we can at least strip out the
irrelevant pieces.
