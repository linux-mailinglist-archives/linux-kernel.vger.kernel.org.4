This particular hardware that triggered this patch can do S3
or s2idle.

Let me confirm with internal guys whether this can reproduce
with BIOS configured to S3 as well.

I didn't think it should be limited to suspend/resume
either.

That's why I had put it in save state/restore state.

Yes; that's right.Â  _BBN is only present on \_SB_.PCI0
and the problematic device is on \_SB_.PCI0.GPP5.

Yeah.Â  When I discussed it with BIOS guys they
explained to me that the BIOS will typically save/restore the
PCIe device BAR when _REG is called (depending on the argument
to _REG).

They'll only operate on the region when it's in the right
state, and they'll restore it as necessary when OSPM would use
it again.

This is also how Windows works.
