I need to swap the whole thing in to be able to comment on this one.
I'll do this next week.

Overall the problem is that the target vCPU can inhibit its AVIC at any moment,
which forces the senders to use normal KVM_REQ_EVENT + vcpu kick to deliver
it the interrupt. It is very racy.

The only other pointer I can recall now is the code at 'svm_complete_interrupt_delivery'
