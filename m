This patchset is proposing a new kernel feature.  So by definition, there are no
existing users of it that can be broken.

The fact is, SHA-1 is cryptographically broken.  It isn't actually about how
"old" the algorithm is, or what anyone's "feelings" are.

Maybe a renaming from Secure Launch to simply Launch is in order?
