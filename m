Thanks for the thorough testing.  So the error is logged and next time
a reporting message for a different error is sent to the Root Complex,
that earlier Surprise Down Error will be seen and you'd get belated
log messages for it, is that what you're saying?

I guess I could amend the patch to let pciehp unconditionally clear
the Surprise Down Error Status bit upon a DLLSC event.

Does the patch otherwise do what you want, i.e. no irritating messages
and no extra delay incurred by AER/DPC handling?

Thanks!

Lukas
