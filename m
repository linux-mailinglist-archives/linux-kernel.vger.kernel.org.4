The patch description leaves out the most important piece of information.

The device located at the PCI endpoint is implemented via FPGA
   - which is programmed after Linux boots (or somewhere late in the boot process)
      - (A) and thus can not be described by static data available pre-boot because
            it is dynamic (and the FPGA program will often change while the Linux
            kernel is already booted
      - (B) can be described by static data available pre-boot because the FPGA
            program will always be the same for this device on this system

I am not positive what part of what I wrote above is correct and would appreciate
some confirmation of what is correct or incorrect.
