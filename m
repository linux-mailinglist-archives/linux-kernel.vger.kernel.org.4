Your opinion is more reasonable. I will omit this sentence.

Before this patch, I sent the patch named :
PCI: vmd: Do not disable MSI-X remapping in VMD 28C0 controller
(patchwork link:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/patch/20221222072603.1175248=
-1-korantwork@gmail.com/)
We found the 4k rand read's iops could drop 50% if 4 NVMEs were
mounted in one PCIE port with VMD MSI bypass.
I suppose this is because the VMD Controller can aggregate interrupts.
But those test result is so long that I didn't add them to this patch
commit log.
If you believe it is necessary, I will try to add some simple instructions

I used to just want to disable 28C0's VMD MSI bypass by default.
But Nirmal suggested the current method by adjusting the param.
Because he and other reviewers worry there are some other scenarios we
didn't consider.
Adding a method to adjust VMD'S MSI-X mode is better.

If I am wrong, please feel free to correct me at any time.
I place the "vmd_config_msi_remap_param" that is VMD MSI-X's mode
param configuring helper front
"vmd_enable_domain". So, It will not change the logic disabling
remapping from ee81ee84f873, such as
"Currently MSI remapping must be enabled in guest passthrough mode".
So, if the user config the wrong type, it will not work, and they can
find it by dmesg.
And that's why I add the MSI-X mode init print.

That's nicer.

All right, I will change it to "!strcmp()" way.

Thanks for you review~
