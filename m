HammerDB is a TPC-C and TPC-H benchmark but details of the IO depend more
on the database it is hammering. Do you know which one? Anyway the most
important fact for me is that it is visible in a real world workload (well,
as much as DB benchmarking is real-world ;)).

I see. Thanks for experiments.

Yes, so these patches have kind of magnifying effect together as each
multiplies the number of scanning by 2. So with both of them we get like 4
scans of the inode for dirty pages in one writeback round instead of 1.

Yes, I expect there will be latency impact but for this workload probably
relatively small. I expect the expensive part on your workload is the
fsync(2) call, in particular the committing of the transaction and the
flushing of the disk caches as a result of that. Data writes themselves are
relatively cheap. If you had say 1MB blocks instead of 16k ones, I'd expect
the numbers to start looking differently as the cost of IO and of cache
flushing becomes for comparable - obviously it all depends on the details
of the backing storage as well. Perhaps could you measure how much time we
spend in file_write_and_wait_range() calls vs in the whole ext4_sync_file()
call to confirm that?

Overall your tests show we could gain some throughput without sacrificing
too much latency if we somehow batch tiny fsync requests more. The trick is
how to do this without regressing other workloads and also across various
storage types which are going to have very different properties.
