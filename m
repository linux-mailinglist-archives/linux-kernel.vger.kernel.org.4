No. It is using the IOMMU for all address translation. I am also
pushing back on the test being used as well. It is always possible
they have implemented something incorrectly and are overrunning a
buffer going into the reserved IOVA region and the overlap is just a
coincidence.

We were setting the Redirect Request only, no Egress. I agree, based
on the config everything should just go upstream. However if we
eliminate the switch or put things in passthrough mode the problem
goes away.

The hole has to do mostly with avoiding any possibility of misrouting
things, or at least that was my understanding after reading it.

I'm working with the team having the issue to try and verify that now.
In theory it should already be reserved so I am working with them to
check that.
