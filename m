This isn't really converging on a solution.  At this point, I just see
my verbatim text being copied and pasted into these functions without
really anything additional.

This comment, for instance, just blathers about what could be done but
doesn't actually explain what it is doing here.

But, again, this isn't converging.  It's just thrashing and not getting
any better.  I guess I'll just fix it up best I can when I apply it.
