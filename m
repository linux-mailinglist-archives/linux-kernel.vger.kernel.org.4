I haven't dug too much into the actual code yet, but I have some high
level feedback based on a quick look through the series:

 - Use the format "KVM: selftests: <Decsription>" for the shortlog.

 - Make the shortlog more specific. "vcpu related code consolidation" is
   vague.

 - Do not introduce bugs and then fix them in subsequent commits.  This
   breaks bisection. For example, kvm_page_table_test is broken at "KVM:
   selftests/kvm_util: use vm->vcpus[] when create vm with vcpus" and
   then fixed by "KVM: selftests/kvm_page_table_test: vcpu related code
   consolidation".

 - Try to limit each patch to one logical change. This is somewhat more
   art than science, but the basic idea is to avoid changing too much at
   once so that the code is easier to review and bisect. For example,
   "KVM: selftests/perf_test_util: vcpu related code consolidation" has
   a list of 6 different changes being made in the commit description.
   This is a sure sign this commit should be broken up. The same applies
   to many of the other patches. This will also make it easier to come
   up with more specific shortlogs.
