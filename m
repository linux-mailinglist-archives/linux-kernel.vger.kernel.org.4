It will want to look like something along those lines - I'm not 100% sure we'll ever care
about the put, but we may do if there are resource to refcount - or we need to maintain
per DOE access controls (maybe only one user of a given protocol at a time for example).
Whether to have a driver call an init, or do it on first access as you suggest is an
open question - for example we may want to expose debug info on support protocols even
though none are currently in use.  There is also a dance around interrupts (once those
are supported for DOEs in general).  Until the PCI driver has requested interrupts
we can't use them for DOE, but we may want to poll it before that stage then switch
over.

There are added complexities in that the outcome of the SPDM discussion at plumbers was
that we probably want to run some DOE stuff before probing a driver at all - to allow
userspace to block driver probe if the attestation fails.  Not yet sure exactly what
that will look like yet.
