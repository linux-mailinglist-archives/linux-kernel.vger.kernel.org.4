That's what clang's _Nonnull attribute does (with -Wnullability-extension).
https://godbolt.org/z/6jo1zbMd9
But it's not toolchain portable, at the moment.  Would require changes
to clang to use the GNU C __attribute__ syntax, too (which I'm not
against adding support for).

Heh, I just had this conversation maybe within the past month with
Bionic (Android's libc) developers.

Yeah, the nonnull attributes !=3D _Nonnull "attributes." (Quotes because
IIUC _Nonnull doesn't use the __attribute__ GNU C extension syntax).
My understanding (which may be wrong) is that nonnull is implemented
for compatibility with GCC, while _Nonnull was likely implemented by
Apple (my guess; did not check) (so compatibility with GNU C
__attribute__ syntax probably wasn't considered in code review).

https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#nullability-attributes

The Bionic developers are deploying _Nonnull throughout the codebase
and intentionally not using nonnull which is dangerous (a teammate
used the term "Developer Hostile Behavior"). nonnull has implications
on codegen, _Nonnull only affects diagnostics.

https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:zijunzhao@google.com+Nullab=
ility

For examples. Works on return types, too.  So _Nonnull can be used on
return types rather than returns_nonnull.

Thanks! :-*

Good. I can feel your anger. Strike me down with all of your hatred,
and your journey to the dark side will be complete.  Your hate has
made you powerful.  Let the hate flow through you!
