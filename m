Both patches LGTM.

The spec reference for this change is PCIe r6.0.1 sec 7.5.3.2:

The Slot Implemented bit in the PCI Express Capabilities register
is only valid for Downstream Ports and undefined on Upstream Ports.

The Slot Capabilities / Control / Status registers are only operable
if the Slot Implemented bit is valid and set.  PCIe hotplug depends
on those registers.

(pcie_capability_reg_implemented() in drivers/pci/access.c returns false
for the Slot Capabilities / Control / Status registers unless the port
is a Root or Downstream Port.  Reads of those registers thus always
return 0.)

(Root Ports are Downstream Ports per the definition of "Downstream"
on page 94 of the PCIe r6.0.1 Base Spec.)

Thanks,

Lukas
