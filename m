I think having a return value be conditionally _Nonnull is "garbage
in; garbage out."  The straightforward case would be to have `bar` be
conditionally _Nonnull on the same preprocessor condition.

void *
#ifndef CONFIG_XYZ
_Nonnull
#endif
bar (void) {
#ifdef CONFIG_XYZ
  if (somecondition) return NULL;
#endif
  return foo(); }

Then code reviewers could go: "yikes; please make bar unconditionally
_Nonnull, or simply don't use _Nonnull here."

Of course, it was a quick hack.

Thinking more about this, I really think _Nonnull should behave like a
qualifier (const, restrict, volatile). So the above example would be:

void * _Nonnull ptr =3D foo();
if (!ptr) // warning: tautology

That would require changes to the variables that calls to functions
that return ERR_PTR's were stored in.  That simplifies the semantic
analysis, since the compiler can simply look at the declaration of
`ptr` and not try to see that `ptr`'s value at some point in the
control flow graph was something returned from calling a _Nonnull
returning function.

Because _Nonnull isn't modeled as a qualifier in clang today, this doesn't =
warn:
```
void foo(void* _Nonnull);
void *bar(void);

void baz (void) {
  void *x =3D bar();
  foo(x);
}
```
It would be nice to say that "baz calls foo which expects its
parameter to be _Nonnull, but you passed a pointer that could be
null".  I also wonder if casting works...

Rust got this right; pretty sure they have NonNull and NonZero types.

The bones are there; we could finish the damned thing if it sounds
like something that would be useful/usable in the kernel?  I guess the
impetus is that ERR_PTR checks should be comparing against < 0 rather
than =3D=3D NULL, since that's a tautology?
