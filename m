As far as I can see the commit
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20201117165312.25847-1-vidyas@nvidia.com/
isn't marked as fixes or whatever. If so it gets to be pointless due to this
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/of/platform.c#L183
and this
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/base/platform.c#L529
and seeing none of the DW PCIe RP/EP platform drivers change the
device DMA-mask of the being probed platform device. So the mask must
have been of 32-bits anyway even without that commit.

Moreover as Rob already told you here
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAL_JsqJh=d-B51b6yPBRq0tOwbChN=AFPr-a19U1QdQZAE7c1A@mail.gmail.com/
and I mentioned in my response here
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220912000211.ct6asuhhmnatje5e@mobilestation/
DW PCie MSI TLPs never reach the system memory. The TLP PCIe-bus target
address is checked in the host bridge. If it matches to the one
initialized in the iMSI-RX engine CSRs the MSI IRQ will be raised.
None system memory IO will be actually performed. Thus changing the
device DMA-capability due to something which actually doesn't cause
any DMA at the very least inappropriate.

The last but not least changing the DMA-mask in the common code which
isn't aware of the device/platform capability is also at the very least
inappropriate.

Regarding your changes. I'll give you my comments in that thread, but
here is a short summary. One more time. There is no actually DMA
performed on MSI due to the way the iMSI-RX works. So setting the
device DMA-mask based on that is inappropriate. Secondly the coherent
memory might be very expensive on some platforms
(see Documentation/core-api/dma-api.rst). And it's on MIPS32 for
instance. Thus using dma_alloc_coherent()
for something other than for real DMA is also inappropriate. What
should have been done instead:
1. Drop any dma_set_mask*() invocations.
1. Preserve the alloc_page() method usage.
2. Pass GFP_DMA32 to the alloc_page() function only if
PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT is set.

The suggestion above is the best choice seeing we can't reserve some
part of the PCI-bus memory without allocating the real system memory
behind as @Robin noted here in the last paragraph:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/1e63a581-14ae-b4b5-a5bf-ca8f09c33af6@arm.com/
