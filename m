Wait, WHAT?

That's a MAJOR bug with the use case of tracepoints!

The scheduler should have. On entering the ring buffer code
ring_buffer_lock_reserver() it disables preemption and does not
re-enable it until ring_buffer_unlock_commit().

The only way to migrate is if you re-enable preemption. WHICH IS A BUG!

> - ftrace users will be responsible to avoid migration during TP assign (RDMA in my case)

Yes, it is responsible to do that. Just like it's up to users of
spin_locks to not enable preemption and migrate while holding one.
Entering the ring buffer code is the same as holding a spin_lock except
that the ring buffer code allows for reentrancy.

I think that whatever enabled preemption in the ib_mad trace event
needs to be fixed.
