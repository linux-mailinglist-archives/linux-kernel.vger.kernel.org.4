No, not much predictable because the kernel code can be changed.

Right, but it might change something before checking the input, and
if it rejects the sane input, the caller may go into unexpected
status (e.g. the caller already checked input value, and does not
expect the call is fail). Such behaviors are buggy, yes. And the
FEI is designed for finding such buggy behavior.
(e.g. injecting error, but the caller passed successfully, it
means the caller code has some issue.)

Yes, but that doesn't cover all cases. If the function doesn't have
any internal state but returns an error according to the input,
FEI can make it return an error even if the input is correct.
And if it cause a kernel panic, that is a panic that must not
happen without FEI.

Thus, the ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION should only be applied to the
function which has so-called 'side-effect', e.g. memory allocation,
external data (except for input data) read, etc. that could cause
an error regardless of the input value. Then the caller must
handle such errors.

> At this point crash dump might be necessary to debug.

Yes. So the TAINT flag can help. Please consider that the TAINT flag
doesn't mean you are guilty, but this is just a hint for debugging.
(good for the first triage)

I don't blame the bpf, but just it points that undesigned behavior has
been injected. So we have to take it into account.
