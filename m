I believe its the MySQL database though not so sure.

Yeah i agree fsync is much more expensive operation than just dirtying 
buffers in page cache.
I did use the ext4dist tool from bcc to get the distribution of write vs 
fsync.
Overall fsync is much more expensive operation so yeah if we can get 
higher throughput here with batching
it shouldn't impact fsync latency that much.
