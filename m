Which will do
rcu_read_lock()
and then call user_event_enabler_write() under lock...

... which will call pin_user_pages_remote() in RCU CS.
This looks buggy, since pin_user_pages_remote() may schedule.

This part looks questionable.

The only users of fixup_user_fault() were futex and KVM.
Now user_events are calling it too from user_event_mm_fault_in() where
"bool unlocked;" is uninitialized and state of this flag is not checked
after fixup_user_fault() call.
Not an MM expert, but this is suspicious.

Furthermore.
Here the kernel writes bits in user pages.
It's missing user_access_begin/end.
Early on there was an access_ok() check during user_event registration,
but it's not enough.
I believe user_access_begin() has to be done before the actual access,
since it does __uaccess_begin_nospec().

Another issue is that the user space could have supplied any address as
enabler->addr including addr in a huge page or a file backed mmaped address.
I don't know whether above code can handle it.

I'm not a GUP expert either, but direct use of pin_user_pages_remote() looks
suspicious too.
I think ptrace_may_access() is missing.
I guess it has to be a root user to do 
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/user_events/test/enable

to trigger the kernel writes into various MM of user processes, but still.
There are security/LSM checks in many paths that accesses user memory.
These checks are bypassed here.

and not just 'volatile' is missing, but this is buggy in general.
The kernel only wrote one bit into 'enabled' variable.
The user space should be checking that one bit only.
Since samples/user_events/example.c registering with reg.enable_bit = 31;
it probably should be
  if (READ_ONCE(enabled) & (1u << 31))

Another misleading example. The writev() could have failed,
but the message will say "success".
And it's easy to make mistake here.
The iovec[0] should be write_index that was received by user space
after registration via ioctl.

If my understanding of user_events design is correct, various user
process (all running as root) will open /sys/kernel/tracing/user_events_data
then will do multiple ioctl(fd, DIAG_IOCSREG) for various events and
remember write_index-es and enabled's addresses.
Then in various places in the code they will do
if (READ_ONCE(enabled_X) & (1u << correct_bit)) {
    io[0].iov_base = &write_index_X;
    io[1].iov_base = data_to_send_to_kernel;

and write_index has to match with the format of data.
During the writev() the kernel will validate user_event_validate(),
but this is expensive.
The design of user events looks fragile to me. One user process can write
into user_event of another process by supplying wrong 'write_index' and the
kernel won't catch it if data formats are compatible.

All such processes have to be root to access /sys/kernel/tracing/user_events_data,
so not a security issue, but use cases for user_events seems to be very limited.
During LSFMMBPF, Steven, you've mentioned that you want to use user_event in chrome.
I think you didn't imply that chrome browser will be running as root.
You probably meant something else.

Now as far as this particular patch.

s/perf_trace_buf_submit/perf_trace_run_bpf_submit/

may look trivial, but there is a lot to unpack here.

How bpf prog was attached to user event?
What is the life time of bpf prog?
What happens when user process crashes?
What happens when user event is unregistered ?
What is bpf prog context? Like, what helpers are allowed to be called?
Does libbpf need updating?
etc etc

No selftests were provided with this patch, so impossible to answer.

In general we don't want bpf to be called in various parts of the kernel
just because bpf was used in similar parts elsewhere.
bpf needs to provide real value for a particular kernel subsystem.

For user events it's still not clear to me what bpf can bring to the table.

The commit log of this proposed patch says:
"When BPF programs are attached to tracepoints created by user_events
the BPF programs do not get run even though the attach succeeds."

It looks to me that it's a bug in attaching.
The kernel shouldn't have allowed attaching bpf prog to user events,
since they cannot be run.

Then the commit log says:
"This keeps user_events consistent
with how other kernel, modules, and probes expose tracepoint data to allow
attachment of a BPF program."

"keep consistent" is not a reason to use bpf with user_events.

Beau,
please provide a detailed explanation of your use case and how bpf helps.

Also please explain why uprobe/USDT and bpf don't achieve your goals.
Various user space applications have USDTs in them.
This is an existing mechanism that was proven to be useful to many projects
including glibc, python, mysql.

Comparing to user_events the USDTs work fine in unprivileged applications
and have zero overhead when not turned on. USDT is a single 'nop' instruction
while user events need if(enabled & bit) check plus iov prep and write.

When enabled the write() is probably faster than USDT trap, but all the extra
overhead in tracepoint and user_event_validate() probably makes it the same speed.
So why not USDT ?
