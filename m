How old's the kernel? Before 5.11, intel-iommu wasn't hooked up to 
iommu-dma so didn't do quite the same thing - it only reserved whatever 
specific PCI memory resources existed at boot, rather than the whole 
window as iommu-dma does. Either way, ftrace on reserve_iova() (or just 
whack a print in there) should suffice to see what's happened.
