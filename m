Doing two things makes this a candidate for splitting into two
patches, as you've already done for the driver support.  They seem

Is this related to the existing generic "supports-clkreq" property?  I
guess not, because supports-clkreq looks like a description of CLKREQ
signal routing, while brcm,enable-l1ss looks like a description of
what kind of downstream device is present?

What bad things would happen if the driver always configured (c)?

Other platforms don't require this, and having to edit the DT based on
what PCIe device is plugged in seems wrong.  If brcmstb does need it,
that suggests a hardware defect.  If we need this to work around a
defect, that's OK, but we should acknowledge the defect so we can stop
using this for future hardware that doesn't need it.

Maybe the name should be more specific to CLKREQ#, since this doesn't
actually *enable* L1SS; apparently it's just one of the pieces needed
to enable L1SS?

I asked before whether this should be made generic and not
brcm-specific, since completion timeouts are generic PCIe things.  I
didn't see any discussion, but Rob reviewed this so I guess it's OK
as-is.

Is there something unique about brcm that requires this?  I think it's
common for PCIe Completion Timeouts to cause CPU aborts.

Surely other drivers need to configure the completion timeout, but
pcie-rcar-host.c and pcie-rcar-ep.c are the only ones I could find.
Maybe the brcmstb power-up values are just too small?  Does the
correct value need to be in DT, or could it just be built into the
driver?

This sounds like something dependent on the downstream device
connected, which again sounds hard for users to deal with.  How would
they know what to use here?
