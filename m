How about adding support for checkpatch extension plugins? If we could add
a plugin script, e.g. tools/testing/selftests/kvm/.checkpatch, and modify
checkpatch to run .checkpatch scripts in the patched files' directories
(and recursively in the parent directories) when found, then we'd get
custom checkpatch behaviors. The scripts wouldn't even have to be written
in Perl (but I say that a bit sadly, because I like Perl).

Thanks,
