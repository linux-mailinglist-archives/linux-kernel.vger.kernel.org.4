I don't understand this; can you say it another way?  "Ownership of
the AER related register" and "ownership of the AER capability" sound
exactly the same to me.

Why was the HEST mechanism added if the functionality is equivalent
to the existing _HPP/_HPX?  There must be something that HEST supplies
that _HPP/_HPX did not.

I think we need some things in the commit log (and short comments in
the code) to help maintain this in the future:

  - What problem does this solve, e.g., is there some bug that happens
    because we lack this functionality?

  - How is this HEST mechanism related to _HPP/_HPX?  What are the
    differences?

  - How is this related to _OSC AER ownership?

I think we ignore _OSC ownership in the existing _HPP/_HPX code, but
that seems like a potential problem.  The PCI Firmware spec (r3.3, sec
4.5.1) is pretty clear:

  If control of this feature was requested and denied or was not
  requested, firmware returns this bit set to 0, and the operating
  system must not modify the Advanced Error Reporting Capability or
  the other error enable/status bits listed above.
