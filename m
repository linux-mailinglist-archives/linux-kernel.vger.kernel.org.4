Could we do the same for the compression API? This is a major pain as
well, and results (on my 128-core workstation) in 32 MiB permanently
tied up in scratch buffers in the scomp-to-acomp adaptation layer
because most of the underlying implementations are compression
libraries operating on plain virtual addresses, and so the
scatterlists needs to be copied into a buffer and back to perform the
actual transformation.

The only user user of the async compression interface is zswap, but it
blocks on the completion so it is actually synchronous as well.
