Its really difficult to have perf building with so many dependent
libraries, mowing out some should be in order.

Thanks.

Agreed.

I'd rather require everybody to be up to the latest trends, but I really
don't think that is a reasonable expectation.

Unsure, Jiri?

But yeah, previous experiences with Andrii were that we can do not too
costly feature checks, not using .c programs that would fail if some
required feature wasn't present but instead would just do some grep on a
header and if some "smell" wasn't scent, just fail the cap query.
