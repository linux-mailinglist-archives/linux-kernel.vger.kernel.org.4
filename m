For me it was months waiting without any feedback. So I think you are
lucky :) or atleast better than me at poking arm64 maintainers.

I agree here. We should be able to make the foundations robust later
on. IMHO, until we turn on features surrounding pseudo NMIs, I am not
sure how we can have true confidence in the underlying robustness.
