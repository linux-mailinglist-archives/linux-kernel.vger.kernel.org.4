I know that pef2256_setup_e1() is quite big and I will look at a way
to split it in a consistent way.

Maybe the issue is that MFD was not a good choice.
The "function" provided are not independent of each other.
The "main" driver (pef2256.c) needs to do the setup and handle the interrupt.
The "function" provided are some glues in order to be used in some sub-systems
such as audio. Indeed, ASoC needs a codec DAI to be connected to a CPU DAI.
These "functions" need to be started (ie probe()) after the pef2256 setup was
done. So a start (probe()) order relationship is needed.

If a MFD driver needs independent children to handle independent functions,
the pef2256 does not fit well as a MFD driver.

I switched from misc to MFD just to handle child DT nodes instead of having
phandles. Using child DT nodes instead of phandles is really a good thing and
need to be kept.
The switch to MFD was probably not the best thing to do.

What do you think if I switched back the pef2256 "main" driver (pef2256.c) to
misc ?

I ran checkpatch.pl, not checkpatch.pl --strict.

The spaces related the #define can be seen on many other drivers.

#define FOO_REG_BAR	0x10
#define   FOO_REG_BAR_BIT0	BIT(0)
#define   FOO_REG_BAR_BIT4	BIT(4)

The first line is the register offset and the other lines (indented) are
the bits description related to this register.

I will have a look and fix them in the next iteration.
