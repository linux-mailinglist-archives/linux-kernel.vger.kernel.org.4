This is actually a separate problem that Domenico was preparing a
patch for. Writeback is a reclaim operation, so it should have access
to the memory reserves (PF_MEMALLOC). Persistent -ENOMEM shouldn't
exist. It actually used have reserve access when writeback happened
directly from inside the store (reclaim -> swapout path). When
writeback was moved out to the async worker, it lost reserve access as
an unintended side effect. This should be fixed, so we don't OOM while
we try to free memory.

Should it be fixed before merging this patch? I don't think the
ordering matters. Right now the -ENOMEM case invokes OOM, so it isn't
really persistent either. Retrying a few times in that case certainly
doesn't seem to make things worse.

A page that fails to reclaim is put back to the tail of the LRU, so
for all intents and purposes it will be skipped. In the rare and
extreme case where it's the only page left on the list, I again don't
see how retrying a few times will make the situation worse.

In practice, IMO there is little upside in trying to be more
discerning about the error codes. Simple seems better here.
