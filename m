Thank you both!

I queued the following wordsmithed version, so please let me know if I
messed anything up.

    rcu: Further comment and explain the state space of GP sequences
    
    The state space of the GP sequence number isn't documented and the
    definitions of its special values are scattered.  This commit therefore
    gathers some common knowledge near the grace-period sequence-number
    definitions.
