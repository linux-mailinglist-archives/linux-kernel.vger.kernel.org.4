Hi,

Resending this in plaintext mode.
I apologize for the duplicate mail.

Sorry,
Mark Francis
----------------------
Hello,

I tried the test patch with the "ASPM: can't restore L1SS while L1
enabled" message on the v6.1 tag.

I tried setting the ASPM policy to default rather than powersupersave.
Tested twice.
The result is I get to see the messages in the kernel log. The system
resumed successfully in all tests.
[  330.438136] ACPI: PM: Waking up from system sleep state S3
[  330.445959] ACPI: EC: interrupt unblocked
[  330.446174] pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: ASPM: can't restore L1SS while
L1 enabled (0x0042)
[  330.446177] pcieport 0000:00:1c.6: ASPM: can't restore L1SS while

[  330.580820] ACPI: EC: event unblocked
[  330.581066] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Starting disk

I also noticed that these messages also pop out when activating a
userspace powersave tool (i.e., tlp).
(I was restoring my machine after the test, that is, re-enabling
services like tlp.
 Then, I accidentally knocked off the wall plug with my foot causing
tlp to activate its battery profile)
[ 4065.786154] pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: ASPM: can't restore L1SS while
L1 enabled (0x0042)
[ 4065.799553] r8169 0000:03:00.0: ASPM: can't restore L1SS while L1
enabled (0x0142)
[ 4065.969703] r8169 0000:03:00.0 enp3s0: Link is Down

I really wish I could also try and speculate other solutions but I am
ignorant with respect to the PCIe specifications.

Nevertheless, Hope this helps.
Let me know if I also need to test the case where the commits are reverted.

Thanks,
