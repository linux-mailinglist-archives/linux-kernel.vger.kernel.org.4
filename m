Not really: TPM 1.2 way predates my interest in the TPM subsystem, and
I've only ever done patches to 2.0.  I can look at the paths
theoretically, but I don't have any hardware.  Self Test failures tend
to be hardware specific, so even poking around in the emulator is
unlikely to give what might be the cause.

One of the TPM maintainers with hardware (possibly the specific TPM ...
what is it, by the way?) needs to get involved.
