Up to now, there does not seems to be a better solution to this
problem in term of maintainability, reusability and ease of use.

Again, patching the pre-boot description (ACPI or DT) is not an option,
the user is entitled to plug the card in whatever PCI slot he wants.
This is either probbly not possible and ACPI based system and would
require a difficult setup to even try to achieve that. This would also
result in two different description to support the same device.

Agreed, moreover saying that "the overlay support is fragile" seems to
be a shortcut to do nothing and move all the support outside of the
kernel. If buggy, then it would be better to fix this support (if there
are real problems encountered with it) or kill it by removing it
entirely if not usable (option 1 would of course be preferred).

I've been able to use the same patch set with a X86 QEMU system by
attaching my physical PCI card to it. No issues were encountered
(although the usage was rather limited). Gaining some users of this
support would allow to gather more feedback.
