Ugh, right.  But that case can be handled by zapping non-WB ranges on CR0.CD being
set.  Hmm, and KVM would need to zap everything if CR0.CD is toggled with MTRRs
disabled, but I don't think OVMF ever does that.  Zapping on CR0.CD toggling would
would likely introduce a small performance hit for SeaBIOS due to SeaBIOS clearing
CR0.CD immediately after SIPI, i.e. with MTRRs disabled, but that's arguably a
correctness fix since the quirk means KVM incorrectly runs the vCPU with WB SPTEs
until MTRRs are programmed.

With precise+batched zapping, zapping non-WB ranges even when CR0.CD is set should
still be a healthy performance boost for OVMF.

No, because this assumes too many things about the guest, and completely falls
apart if the guest reboots.

I am not willing to lean on the historical commit messages for the quirk to
justify any change.  I'm not at all convinced that there was any meaningful thought
put into ensuring correctness.

On your system, for your setup.  The quirk terrifies me because it likely affects
every KVM-based VM out there (I can't find a single VMM that disables the quirk).
These changes are limited to VMs with noncoherent DMA, but still.

In short, I am steadfastly against any change that piles more arbitrary behavior
functional behavior on top of the quirk, especially when that behavior relies on
heuristics to try and guess what the guest is doing.
