Good point! I did not find a statement specifically about the breakpoint 
bypass, but by piecing up together the explanations from their manual, I 
think we can conclude that it is safe:

Based on AMD64 Architecture Programmerâ€™s Manual Volume 2
7.6.1 Cache Organization and Operation
Cross-Modifying Code

The subsection "Asynchronous modification" describes in detail what 
happens if we concurrently update an instruction that is concurrently 
executed. The good news is that there is no mention of an evil Boeman 
triggering any kind of general protection fault when updating 
instructions concurrently with their execution. So inserting a 
single-byte breakpoint as first byte of an instruction is just the 
simplest scenario covered by that section:

"Such modifications must be done via a single store to the target 
thread's instruction stream that is contained entirely within a 
naturally-aligned quadword, and is subject to the constraints given 
here. A key aspect is that, although the store is performed atomically, 
the affected quadword may be read more than once in the process of 
extracting instruction bytes from it. This can result in the following 
scenarios resulting from a single store:

[...]

2. A modification to one instruction A that changes it to two 
instructions A'-B will only result in execution of A'-B.

[...]"

Then there is the "Synchronous modification" section which basically 
describes how serializing instructions can be issued before proceeding 
to execute the modified instructions.

So AFAIU the XMC breakpoint insertion without stopping the world is 
covered by AMD's "Asynchronous modification" section, and the rest of 
the breakpoint-bypass technique using serializing instructions relying 
on IPIs in the kernel, and on membarrier sync-core in userspace, is 
guaranteed by the "Synchronous modification" section.

Unfortunately I cannot find anything with respect to asynchronous 
cross-modification of code stated as clearly in Intel's documentation.

Thanks,

Mathieu
