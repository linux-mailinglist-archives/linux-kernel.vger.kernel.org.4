I still don't really like that:

1) It feels like we are curing a symptom for which we don't know the cause.
   Which RCU write side caller is the source of this slow boot? Some tracepoints
   reporting the wait duration within synchronize_rcu() calls between the end of
   the kernel boot and the end of userspace boot may be helpful.
   
2) The kernel boot was already covered before this patch so this is about
   userspace code calling into the kernel. Is that piece of code also called
   after the boot? In that case are we missing a conversion from
   synchronize_rcu() to synchronize_rcu_expedited() somewhere? Because then
   the problem is more general than just boot.

This needs to be analyzed first and if it happens that the issue really
needs to be fixed with telling the kernel that userspace has completed
booting, eg: because the problem is not in a few callsites that need conversion
to expedited but instead in the accumulation of lots of calls that should stay
as is:

3) This arbitrary timeout looks dangerous to me as latency sensitive code
   may run right after the boot. Either you choose a value that is too low
   and you miss the optimization or the value is too high and you may break
   things.

4) This should be fixed the way you did:
   a) a kernel parameter like you did
   b) The init process (systemd?) tells the kernel when it judges that userspace
      has completed booting.
   c) Make these interfaces more generic, maybe that information will be useful
      outside RCU. For example the kernel parameter should be
      "user_booted_reported" and the sysfs (should be sysctl?):
      kernel.user_booted = 1
   d) But yuck, this means we must know if the init process supports that...

For these reasons, let's make sure we know exactly what is going on first.

Thanks.
