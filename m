Hi Alan,

I see. Thanks for explaining. So it seems that maybe the issue is
slightly more urgent than we first thought. Given that folks aren't keen
on the BPF_KFUNC macro approach that wraps the function definition,
maybe we can go back to the __bpf_kfunc proposal from [0] as a stopgap
solution until we can properly support something like
EXPORT_SYMBOL_KFUNC. Alexei -- what do you think?

Does just using __attribute__((__used__)) work? Many of these kfuncs are
called on hotpaths in BPF programs, so compiling them with no
optimization is not an ideal or likely even realistic option. Not to
mention the fact that not all kfuncs are BPF-exclusive (meaning you can
export a normal kernel function that's called by the main kernel as a
kfunc).
