In practice, not much difference other than documenting shared accesses.
Which can be valuable.

In theory, when you do a normal C-language store, the compiler is within
its rights to use the variable for temporary storage between the time
of the last read from that variable and the next write to that variable.
Back to practice, I have not heard of this happening for shared variables.
On the other hand, compilers really do this for on-stack variables whose
addresses are not taken, which is one of the reasons that gdb might say
that the variable is optimized out when you try to look at its value.

So the potential is there, and if it was my code, I would therefore use
READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE().

							Thanx, Paul
