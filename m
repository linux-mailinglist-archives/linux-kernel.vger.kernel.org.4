Not sure if it has been figured/discussed out already, pointing one possible scenario. 

Taking the formulas:
busiest->sum_nr_running * local->group_weight >= local->sum_nr_running * busiest->group_weight + busiest->group_weight + local->group_weight
and calulate_imbalance:
(busiest->sum_nr_running * local->group_weight) - (local->sum_nr_running * busiest->group_weight) / (busiest->group_weight + local->group_weight)


First lets say imbalance was like this. same example as before. sched_group in [busy_cpus/idle_cpus/group_weight]
[3/9/12] - local group.
[3/1/4] - busy group.

3*12 >= 3*4+12+4 --> true and imbalance would be (3*12-3*4)/(12+4) -- 24/16 >> 1 -- lets say 1. 
we will balance, good.

[4/8/12] 
[2/2/4] 
There will not be further load balances. good.

a new process comes, it would be scheduled on [4/8/120 sched group as that would be idlest. 
[5/7/12] 
[2/2/4] 

Process running on [2/2/4] exits. then in this scenario do you expect the balance to happen again? Since balancing would result into optimal performance.
[5/7/12] - busy_group
[1/3/4] - local group

5*4 >= 1*12+12+4 --> will not balance. 

[5/7/12] - local group
[1/3/4] - busy group 
1*12 >= 5*4 + 12 + 4 --> will not balance. 

Is this scenario needs to be handled as well?
