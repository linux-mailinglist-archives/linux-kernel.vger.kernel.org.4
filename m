Thank you for the advice, Mr. Moore.

It is really my second attempt at patch submission. I've seen
later that other contributors add RESEND or increase the patch
set version.

For the maintainer list, I have trusted the output of a script.
But yes, it's probably best to check thoroughly twice.

I have already realised that simply calling kmem_cache_destroy()
would not even deallocate all possibly allocated subnodes which
I saw from the source.

It is based on the idea of the userspace programs in which I
always relinquish memory on the heap instead of relying in just
exit(). (This also allows greater flexibility with signals,
but that is OT now.)

If this is bound not to cause any problems with TPMs or vTMPs
on the virtual machines, maybe it's a non-issue.

Yes, I was worried about the leaks that would be destroyed
all at once or in an undefined order.

I have learned about the devm_kalloc() family of functions and
how it is not used here.

Thank you for considering the patchset at such short notice
and of course I see more experienced developer's ideas dismissed,
so I do not take it with disappointment.

I was already aware that there is currently no mechanism to call
this .release() callback or hook, how should we call it.

Thank you very much for your review.

As I said, I was worried that it could cause problems, in particular
with vTMPs I've read about, randomness for security, nonces that
may not repeat even on virtual server rollbacks or restores to
bare metal and other RFC 4086 considerations which are not even
completely clear to me, as I do not consider myself an expert
in either field.

I am a believer of proper cleanups, and this will not change, but
you have greater experience and knowledge and might find such
mechanism impractical, which I respect with Vulcan aspired logic
and respect :-)

This patch attempt gave me a great brainstorming on how the Linux
drivers work, and I am content with that result. Code of Conduct
warned that newbie kernel developers get ideas on how things should
be done that are not accepted.

Thank you once again, and really have a nice and blessed weekend!

Best regards,
Mirsad
