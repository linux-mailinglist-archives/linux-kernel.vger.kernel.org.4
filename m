SYSFS option requires CONFIG_SYSFS, which reqiures CONFIG_KVM_TDX to 
select CONFIG_SYSFS.

Note, before this TDX enabling series, KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP is a VM 
scope ioctl, that only serves for SEV and no other implementation uses 
it. I see no reason why cannot introduce a new IOCTL in x86 KVM that 
serves only one vendor.

We choose KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP for TDX platform scope, just because we 
reuse KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP for TDX VM-scope and extend it to TDX vcpu 
scope. It's just to avoid defining a new IOCTL number.

We can rename it to KVM_GET_CC_CAPABILITIES, and even return different 
capabilities based on VM type. And even, if SNP wants to use it, I think 
it can wrap SNP driver calls inside this IOCTL?

kvm.ko is special that it needs to serve two vendors. Sometime it's 
unaviodable that an interface is only used by one vendor.
