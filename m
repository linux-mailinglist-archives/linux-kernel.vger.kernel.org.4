- Mention Clang in compiler requirements.

- Use ``annotations`` for inline code.

- Rework remote coverage collection documentation for better clarity.

 Remote coverage collection
 --------------------------
 
-With KCOV_ENABLE coverage is collected only for syscalls that are issued
-from the current process. With KCOV_REMOTE_ENABLE it's possible to collect
-coverage for arbitrary parts of the kernel code, provided that those parts
-are annotated with kcov_remote_start()/kcov_remote_stop().
-
-This allows to collect coverage from two types of kernel background
-threads: the global ones, that are spawned during kernel boot in a limited
-number of instances (e.g. one USB hub_event() worker thread is spawned per
-USB HCD); and the local ones, that are spawned when a user interacts with
-some kernel interface (e.g. vhost workers); as well as from soft
-interrupts.
-
-To enable collecting coverage from a global background thread or from a
-softirq, a unique global handle must be assigned and passed to the
-corresponding kcov_remote_start() call. Then a userspace process can pass
-a list of such handles to the KCOV_REMOTE_ENABLE ioctl in the handles
-array field of the kcov_remote_arg struct. This will attach the used kcov
-device to the code sections, that are referenced by those handles.
-
-Since there might be many local background threads spawned from different
-userspace processes, we can't use a single global handle per annotation.
-Instead, the userspace process passes a non-zero handle through the
-common_handle field of the kcov_remote_arg struct. This common handle gets
-saved to the kcov_handle field in the current task_struct and needs to be
-passed to the newly spawned threads via custom annotations. Those threads
-should in turn be annotated with kcov_remote_start()/kcov_remote_stop().
-
-Internally kcov stores handles as u64 integers. The top byte of a handle
-is used to denote the id of a subsystem that this handle belongs to, and
-the lower 4 bytes are used to denote the id of a thread instance within
-that subsystem. A reserved value 0 is used as a subsystem id for common
-handles as they don't belong to a particular subsystem. The bytes 4-7 are
-currently reserved and must be zero. In the future the number of bytes
-used for the subsystem or handle ids might be increased.
-
-When a particular userspace process collects coverage via a common
-handle, kcov will collect coverage for each code section that is annotated
-to use the common handle obtained as kcov_handle from the current
-task_struct. However non common handles allow to collect coverage
-selectively from different subsystems.
+Besides collecting coverage data from handlers of syscalls issued from a
+userspace process, KCOV can also collect coverage for parts of the kernel
+executing in other contexts - so-called "remote" coverage.
+
+Using KCOV to collect remote coverage requires:
+
+1. Modifying kernel code to annotate the code section from where coverage
+   should be collected with ``kcov_remote_start`` and ``kcov_remote_stop``.
+
+2. Using ``KCOV_REMOTE_ENABLE`` instead of ``KCOV_ENABLE`` in the userspace
+   process that collects coverage.
+
+Both ``kcov_remote_start`` and ``kcov_remote_stop`` annotations and the
+``KCOV_REMOTE_ENABLE`` ioctl accept handles that identify particular coverage
+collection sections. The way a handle is used depends on the context where the
+matching code section executes.
+
+KCOV supports collecting remote coverage from the following contexts:
+
+1. Global kernel background tasks. These are the tasks that are spawned during
+   kernel boot in a limited number of instances (e.g. one USB ``hub_event``
+   worker is spawned per one USB HCD).
+
+2. Local kernel background tasks. These are spawned when a userspace process
+   interacts with some kernel interface and are usually killed when the process
+   exits (e.g. vhost workers).
+
+3. Soft interrupts.
+
+For #1 and #3, a unique global handle must be chosen and passed to the
+corresponding ``kcov_remote_start`` call. Then a userspace process must pass
+this handle to ``KCOV_REMOTE_ENABLE`` in the ``handles`` array field of the
+``kcov_remote_arg`` struct. This will attach the used KCOV device to the code
+section referenced by this handle. Multiple global handles identifying
+different code sections can be passed at once.
+
+For #2, the userspace process instead must pass a non-zero handle through the
+``common_handle`` field of the ``kcov_remote_arg`` struct. This common handle
+gets saved to the ``kcov_handle`` field in the current ``task_struct`` and
+needs to be passed to the newly spawned local tasks via custom kernel code
+modifications. Those tasks should in turn use the passed handle in their
+``kcov_remote_start`` and ``kcov_remote_stop`` annotations.
+
+KCOV follows a predefined format for both global and common handles. Each
+handle is a ``u64`` integer. Currently, only the one top and the lower 4 bytes
+are used. Bytes 4-7 are reserved and must be zero.
+
+For global handles, the top byte of the handle denotes the id of a subsystem
+this handle belongs to. For example, KCOV uses ``1`` as the USB subsystem id.
+The lower 4 bytes of a global handle denote the id of a task instance within
+that subsystem. For example, each ``hub_event`` worker uses the USB bus number
+as the task instance id.
+
+For common handles, a reserved value ``0`` is used as a subsystem id, as such
+handles don't belong to a particular subsystem. The lower 4 bytes of a common
+handle identify a collective instance of all local tasks spawned by the
+userspace process that passed a common handle to ``KCOV_REMOTE_ENABLE``.
+
+In practice, any value can be used for common handle instance id if coverage
+is only collected from a single userspace process on the system. However, if
+common handles are used by multiple processes, unique instance ids must be
+used for each process. One option is to use the process id as the common
+handle instance id.
+
+The following program demonstrates using KCOV to collect coverage from both
+local tasks spawned by the process and the global task that handles USB bus #1:
