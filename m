Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. As many (most?)
kernel developer don't keep an eye on it, I decided to forward it by
mail. Quoting from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216479 :

See the ticket for more details. I chose to forward this to the power
management developers, as I assume the "kvm: exiting hardware
virtualization" is simply the last thing that's printed. Hope that
wasn't a stupid assumption.

BTW, let me use this mail to also add the report to the list of tracked
regressions to ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks:

#regzbot introduced: v5.17..v5.18
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216479
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
