Maybe this helps explain all the completely unmaintainable ASPM
garbage in amdgpu and radeon.

If these devices are broken, we need quirks for them.  We can't avoid
ASPM in general just because random devices break.

The kernel parameters and config options been there pretty much from
the beginning.  We didn't have the per-device sysfs knobs until very
recently.

Hot-added devices power up with ASPM disabled.  This policy would mean
the user has to explicitly enable it, which doesn't seem practical to
me.

I want quirks for BROKEN devices.  Quirks for working hardware is a
maintenance nightmare.
