KVM installs WB memtype when the quirk is enabled, thus no need to zap.  KVM
currently zaps everything when the quirk is disabled, and I'm not proposing that
be changed.

The quirk throws all of that out the window.  As the quirk is implemented in KVM,
i.e. what guests have been running with for years, the MTRRs are completely
ignored when CR0.CD.

No, because after zapping, CR0.CD=1, and thus when KVM re-installs SPTEs the guest
will get WB memory for _everything_ once again.

Not unless I'm missing something.  I don't see any way for the guest to get UC
memory when CR0.CD=1 and the quirk is enabled.  The behavior is nonsensical IMO,
but that's been KVM's quirky behavior for years.

	if (is_mmio)
		return MTRR_TYPE_UNCACHABLE << VMX_EPT_MT_EPTE_SHIFT;

	if (!kvm_arch_has_noncoherent_dma(vcpu->kvm))
		return (MTRR_TYPE_WRBACK << VMX_EPT_MT_EPTE_SHIFT) | VMX_EPT_IPAT_BIT;

	if (kvm_read_cr0_bits(vcpu, X86_CR0_CD)) {
		if (kvm_check_has_quirk(vcpu->kvm, KVM_X86_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED))
			cache = MTRR_TYPE_WRBACK;  <===== Overrides MTRR settings
		else
			cache = MTRR_TYPE_UNCACHABLE;

		return (cache << VMX_EPT_MT_EPTE_SHIFT) | VMX_EPT_IPAT_BIT;
	}

	return kvm_mtrr_get_guest_memory_type(vcpu, gfn) << VMX_EPT_MT_EPTE_SHIFT;

It doesn't actually require non-coherent DMA within the CR0.CD=1 window though.
A SPTE installed while CR0.CD=1 could overlap a *future* non-coherent DMA range,
i.e. not zapping when CR0.CD is cleared would leave a stale WB SPTE.  This is
especially likely with hugepages, e.g. if KVM can create 1GiB mappings.

Yes, we can ignore !X86_FEATURE_MTRR guests.  If someone wants to run such a
setup with non-coherent DMA, they're welcome to send patches and write a lengthy
explanation of why they want to run such insanity :-)

I don't think tracking "dirty" MTRRs releative to a per-VM copy will work because
of the weird behavior of the quirk.  E.g. if the below happens, vCPU1's WB SPTE
won't be zapped because MTRRx wasn't "dirty".

     vCPU0         vCPU1
     ----------    ----------
1.   MTRRx = UC 
2.   CR0.CD = 1    CR0.CD=1
3.                 SPTE = WB
4.                 MTRRx = UC
5.                 CR0.CD=0

Another problem is that while only one vCPU will trigger the zap, KVM needs to
stall all vCPUs that dirtied MTRRs *relative to the original per-VM state*.  E.g.
if the per-VM state for MTRRx is WB and both vCPU1 and vCPU2 dirty an MTRR and
both clear CR0.CD, then KVM needs to stall vCPU1 and vCPU2 regardless of which
vCPU actually does the zapping.

And when handling the transition from dirty=>clean, KVM would need to prevent
writes to MTRRs while grabbing the snapshot of dirty MTRRs, i.e. to-be-zapped
ranges, in order to provide stable view of the clean per-VM copy.

In other words, the net effect will essentially be what I sketched out with the
precise zapping, but with the added downside of serializing writes to MTRRs while
transitioning the per-VM state from dirty=>clean.
