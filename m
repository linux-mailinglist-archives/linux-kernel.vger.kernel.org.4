As you know, AMD pmu lacks an architected method (such as CPUID) to
indicate that the VM does not have any pmu counters available for the
current platform. Guests like Linux tend to check if their first counters
exist and work properly to infer that other pmu counters exist.

If KVM chooses to emulate greater than 1 less than 4 counters, then the
AMD guest PMU agent may assume that there are legacy 4 counters all
present (it's what the APM specifies), which requires the legacy code
to add #GP error handling for counters that should exist but actually not.

So at Sean's suggestion, we took a conservative approach. If KVM detects
less than 4 counters, we think KVM (under the current configuration and
platform) is not capable of emulating the most basic AMD pmu capability.
A large number of legacy instances are ready for 0 or 4+ ctrs, not 2 or 3.

Does this help you ? I wouldn't mind a better move.
