Hm, so in summary:

1) memory.reclaim would demote and reclaim like today, but it would
   change to only count reclaimed pages against the goal.

2) memory.demote would only demote.

   a) What if the demotion targets are full? Would it reclaim or fail?

3) Would memory.reclaim and memory.demote still need nodemasks? Would
   they return -EINVAL if a) memory.reclaim gets passed only toptier
   nodes or b) memory.demote gets passed any lasttier nodes?
