Hmm, as pointed out in http://lkml.kernel.org/r/Y5bsmpCyeryu3Zz1@dhcp22.suse.cz
I've failed to see through all the consequences of the implementation.
SO my bad here to add my ack before fully understanding all the
implications.

Sure if we can converge to a proper implementation during the rc phase
then it would be ok. I cannot speak for others but at least for me
upcoming 2 weeks would be mostly offline so I cannot really contribute
much. A revert would be much more easier from the coordination POV IMHO.

Also I do not think there is any strong reason to rush this in. I do not
really see any major problems to have this extension in 6.2
