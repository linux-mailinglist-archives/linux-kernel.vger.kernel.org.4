Hi all,

Sorry for late response.
Just two cents to constructively defend myself.

My 1st approach was to follow C++ library and I have proposed 'exchange' 
[1][2].
Later I have also showed/suggested Rust's approach [3][4]:
- 'replace' for __xchg,
- 'take' for fetch_and_zero

Anyway it ended as is.

The logic was just to focus on introduction of the helper, providing few 
(not all) examples of usage and finish i915 conversion later, when the 
helper will be accepted.
Conversion should be split anyway - as i915 uses different repo for 
i915/gt, sorry for not clearly stating this.
