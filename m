No, this is not really answering my question. See
Y9LQ615H13RmG7wL@dhcp22.suse.cz which already explains how the draining
would be triggered. This is not really happening on any operation.

I am really asking for specific workloads which are running multiple
processes on a mix of isolated and non-isolated cpus yet they share
memcg so that they can interfere. The consequences of the common memcg
are described above.
