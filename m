I'd misunderstood how this worked and not read the spec :( I wrongly thought portdrv
did the query first and allocated the vectors after, but that's not
the case.  It first allocates max entries, then frees them all and then
allocates the ones that we find present.
We should probably look to do something similar to that though I'm not sure
even that code is always optimal.

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc2/source/drivers/pci/pcie/portdrv_core.c#L101

In short that calls:
/* Allocate the maximum possible number of MSI/MSI-X vectors */
nr_entries = pci_alloc_irq_vectors(dev, 1, PCIE_PORT_MAX_MSI_ENTRIES,
			PCI_IRQ_MSIX | PCI_IRQ_MSI);

/* See how many and which Interrupt Message Numbers we actually use */
nvec = pcie_message_numbers(dev, mask, &pme, &aer, &dpc);

if (nvec != nr_entries) {
	pci_free_irq_vectors(dev);

	nr_entries = pci_alloc_irq_vectors(dev, nvec, nvec,
			PCI_IRQ_MSIX | PCI_IRQ_MSI);
}

My worry here is that the implicit assumption is that the vectors won't
move if we reduce the overall number of vectors we are asking for...

However, imagine the case that we have a feature the driver doesn't know
about that was previously at a higher vector.  After reducing the vectors
allocated the hardware might decide that feature needs it's own vector whereas
some others can be combined.  Hence we'd end up with a less than ideal packing
for the features we actually support.

Could do something iterative to solve this if it actually matters (increase
number of vectors until the layout matches what we get with max possible vectors).

+CC linux-pci and Bjorn for their take on this.  Maybe I'm over thinking things
and in reality this never happens.
