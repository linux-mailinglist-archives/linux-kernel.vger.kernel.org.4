Thanks for your suggestion.

I think if journal super block has 'j_errno' ext4_clear_journal_err() 
will commit error info.
The scenario we need to deal with is:(1) journal super block has no 
'j_errno'; (2) super
block has detail error info, but 'es->s_state' has no 'EXT4_ERROR_FS', 
It means super
block in journal has no error flag and the newest super block has error 
flag. so we
need to store error flag to 'es->s_state', and commit it to disk.If 
'es->s_state' has
  'EXT4_ERROR_FS', it means super block in journal has error flag, so we 
do not need
to store error flag in super block.

I don't know if I can explain my idea of repair.
