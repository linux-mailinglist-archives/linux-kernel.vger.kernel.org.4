Reminder: a lot of the affected users can only be reached through the
bugzilla ticket (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217412 )
that made me start this thread. Sorry for this mess, but I can't simply
CC them because on account creation users are told that the "email
address will never be displayed to logged out users". Bugbot will
hopefully soon make this sort of problems history.

See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217412#c26 and later â€“
it at least solved the problem for one user.

But it's all a mess (at least afaics). Earlier in that ticket some other
user said things work with 6.4-rc kernel, while for another confirmed
things are still broken. So maybe we deal with more than one problem. Or
testing went sideways for some of the users.

Ciao, Thorsten
