I believe it is because there were arm64 platforms (early) that added a
consumer descriptor in the host bridge CRS with MMIO registers space in
it (I am not sure I can find the bug report - it has been a while,
remember the issue with non-ECAM config space and where to add the MMIO
resource required to "extend" MCFG config space ? I will never forget
that :)).

I don't think it can work *without* quirks.

If, for reasons that I don't understand, anyone would add consumer
resources in the host bridge CRS that include at the same time PCI
memory windows and bridge MMIO registers, how can Windows detect which
one is what ? There is no way - at least none I can see.

Most likely, on platforms on which Windows boots, nobody ever added
in FW MMIO register space as a consumer resource in the host bridge
CRS (or Windows has a quirk mechanism for those).

I don't think it can do it, would be happy to be wrong.

I can ask, that will not solve anything but at least we know.
