Thanks for the detailed description and putting this together.

I am wondering if it makes sense to rename this as early_ci_levels or
something similar to indicate it is to do with just level information only ?
If not, it needs to be documented if the variable is not more specific.
I am sure I will forget it and will be wondering to understand in few
months time ðŸ˜„.

Other than that, it looks good. I will try to push this for v6.4 but it
may be bit late as it is good to have it in -next for sometime to get more
testing. Anyways send v4, will put it into -next ASAP and see what is the
best course of action after that.
