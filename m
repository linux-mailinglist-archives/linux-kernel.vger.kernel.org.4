Not AFAIK, you could just create a list_head somewhere appropriate (some snp
state structure?) and put the pages there, maybe with a counter exposed in
debugs. The point would be mostly that if something goes so wrong it would
be leaking substantial amounts of memory, we can at least recognize the
cause (but I suppose the dmesg will be also full of messages) and e.g. find
the pages in a crash dump.
