It is general Linux kernel policy not to have internal APIs with zero
users. The Rust folks get pushback all the time for upstreaming stuff
piecewise even though in that case there are known, upcoming,
in-the-pipeline users (we do that too with rtkit but we always have
upcoming users downstream and we're small enough nobody notices and
complains :P). Having dead APIs that nobody uses and nobody can point at
an upcoming use case for is technical debt. That's why my first patch in
this series cleans up one of those on our side.

Using a fixed size buffer is not the problem, having no blocking
mechanism when it gets full is the problem.

That's not the issue, the issue is putting stuff *into* the queue, not
taking it *out* of the queue and sending it to the hardware.

If I do this:

for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    mbox_send_message(...);
}

Then, unless the remote is fast enough to accept messages faster than
the CPU can send them, some of those sends will fail and refuse to send
data, once the subsystem side queue is full.

That is broken because it either loses data or forces the user to
implement retry poll loops, neither of which is appropriate. The mailbox
subsystem knows when the hardware can send data, it can properly block
the send on that signal (which is exactly what my refactor in this
series does when the hardware queue gets full).

If we instead wait for the tx completion stuff before sending, then that
defeats the point of having a queue because you'd be waiting for each
prior message before sending a new one. And then you need to keep track
of the last completion. And it requires a global serialization on the
client side anyway unless you can guarantee you have less than
QUEUE_SIZE clients. And you still have the issue of having to keep the
message data around until that completion fires, which is more code and
allocator overhead over just passing it inline, since it's a tiny amount
of data. Etc etc etc.

It is a bad API, using it properly and reliably requires basically
re-implementing part of the subsystem logic in the consumer to work
around the issues.

For reference: Our GPU benchmarks will easily hit 18000+ TX calls per
second through mailbox, even more for some corner cases (this is why I
want to implement coalescing when the HW queue already has identical
doorbells, to reduce that). More importantly, although the GPU side
firmware is usually fast at processing this (it has an IRQ handler and
its own doorbell coalescing), when GPU faults or errors happen it has
latency spikes, and then we *must* block mailbox sends until it is ready
to handle messages again. Dropping messages on the floor is not an
option. This *has* to be 100% reliable or users' machines crash.

It isn't. There's no code rage here, that patch was a long time ago.
What that patch told me was that cleaning up mailbox to work for us was
going to be an uphill battle, and then over the course of the year+
after that it has become very evident that there is a lot of work to do
to make mailbox work for us. Hence, the conclusion that we're better off
without. Honestly, at this point, even without that rejection I'd still
want to move away because there's just so much work to do to get all the
features we need and bugs we're hitting fixed and no realistic way to
test other consumers/drivers to make sure we don't break them in the
process.

As I said, there's a very clear sign here that this is the right move:
the overall code size goes down. After this series we have:

- Less code in total (much less actually executing)
- That works better
- And is easier to understand and debug
- And requires less maintenance effort to improve

If other platforms come to the same conclusion for their use case then
yes, they should move away from mailbox as well. I would expect that
might be the case for a subset, not all, of users. If more users follow,
that should be a sign to you that the mailbox subsystem isn't as useful
as you'd like :)

Put another way: common code should actually save you lines of code. If
it's causing you to spend more lines of code to use it properly than it
saves, it is not useful and does not actually improve the situation.

If they are really doing the same thing, sure. And then might be a good
time to re-think mailbox and what it should do and how it should offer
this common code to drivers, in a way that works for more users and
actually saves everyone time and maintenance effort, with less burden.

Not really, because it's your subsystem so we do actually need you to
ack the driver deletion patch if it's going to go through our tree.
That's the rules. "Acked" doesn't mean "I am happy with this", it means
"I am okay with this" ;)
