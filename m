Hello,
Thank you for considering this.

There is a V3 of this patch series [1|, that fixes the issues
encountered with the V2.
The debugging following this thread was discussed off-list with Damien Le M=
oal.
The V3 has been tested successfully by Damien Le Moal [2]

I will submit a V4 next week, since there are minor changes that were
suggested in
the threads for the V3 (mostly minor changes in code style, macros, comment=
s).

I hope it can be considered for v6.4, thank you.

Notes on what was discovered off-list :

The issues regarding BAR reset were due to power supply issues (PCI cable
jumping host 3V3 supply to SoC 3V3 supply, and are fixed with proper cablin=
g).
a few LCRC errors are normal with PCIe, the number will depend on
signal integrity
at the physical layer (cabling).


Best regards,
Rick
