Now I'm confused again about what "HotPlugSupportInD3" means.  The MS
web page [1] says it identifies Root Ports capable of handling hot
plug events while in D3.  That sounds kind of related to _S0W: If _S0W
says "I can wake myself from D3hot and D3cold", how is that different
from "I can handle hotplug events in D3"?

This patch says that if dev's Root Port has "HotPlugSupportInD3", we
don't need _PS0 or _PR0 for dev.  I guess that must be true, because
previously the fact that we checked for "HotPlugSupportInD3" meant the
device did NOT have _PS0 or _PR0.
