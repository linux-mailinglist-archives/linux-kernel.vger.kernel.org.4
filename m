Of course: not because those messages are hardly understandable but
because those messages indicate only the cause, and the exact end
result can't be always known from the kernel at that point.  A lack of
physical failing hardware?  Not enabled devices?  Who knows.  There
might be some alternative, even a user-space driver.

Oh you suggest that we should put "please RMA or seek help online" to
each printk of KERN_ERR level, if it saves the world? ;)

IMO, what matters for users is whether the system works or not.  It's
not how the kernel message appears.  A kernel message may help for
diagnose, but the message itself is no solution; that is, the most
importance of a kernel message is that it indicates a real error that
can be diagnosed by developers.

If the end effect is pretty sure, a message may be more chatty.  OTOH,
people are annoyed by such too verbosity, too.  So it needs a sensible
choice.

Right, that's why I wrote it's a dilemma.

All those depend on the driver implementation and the hardware
implementation.  There is no general answer at all, unfortunately.

Yes, some errors can be downgraded to warn or even to info.
I myself find ACPI is way too chatty, too.

So I believe something we can improve is to define some more clear
guideline for KERN_ERR level errors.
