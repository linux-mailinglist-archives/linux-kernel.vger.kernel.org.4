Well, like most people I have lots of ideas for things I'd like to work
on in the domain I'm active in, as the stuff I mentioned in my previous
mail show. But that's life, we all have todo and wish lists. Sooner or
later I'll likely get down to some of that stuff. But if somebody said
"we'd like you to work on this or that rather sooner than later", then
sure, help would be great. Especially help with maintaining and
improving regzbot would be great from my point of view.

But what right now would help most with regression tracking are two
things that can only be solved by educating people:

 * It would help tremendously if reporters and developers would at least
CC the regressions list on regression reports so I become aware of them;
and ideally they would tell regzbot about the report themselves of
course. Right now many people don't do either, so I have to scan various
mails every day to even get aware of most regression reports (I do this
with lei, which searches for things like "regress", "bisect", "revert",
"first bad commit", which generates many false positives :-/ ).

 * It would help a lot if way more developers would use "Link:" tags as
explained by our documentation (e.g. use them to link to reports), as I
have to track things manually if they are missing.

I'm working on educating people and I guess over time things will improve.

Sure!

Never came in contact with it but will put "take a closer look at it" on
my list.

Yup, I'm all for such a tool (and would likely already have started one,
but I need to get regzbot to a more mature state first; and I actually
have no idea how to write a tool that ideally works locally and on the
web...).

But I consider explaining things like bisection and localmodconfig in
the documentation as also important, as that's likely something the tool
won't be able to automate any time soon (or never, as realizing that is
likely hard and better left to a separate tool anyway).
