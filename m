As I said in my response to Bjorn, s2idle is D0 from the ACPI
standpoint.  It is not a system sleep and it has no special meaning in
ACPI.

The problem seems to be related to the low-power S0 idle _DSM calls to me.

So the argument seems to be that under certain conditions the PCI
config space becomes unavailable and so _REG(dev, 0) needs to be
called when this is about to happen and _REG(dev, 1) needs to be
called when the config space becomes available again.  Fair enough,
but I'm not sure why this is limited to system suspend and resume.

Moreover, "PCI_Config operation regions on a PCI root bus containing a
_BBN object" are specifically mentioned as one of the cases when _REG
need not be evaluated at all.  I guess the operation region in
question doesn't fall into that category?

Is this about being unable to access the opregion or racing with
concurrent accesses on the OS side?

I don't think it can reasonably become mandatory without adding a
specific _OSC bit for that.

So it looks like you want to use _REG for protecting PCI config space
against concurrent accesses from AML and the OS.

And why should it be evaluated in that case?
