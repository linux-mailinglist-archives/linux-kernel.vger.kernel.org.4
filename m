Hi Rob,

This is an off the cuff response, so anything that requires me to do research
(eg because it involves stuff that I am not educated about) will be an
incomplete answer, but I don't want to delay the discussion too much in
the meantime.

Ancient history.  Using windows drivers, proprietary unix drivers, etc
in the Linux kernel.  Is that enough to make clear what I'm talking about,
or do I need to provide specific pointers?

I don't know auxiliary_bus, so my response here is iffy.  But from what

Thanks for the specific example.

Off the top of my head, I suspect ISA is a very different case.  Wasn't
ISA an example of a legacy bus that was expected to disappear?  (A long
time since I have thought about ISA.)  I'm not sure whether the powerpc
DT files with ISA devices is a good argument here or not - I would have
to look at them

No, IMHO it is most definitely not analogous to board files.

Board files were a mix of configuration information and description
of hardware that was non-discoverable.  The hardware present could
vary quite a bit between different boards within a family.  PCI
device drivers have been able to contain the information needed to
access the PCI device, and to handle variations between versions
of the board during the board's evolving life.

You are saying that this is a universal board, that will be used
different ways by different customers?

This is one of the things I've been trying to get explained (eg
why I've asked for a high level data sheet).  The use case as
presented in this patch series if for a specific PCI card that
has an SoC on it that can provide network functionality.  My
guess would be that the card has one of more physical network
connectors that make the board useful in a larger system.  The
SoC potentially has a lot of other functionality that could be
used if the proper physical connectors exist, but I don't know
because the information has not been provided. It has been
asserted that other logic blocks on the SoC need to be controlled
by other existing platform drivers - but is that because they
are needed to best use the network functionality (eg, as a
theoretical example, is some power management control desired
so the board doesn't consume excess power when the network is
idle).

Why can't there be PCI drivers for devices on the PCI board?

Why add all the complexity of doing an impedance conversion to
make a device on a PCI card look like it is on the system bus
(in other words, the driver uses the DT description and APIs
as if the device was located on a system bus instead of being
on the other side of the PCI socket)?

I consider the PCI interface to be a big deal.  Whether for an FPGA
or for an SoC on a PCI card.

The PCI socket (or cable) insulates all hardware on the PCI card from
the host system.  The PCI controller "driver" is aware of details of
the host system (eg will have to arrange for system interrupts used
to implement the PCI interrupts), but PCI drivers do not manage
those details - they deal with PCI concepts (eg PCI interrupts).

Everything I've said above may be a little cloudy and incomplete.  That
could reflect lack of knowledge on my part and/or incomplete information
about the need and the use case.  I've clearly been struggling with
trying to understand the proposal, the architecture, and the mental
model involved.  It has been asserted that I don't need to dig into
the previous rejected alternative approaches, but I suspect that not
having done so is contributing to my confusion.

If the FPGA creates and exposes non-discoverable devices on the system
busses (not behind the PCI socket boundary) then DT seems reasonable.
If overlays, then preferably static overlays that can be applied by
the bootloader before the kernel boots.  (Yes, I understand how restrictive
and unpopular that is for the FPGA community, but that also does not
negate the fact that overlay support has never been properly completed
for generic use.)

I don't want to re-debate the whole FPGA discussion. For this patch
series I have been trying to narrow the discussion to the SoC on a
PCI board issue.  I'm trying to either find a solution for the
SoC on a PCI board or not accept non-solutions for that.
