It has everything to do with it; if the other driver did the right 
thing, this change wouldn't even be here. Everything you've said has 
implied that the DMA engine driver cares about the AXI side of the 
bridge, which is represented by the platform device. Thus it should set 
the platform device's DMA mask, and use the platform device for DMA API 
calls, and thus there should be no conflict with the host controller 
driver's use of the PCI device's DMA mask to reserve a DMA address in 
PCI memory space on the other side of the bridge, nor any translation 
across the bridge itself.

Thanks,
Robin.
