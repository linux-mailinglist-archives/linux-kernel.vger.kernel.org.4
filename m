Per my understanding, this patch will avoid demoting if there's no free
space on demotion target?  If so, I think that we should trigger kswapd
reclaiming on demotion target before that.  And we can simply avoid to
fall back to reclaim firstly, then avoid to scan as an improvement as
that in your patch above.
