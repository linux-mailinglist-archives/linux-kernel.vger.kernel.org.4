Hey!

I guess here is the right place to follow up on all of this stuff...

Today at [1] we talked a bit about the various bits going on here.
I'll attempt to summarise what I remember, but I meant to do this
several hours ago and am likely to make a hames of it.

For Zbb/unaligned stuff, the sentiment was along the lines of there
needing to be a performance benefit to justify the inclusion.
Some of us have HW that is (allegedly) capable of Zbb, and, if that's the
case, will give it a go.
I think it was similar for unaligned, since there is nothing yet that
supports this behaviour, we should wait until a benefit is demonstrable.

On the subject of grouping extension/non-extension capabilities into a
single cpufeature, Palmer mentioned that GCC does something similar,
for the likes of the Ventana vendor extensions, that are unlikely to be
present in isolation.
Those are (or were?) probed as a group of extensions rather than
individually.
I think it was said it'd make sense for us to unify extensions that will
only ever appear together single psuedo cpufeature too.

For the bitfield approach versus creating pseudo cpufeatures discussion
& how to deal with that in alternatives etc, I'm a bit less sure what the
outcome was.
IIRC, nothing concrete was said about either approach, but maybe it was
implied that we should do as GCC does, only grouping things that won't
ever been seen apart.
Figuring that out seems to have been punted down the road, as the
inclusion of our only current example of this (Zbb + unaligned) is
dependant on hardware showing up that actually benefits from it.

The plan then seemed to be press ahead with this series & test the
benefits of the Zbb str* functions in Zbb capable hardware before making
a decision there.

Hopefully I wasn't too far off with that summary...

Thanks,
Conor.
