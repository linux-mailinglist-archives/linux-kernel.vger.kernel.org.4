Is this behavior different if there is a switch device forwarding on
the UR? On rk3399 switches are completely non-functional because of
the panic, which is observed in the output of the dmesg in [2] with
the hack patch enabled. Considering what you just described it looks
like the forwarded UR for each non-existent device behind the switch
is causing an serror.

Perhaps a hook mechanism that allows drivers to register with the
serror handler and offer to handle specific errors before the generic
code causes the system panic?
