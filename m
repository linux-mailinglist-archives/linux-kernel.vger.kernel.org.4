Yeah, things like this can be done from userspace but if we're gonna build
the infrastructure to allow that in gpu drivers and so on, I don't see why
we wouldn't add a generic in-kernel control layer if we can implement a
proper weight based control. We can of course also expose .max style
interface to allow userspace to do whatever they wanna do with it.

As for the specific control mechanism, yeah, charge based interface would be
more conventional and my suspicion is that transposing the current
implementation that way likely isn't too difficult. It just pushes "am I
over the limit?" decisions to the specific drivers with the core layer
telling them how much under/over budget they are. I'm curious what other gpu
driver folks think about the current RFC tho. Is at least AMD on board with
the approach?

Thanks.
