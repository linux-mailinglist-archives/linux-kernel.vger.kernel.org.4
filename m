The VF creation and configuration are also time-sensitive in some cases, 
for example, the hypervisor live update case (such as [1]):
  save VMs -> kexec -> restore VMs

After the new kernel starts, the VFs must be added into the system, and 
then assign the original VFs to the QEMU. This means we must enable all 
2K+ VFs at once and increase the downtime.

If we can enable the VFs that are used by existing VMs then restore the 
VMs and enable other unused VFs at last, the downtime would be 
significantly reduced.

Physical device. Some devices in the market support the large number of 
VFs, especially in the hardware offloading area, e.g DPU/IPU. I think 
the SR-IOV software should keep pace with times too.

I see, but maybe this change could be a choice for some users.
