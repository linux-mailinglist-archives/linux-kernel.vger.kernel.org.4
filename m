Hello Paul,

as previously discussed after Alexey's report, Thomas updated his stack
smashing code to use a volatile pointer instead of dropping compiler
optimizations. It's both cleaner and safer this way.

I verified on all supported archs that it doesn't change the behavior
and passes the test without issues, so I'm fine with it:

  125 test(s) passed.

It can be queued on top of the existing series either for the next merge
or the one after at your convenience, as I know that you're running long
and complete tests with your series, and I don't want to make you change
your tests at the last minute. This one is not urgent at all, it's more
of a maintenance improvement anyway.

Thank you!
Willy
