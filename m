Right, it is more likely a PoC in its current state.

The reason I sent it with an early state is that I want to get some
early feedback from the community ahead of the LSF/MM/BPF workshop,
then I can improve it based on these feedbacks and present it more
specifically at the workshop. Then the discussion will be more
effective.

I would like to give a short discussion on the BPF namespace if
everything goes fine.

Currently in our production environment, all the containers running
bpf programs are privileged, that is risky. So actually the goal of
the BPF namespace is to make them (or part of them) non-privileged.
But some of the abilities of these bpf programs will be lost in this
procedure, like the debug-bility with bpftool, so we need to fix it.
Agree with you that this goal is far from making bpf programs safely
running in a container environment.
