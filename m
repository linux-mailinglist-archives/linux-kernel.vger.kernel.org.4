Ahh, right you are, fair enough and thanks for hand holding and pointing
me directly at the relevant code. I now agree that the warns on the
destroyed field are just redundant.

Hmmm, ok, let me spend a bit of time trying to make all of this dynamic.
If it becomes clear that it's too much of a PITA, I might just drop the
patch; especially considering that your __rcu kptr work will address
what I was really initially trying to fix (which is that the kptr_get
pattern used in the test would likely be racy for a real kfunc). Or if
we want to, we could keep what it has now, but I could just update
delayed_destroy_test_ref_struct() to do nothing other than
WARN_ON_ONCE() and remove the extra warns for
prog_test_struct.destroyed. We can make a final call when I send out v3.

Oh, ok. So the idea is that the acquire function takes a normal trusted
pointer, and kptr_get takes an RCU protected kptr (so it would still
have to do refcount_inc_not_zero()). Makes sense.

Yeah, let's leave it off for now until we have a concrete use case in
the kernel that we want to mirror in a testcase.
