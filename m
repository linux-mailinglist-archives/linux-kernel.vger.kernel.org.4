Right.

The first LFENCE (FILL_RETURN_BUFFER) forces the CALL to retire so the
RSB stuff is guaranteed to take effect before the next unbalanced RET
can be speculatively executed.

The second LFENCE (vmx_spec_ctrl_restore_host) forces the conditional
branch to retire so the SPEC_CTRL write (potential IBRS/eIBRS
enablement) is guaranteed to take effect before the next indirect branch
and/or unbalanced RET can be speculatively executed.

So each LFENCE has a distinct purpose.  That said, there are no indirect
branches or unbalanced RETs between them.  So it should be fine to
combine them into a single LFENCE after both.

You could for example just remove the first LFENCE.  But only for that
usage site, i.e. not for other users of FILL_RETURN_BUFFER.

Or, remove them both and add an LFENCE in vmx_vmexit() right after the
call to vmx_spec_ctrl_restore_host().  That might be clearer.  Then it
could have a comment describing its dual purposes.
