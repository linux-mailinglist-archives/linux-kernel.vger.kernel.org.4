There is the known issue in marvell pcie controllers. They completely
drop the link for PCIe GEN1 cards when Target Link Speed (Link Control2)
in Root Port is configured to 5.0 GT/s or higher value and OS issues
Retrain Link (Link Control).

I think the proper way should be to workaround root of this issue by
programming Target Link Speed in Link Control2 register to required
value, instead of hacking couple of other places which are just
implication of that issue...

I can reproduce it for example with Qualcomm Atheros ath9k/ath10k wifi
cards which have another issue that they go into "broken" state when
in-band reset (e.g. pcie hot reset or pcie link down) is issues multiple
times without longer delay.

These two bugs (first in marvell pcie controller and second in wifi
card) cause that setting kernel ASPM cause disappearing card from bus
until cpu/board reset (or pcie warm reset; if board supports it at
runtime without going to POR).

I guess you are just observing result of this issue here.
