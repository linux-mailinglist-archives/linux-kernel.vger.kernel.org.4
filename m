Yes.  Or in fact if you use PASIDs inside a single function.

And I think the only reasonable answer is that the entire workflow
must be 100% managed from the controlling function, and the controlled
function is just around for a ride, with the controlling function
enabling/disabling it as needed without ever interacting with software
that directly deals with the controlled function.
