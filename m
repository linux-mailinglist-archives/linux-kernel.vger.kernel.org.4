But what do we need these annotations for? The only outcome I've ever
seen with these is that it confuses everyone.

That being said I should reserve the grouping to HK_TYPE_KERNEL_NOISE when
I'll introduce the cpuset interface. This way I can add the support for
each part smoothly. For example first patch moves HK_TYPE_TIMER to
HK_TYPE_KERNEL_NOISE and unbound timers are supported by cpuset.kernel_noise,
second patch moves HK_TYPE_WQ to HK_TYPE_KERNEL_NOISE and unbound workqueues
are supported by cpuset.kernel_noise, etc until all of them turned by nohz_full=
are supported... This is what I'm doing in fact but I'm so slow to write this patchset...

Thanks.
