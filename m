William was trying to utilize for only software cause. Setting
PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT didn't actually change the hardware behavior.
He could have as well provided just a driver private capability
flag. (see below for a more detailed problem description)

Well, the way the DMA-mask issue has been solved was a bit of the
hacky. I wouldn't call it a fully proper solution. The problem with
pointlessly allocating physical memory for the iMSI-RX engine (it
doesn't perform any DMA) and artificially restricting the coherent-DMA
mask is still there. The patch in the subject was a compromise in
order to at least permit unrestricted streaming DMAs but limiting the
coherent DMAs for the MSI setup to work properly for all peripheral
devices.

Yeah. That's another problem with the implemented approach. But are
your sure the driver had worked even before this patch? AFAICS the
driver allocated the MSI-targeted page from DMA32 zone before this
modification. So the allocation must have failed on your platform too.

The problem isn't in the value the mask is set to. The problem is
two-leveled, but is mainly connected with the PCIe device detected on
the PCIe bus. There are some of them which can't send MSI TLPs to the
64-bit addresses. Since we can't predict whether such devices exist on
the bus beforehand the LLDD probe is performed together with the
MSI-engine initialization, the solution was to just restrict the MSIs
base address to be allocated within the lowest 4GB. Moreover as I said
above the iMSI-RX engine doesn't actually cause any DMA thus there is
no need in any memory allocation. Instead reserving some PCIe-bus
space/DWORD for MSIs would be enough. Alas the PCIe-subsystem doesn't
provide a way to do so. That's why we have what you see in the driver:
DMA mask restriction and coherent DMA memory allocation.

If only we had a way to auto-detected the PCIe-bus space with no
physical memory behind it and take out a DWORD from it to initialize
the iMSI-RX engine we could have immediately got rid from the mask
setting operation and the memory allocation. It would have solved your
problem too.
