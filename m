A level of completeness can be relative to each person. For all the
years I've submitting the patches to the kernel I couldn't even
remember the last request to elaborate my logs. In no means I want to
say they were perfect. I could just be too immersed into the problem
so thought that the provided text was descriptive enough especially
for the subsystem maintainer. So to speak asking for more details
would be more than enough.

So you need more details. You should have just asked. I can't read
your mind after all. IMO the description was detailed enough to
understand the problem. Anyway as I already said the current MC
indexing approach wasn't that optimal (always relying on the low-level
driver to allocate the index) because it caused having the same IDx
allocation pattern re-implemented in the drivers. The brightest
example is the drivers with the static variable-based IDs allocation.
It doesn't seem like these drivers bother with the detected DDR
devices order. If so then the automatic IDs allocation is perfect for
them. Instead they can just pass the EDAC_AUTO_MC_NUM id to the
edac_mc_alloc() method and drop the static-based pattern. Thus getting
smaller and more readable drivers code. Moreover the variable
increment isn't atomic. Thus the ID allocation algorithm there is
prone to races should the devices probe is run concurrently.

The last but not least there is no currently way to assign the
controllers ID by means of the DTS file. The suggested patch provides
such functionality by means of the DT aliases.

If it describes the problem better I'll add the text to the patchlog
on the next patchset re-spin.

Ok. I'll drop it from the log.

IMO the function isn't that complex to add the comment there. The
semantic can be easily enough inferred from the implementation.

Once again. I didn't say it didn't work. I said it wasn't optimal.
Though in some circumstance it can misbehave for some drivers.
Please see my response above.
