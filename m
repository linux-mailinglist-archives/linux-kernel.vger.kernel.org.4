I wouldn't mind being able to turn on all the PolarFire SoC stuff and
yeah, that would be the way that arm64 does it. But I do recall hearing
that I should not turn stuff on this way, when I initially tried to
turn stuff on via selects, got a nack and asked if I could do this instead.

But it may be that I misremember, which is why I appealed to the Higher
Powers for clarification :)
