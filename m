Right, I'm just explaining why this isn't like i2c/spi and similar
subsystems. The value proposition is significantly weaker with mailbox
for this reason.

It has features we don't need that introduce bugs and complexity, while
missing features we *do* need. So yes, it's doubly a problem.

I did try to send a patch clarifying/cleaning up inconsistent usage of
the atomic codepath in other drivers, and you rejected it. At that point
I gave up in trying to contribute to cleaning up the existing mess,
because you're clearly not interested. I have some downstream fixes for
the atomic codepath and I don't think they even fix all the problems,
because we still run into issues. The design of the mailbox core is just
bizarre and makes it very hard to reason about the corner cases through
the whole queuing business.

It's a big chunk of complexity and bug-prone design and it just doesn't
make any sense for us to spend time on this if cleaning things up is
going to be an uphill battle *and* in the end the subsystem still does
nothing useful for us. It's just using the subsystem for the sake of
using it at that point. It makes no sense.

As for the other issue, there's a giant comment around the queue length

This issue is clearly known, and it doesn't take a lot of thinking to
realize that *any* queue length limit coupled with hard-fails on message
sends instead of pushback is just unsuitable for many use cases. Maybe
all existing mailbox users have intrinsically synchronous use cases that
keep the queue idle enough, or maybe they're just broken only in corner
cases that haven't come back to the mailbox subsystem yet. Either way,
as far as I'm concerned this is broken by design in the general case.

I guess it worked for them, but it's been breaking our GPU use case. So
if it's working for other people, I guess that's fine. But it's
definitely not working for us, and I'm not inclined to try to fix the
issues if nobody else has a problem.

Working on common code has the inherent risk that any changes can break
other users and I have no way to test every other mailbox user. There
are real *costs* associated with having common code, especially for
boutique things like mailbox which are highly heterogeneous and used on
all kinds of weird systems no single developer can hope to have access to.

So if you say it's working well for other people, all the more reason
for us to move away and leave them alone instead of trying to make major
changes to fix everything that isn't working for us and risk breaking
others.

As I said, we don't need nor want message queuing (yes, this is the bulk
of the complexity of the subsystem and really the source of a lot of the
pain, especially once you start throwing atomic into the mix). Other
mailbox hardware might, and that's fine. It's just not for us.
Especially not if it falls over when the queue gets full like it does.

I'm not saying the mailbox subsystem shouldn't exist, I'm saying it
might be a good idea as it stands for *some* mailbox
producers/consumers/use cases, but not *all*, and in this case, not ours.

As for the DT links, that's ~25 lines of code.

Think about it for a second. We are ceasing use of the subsystem, which
under any reasonable expectation would require us to *add* code to
duplicate functionality. Indeed there's one new small function to deal
with the OF phandle lookup. And there's also a whole new header file
with prototypes that are a facsimile of the core mailbox API too. But
overall the total LOC is down, because we more than make that up by
removing overhead caused by having to bend to the wills of the subsystem
and work around its issues (and we'd be removing even more if the
upstream driver already had the new features like runtime-PM and
workarounds for more issues).

Is that an ack? :-)
