Note that there may indeed be reads in the implementation, but most 
likely not from the srcu_read_unlock()s of other threads. Most probably 
from the synchronize_srcu() calls. So the rfe edges being added are 
probably not corresponding to any rfe edges in the implementation.

That said, I believe there may indeed not be any restrictions in 
behavior caused by this, because any code that relies on the order being 
a certain thing would need to use some other ordering mechanism, and 
that would probably restrict the behavior anyways.

It does have the negative side-effect of creating an explosion of 
permutations though, by ordering all unlocks() in a total way and also 
sometimes allowing multiple options for each lock() (e.g., 
lock();unlock() || lock();unlock()Â  has 4 executions instead of 1).

Anyways, not much to be done about it right now.

best wishes, jonas
