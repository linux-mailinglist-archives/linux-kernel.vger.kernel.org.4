That doesn't actually hide all of the behavior from users.  Let's say
they do:

	numactl --membind=6 qemu-kvm ...

In other words, take all of this guest's memory and put it on node 6.
There lots of free memory on node 6 which is TDX-*IN*compatible.  Then,
they make it a TDX guest:

	numactl --membind=6 qemu-kvm -tdx ...

What happens?  Does the kernel silently ignore the --membind=6?  Or does
it return -ENOMEM somewhere and confuse the user who has *LOTS* of free
memory on node 6.

In other words, I don't think the kernel can just enforce this
internally and hide it from userspace.

Is your memory correct?  Is there evidence, or requirements in any
specification to support your memory?
