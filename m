IMO, this indicates one of the big problems of bugzilla -- or a bug
tracker in general -- with the complete lack of screening.

An initial bug report is sent only to the bug assignees of the given
component, and those are mostly destined to persons (usually
maintainers), not to a public ML or group.  That doesn't work nor
scale for lots of bug reports.  We need screening at the first place,
before maintainers try to take a deeper look.

One may change the default target of the bugzilla assignee to a ML,
too.  However, this leads to sending lots of noises from unqualified
bug reports straightly to ML, which shall upset developers, so it's no
better choice.

And, screening is a tiresome task; you'd have to deal sometimes with
people have no clue and no etiquette.  I understand many companies
trying to deploy AI for that place...

That's a dilemma.  The kernel can't know whether it's "properly"
working, either -- that is, whether the lack of some functions matters
for you or not.  In your case above, it's about a watchdog, something
related with USB, TPM, and acceleration sensor, all of which likely
come from a buggy BIOS.  Would you mind if those features are missing?
Or even whether your device has a correct hardware implementation?
Kernel doesn't know, hence it complains as an error.

In many drivers, there are mechanisms to shut off superfluous error
messages for known devices.  So it's case-by-case solutions.

Or you can completely hide those errors at boot by a boot option
(e.g. loglevel=2).
