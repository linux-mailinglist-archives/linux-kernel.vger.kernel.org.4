Hi,

Thanks for your review.

The direct reason of this patch is that when "modprobe gpio-f7188x",
it conflicts with INT34C6. I met this issue on an older kernel, but
could not remember which version exactly.

The error message is as the link below:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.3.2/source/drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c#L798
