CONFIG_MEMCG=y is not sufficient. You would need to enable memcg
controller during the runtime as well.

Yes, it is definitely better to respect cpusets and all local memory
policies. There is no dispute there. The thing is whether this is really
worth it. How often would cpusets (or policies in general) go actively
against demotion nodes (i.e. exclude those nodes from their allowes node
mask)?

I can imagine workloads which wouldn't like to get their memory demoted
for some reason but wouldn't it be more practical to tell that
explicitly (e.g. via prctl) rather than configuring cpusets/memory
policies explicitly?

memcg is not the expensive part of the thing. You need to get from page
-> all vmas::vm_policy -> mm -> task::mempolicy
