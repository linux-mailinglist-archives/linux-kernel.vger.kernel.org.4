Tables in ACPI and UEFI tend to have magic that corresponds to their 
name, so a table called SLRT would tend to have magic that matches the 
ASCII values for that. In this case the SLRT has DRTM as its magic, 
which is a touch unexpected.

What if I don't use grub, but use something that behaves equivalently? 
Which value should be used here?

Ok.
