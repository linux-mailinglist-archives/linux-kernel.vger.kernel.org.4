FWIW I'm not sure there's really any convention. CCN seems to use 
double-underscores as distinct separators in a consistent 
CCN_REG_NAME__FIELD_NAME__SUFFIX pattern. Conversely in CMN I used it as 
an indication of the usual CMN_REG_NAME_FIELD_NAME_VALUE pattern being 
abbreviated where it would have been uncomfortably long otherwise (and 
particularly where the field name reflects the register name anyway); it 
just seemed like a good visual cue to imply that something was missing.
