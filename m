That seems off topic for me. You seems complained against the taint flag
itself.

BTW, this sounds like the BPF CI system design issue. If user is NOT easily
identifying what test caused the issue (e.g. what tests ran on the system
until the bug was found), the CI system is totally useless, because after
finding a problem, it must be investigated to solve the problem.

Without investigation, how would you usually fix the bug??

yeah, it is possible to be abused. but that is the problem who
abuse it.

Hmm, what kind of error injection does syzbot do? I would like to know
how it is used. For example, does that use only a specify set of
injection points, or use all existing points?

If the latter, I feel safer because syzbot ensures the current all
ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() functions will work with error injection. If not,
we need to consider removing the ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() from the
function which is not tested well (or add this taint flag.)

Documentation/fault-injection/fault-injection.rst has no explanation
about ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION(), but obviously the ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION()
marked functions and its caller MUST be designed safely against the
error injection. e.g.

- It must return an error code. (so EI_ETYPE_NONE must be removed)
- Caller must check the return value always.
  (but I thought this was the reason why we need this test framework...)
- It should not run any 'effective' code before checking an error.
  For example, increment counter, call other functions etc.
  (this means it can return without any side-effect)

Anything else?

This is good, but this only works when the vmcore is dumped and
on the stack. My concern about the function error injection is
that makes some side effects, which can cause a problem afterwards
(this means after unloading the bpf prog)

Ah, audit is helpful :), because we can dig the log what was loaded
before crash.
