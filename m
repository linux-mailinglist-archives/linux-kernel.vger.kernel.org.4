Thanks to your series of explanations, I learned a lot. So I can assume that
the skip of nilfs_sufile_alloc() here is because it's already been allocated. So
in next time, we will skip previous sb_segnum natually. And the problem
should not be happend.

This problem was discovered through syzbot and can be reproduced. The root
reason I think is data corruption rather than logical error. So we should add
some protection instead of modifying the logic, right?
