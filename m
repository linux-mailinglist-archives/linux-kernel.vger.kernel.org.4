Eeek, no!

You can't decrement the reference on the parent, that could cause you to
get dropped.

And you can not reuse kobjects, is that the issue here?  When you are
done with one, you have to delete it.  Then create a new one.

No need to move anything around, just destory it all and then add new
ones.

No, please don't do that.

What changed to cause problems?  the kobject reference logic hasn't
changed, was it some topology stuff?
