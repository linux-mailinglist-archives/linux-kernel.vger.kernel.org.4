Sure, I am anyway going to send v3 after rebase so I will cite the
Section 1.6 of AIA spec in the commit description.

The discovery of AIA Chapter 9 features is IOMMU specific.

The upcoming RISC-V IOMMU spec defines "capabilities" MMIO register
which has read-only bits MSI_MRIF and MSI_FLAT for discovering features
defined in AIA Chapter 9. Due to this dependency, the AIA Chapter 9 is
going to be ratified along with RISC-V IOMMU ratification.
