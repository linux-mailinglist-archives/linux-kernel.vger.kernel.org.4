Ok, so i'll describe what happens in my case. Let's NAND node be like this (IIUC this is
considered as empty NAND device):

mtd_nand: nfc@7800 {                            
	compatible = "amlogic,meson-axg-nfc";
	...
	nand@0 {                                
	       	reg = <0>;
	};
}

I see, that

1) 'mtd_otp_nvmem_add()' calls 'mtd_otp_nvmem_register()' twice for two types of
   OTP memory "user-otp" and "factory-otp". Let's take a look only on "user-otp".
2) 'mtd_otp_nvmem_register()' tries to lookup for node in 'nand@0' which is compatible with
   "user-otp" and then passes found (or not found, e.g. NULL) node to  'nvmem_register()'.
3) 'nvmem_register()' uses this node iterating over its childs and searching value "reg" in
   each child. If "user-otp" node is not found in 2), 'nvmem_register()' uses node 'nfc@7800'
   also looking for "reg" value in each of its child. In this case it found "reg" in 'nand@0'
   and fails.

Now, if i add "compatible = "user-otp";" to 'nand@0', in step 2) search will be successful,
and "reg" value will be used from this new node (or we remove "reg" from it - nothing happens
as You wrote). So, problem is that nvmem tries to parse node with invalid "reg" value.

Also I see, that 'nvmem_register()' is called earlier in 'mtd_nvmem_add()', but with no effect.
I think, that it is not related with enabled OTP feature.

Thanks, Arseniy
