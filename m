I'm probably missing something here, but why do we need to convert inline
data in page_mkwrite?  mmap() can't change i_size (stores past i_size are
discarded), so we should be able to simply copy the data from the page
cache into the inode and write the inode when it comes to writepages()
time.

Unless somebody does a truncate() or write() that expands i_size, but we
should be able to do the conversion then without the mmap_lock held.  No?
I'm not too familiar with inline data.
