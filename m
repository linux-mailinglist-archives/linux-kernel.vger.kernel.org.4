I understand why that matters from an operational perspective.

However, we are dealing with brand new code being proposed for Linux
mainline, and so this is our only chance to push back on this, as
otherwise, we will have to maintain it for a very long time.

IOW, D-RTM does not exist today in Linux, and it is up to us to define
what it will look like. From that perspective, it is downright
preposterous to even consider supporting SHA-1, given that SHA-1 by
itself gives none of the guarantees that D-RTM aims to provide. If
reducing your TCB is important enough to warrant switching to this
implementation of D-RTM, surely you can upgrade your attestation
policies as well.
