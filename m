Mostly. It's certainly better than it going entirely undetected.

Sadly we found it after rc1 because no one was really looking at
linux-next results. Something we need to improve.

But ideally it would have been found by some other CI system
whose primary job is to prevent bugs in those subsystems, rather
than the one whose primary job is to prevent bugs in gfx drivers.
Also ideally it wouldn't have been me bisecting this :P

The biggest downside of bugs reaching our CI via rc1/etc. is that
it pretty much stops everyone from getting premerge results for
their graphics driver patches since the CI keeps tripping over
the already existing bugs. But I guess you can call this one a
somewhat self inflicted wound and we should just try harder to
keep new code out of our tree until it's known to be healthy.
