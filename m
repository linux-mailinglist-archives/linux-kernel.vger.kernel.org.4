FYI, a new version was released, basing on ring-array, which brings a 6.96%
increase in throughput of 1-thread case for ARM64.

Could you share more details of the test ? I'll give it a try.

How about a private pool designate for local cpu ? If the fprobed routine
sticks to the same CPU when returning, the object allocation and reclaim
can go a quick path, that should bring same performance as shadow stack.
Otherwise the return of an object will go a slow path (slow as current
freelist or objpool).
