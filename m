At least for SMMU, we seem to be relying on pci_ats_supported() 
including pdev->untrusted in its decision - that will propagate back to 
master->ats_enabled = false inside the driver, which in turn will lead 
to arm_smmu_write_strtab_ent() leaving STE.EATS at the default setting 
which aborts all translation requests and translated transactions.

 From a quick look at the VT-d spec, it sounds like the ATSR structure 
is intended to be functionally equivalent to IORT's Root Complex "ATS 
Attribute", while the SATC is a slightly specialised version for RCiEPs. 
The spec even says "Software must enable ATS on endpoint devices behind 
a Root Port only if the Root Port is reported as supporting ATS 
transactions". It also seems to be implied that this should be based on 
what Intel themselves have validated, so an option for the user to say 
"sure, ATS works everywhere, I know better" and simply bypass all the 
existing checks doesn't really seem safe to me :/

I'd be inclined to hold the same opinion as for IORT here - if a user 
ever really does need to engage expert mode to safely work around a bad 
BIOS with known-good information, they should already have the tools to 
override the whole DMAR table as they see fit.

Thanks,
Robin.
