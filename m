No.  At least not without a lot of additional work beyond what was
presented in this patchset.  What about all of the other kobject
caches created by other LSMs, this is more than just the IMA
iint_cache.  I'm also skeptical that this patchset was ever tested and
verified as the newly added release() method was never actually called
from anywhere that I could see.

I think we would need to see a proper, verified fix before I could say
for certain.  If you want to discuss potential designs, we can do that
too, but please remember the constraints that were already mentioned
about intentionally not allowing the LSMs to be unloaded (prior to
system shutdown).

I don't know the answer to this, but I'm guessing the LSMs aren't the
only kernel subsystems to "leak" memory on system shutdown; working on
the assumption that this is the case, how are those "leaked"
allocations handled?
