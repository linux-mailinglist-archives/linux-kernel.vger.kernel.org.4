Good.  I think it's worth updating the commit log to clear this up
because there are several things with very similar names, so it's
confusing enough already ;)

Thanks, I got unreasonably focused on the "fix 'undefined reference'
error" comment, wondering if we needed to identify a Fixes: commit, so
this clears that up, too.

Only that "depends on" is much more common and I always try to avoid
unusual constructs.  But I wasn't looking into the future and
imagining several LLDDs with similar uses of "depends on DW_EDMA".
Thanks for that perspective; with it, I think it's OK either way.

It's a pretty trivial update, so I just did it myself.  The result is
at https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci.git/log/?h=pci/ctrl/dwc&id=ecadcaed4ef7

I split this patch and tweaked some commit messages for consistency
(including the "DW eDMA PCIe driver" change above).  "git diff -b"
with Lorenzo's current branch (95624672bb3e ("PCI: dwc: Add DW eDMA
engine support")) is empty except for a minor comment change.
