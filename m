I really have not seen a device that has timer starting with the epoch.

I rarely know the ISP has a wall clock timer.

Timestamp is not my first concern here. Offset is.

Yes, I didn't know any stateful codec driver support this.

Maybe we could just rename it or make a union in the existing struct.

For the compressed image, it makes sense. But the most of usage I knew 
is the upstream would just allocate a large buffer for compression video 
bitstream,

Then it could tell where the decoder should start.

That leads to another question. Should the offset be fixed from the 
first enqueued?

For the dmabuf, the v4l2 core framework would detatch then attach the 
buffer when it found the private of a plane is not same. Although it 
sounds unnecessary, some devices would a different cache line for the 
chroma channel, it should be updated.

For the drm_mode_fb_cmd2, unless you remove that fb_id, there is no way 
to modify the offset. But this would break the existing usage I 
mentioned before.

We need to consider whether we need to keep the previous offset and a 
hook for update it.

What I said didn't break that. Application would use the new ioctl() to 
contact with the existing driver.

What I want to remove is that Application use the old ioctl() to contact 
with the driver support new ioctl().

I would omit this related patches in the refresh set. We could always 
add it back. But what I want is a wayÂ  to enqueue and dequeue different 
formats(or usage) of buffers in both OUTPUT and CAPTURE. I may add a 
more complex API later.
