IIRC there is nothing currently stopping klp-convert from converting
function symbol relocations.  That may be dangerous when taking
optimizations like sibling functions (and their sharing of stack) into
consideration.  This is about the point I stopped to turn and see what
the real use cases may be.

Good observation and perhaps something that Marcos could elaborate on
(pros and cons of klp-convert in his experiments).

Yes the conversion for kpatch-build the conversion is internal, though
split in parts:

The first step is during the binary comparison program
(create-diff-object) to place all the potential klp-relocations into a
temporary .kpatch_relocations section with info like dest, type,
objname, etc.

A second program, either create-klp-module [1] or the mostly deprecated
create-kpatch-module, iterates through the intermediate
.kpatch_relocation sections and converts to klp-relocation in the final
module output.

If I understand the idea, it would be similar to the second kpatch-build
step I mentioned above -- nothing fancy, just blindly convert symbols
marked SHN_UNDEF and a given naming convention.

FWIW, it may even be possible to retrofit kpatch-build to the format for
testing -- that would offer the ability to test many real-world CVE fixups.

I think you summed it up that having an in-tree user, a test suite at
that, is a good motivation to maintain the conversion tool alongside.
Logistically it may easier to prototype and spin bugfixes faster locally
(esp. if it's supporting a quick CVE mitigation service), but hopefully
the rapid-dev/fix phase is only temporary and the normal upstream-first
development flow prevails.

I like the incremental approach of minimizing the complexity of the
conversion tool.  In fact, the hardest parts of this patchset (for me)
revolved around the kbuild integration to generate that symbols file :)
The next hardest where hypothetical problems with resolving to weird
read-only sections and then approaching compiler optimizations.
