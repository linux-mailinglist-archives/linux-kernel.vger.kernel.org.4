How exactly?

We can not break userspace when you upgrade a kernel version.

Hyper-v changes are not the issue here :)

Again, you have to support the situation where a system upgrades to a
new kernel and all the same functionality must be there.  How will you
do that if you remove drivers from a newer kernel?

Ok, that feels like overkill...

You need to also post the source for these new userspace drivers
somewhere for us to review.  I don't see a link to them in the changelog
text :(
