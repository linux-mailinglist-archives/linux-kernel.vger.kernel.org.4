No, because I don't want anyone to leave with the impression that relying o=
n the
Accessed bit to uniformly exist (or not) at all levels in the TDP MMU is so=
mehow
technically wrong.  The link you posted is about running as a Xen guest, an=
d is
in arch-agnostic code.  That is wildly different than what we are talking a=
bout
here, where the targets are strictly limited to x86-64 TDP, and the existen=
ce of
the Accessed bit is architecturally defined.

In this code, there are exactly two flavors of paging that can be in use, a=
nd
using clear_bit() to clear shadow_accessed_mask is safe for both, full stop=
.
