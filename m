This main issue is that in the case of the RMP table, a write to a 2M
mapping is interpreted as a write to a private page even if the write
didn't actually touch any private pages within the range. It may be
possible in firmware/hardware to distinguish between these 2 cases, but I'm
not sure whether that's the case for TDX or not.

Hmm, so you're suggesting doing something like moving the
kvm_unmap_gfn_range()/kvm_flush_remote_tlbs() into .update_mem_attr()
callback so the platform can decide if it needs the zap/flush rather
than handling it in generic code?

If SNP really did't need the handling it's an interesting thought, but
I think it is needed there after all...

I tested this and just doing the tlbflush is insufficient. If the
entries are still present in nested page table HV doesn't necessarily
get an #NPF so the guest can still end up with a stale mapping. After a
shared->private conversion the guest would cause #NPF with RMP/ENC bits
set once it tries to access it as a private page, but for a
private->shared conversion the guest can subsequently access the page
with ENC-bit=0 without causing an #NPF, but in this case GFN can still
be mapped to the PFN restrictedmem was using to back it when it was in
private state, instead of normal non-restricted memory.

So it seems like SNP needs the zapping behavior as well, and that it
isn't very different from the TDX/SEV-lazy/selftest users. So having
common handling seems worthwhile.

Just to be clear this is with regard to SEV lazy-pinning, which makes
used of restrictedmem mainly for lazy-pinning of private pages, rather
than SNP (which also inherits lazy-pinning from restrictedmem).

The main thing with SEV is that the private/shared status of a page is
completely up to how the guest decides to map it in its page tables,
unlike with SNP where a mismatch between guest-expected status and
actual status in the RMP table will generate a #NPF. So SEV would be
even more reliant on current zapping behavior to ensure the NPT will
be updated.

Wouldn't want to break things if a guest was running while selftest was
running, or something along that line. Especially since it seems to be a
common requirement given the above.

That's correct.

It seems like without lazy-acceptance support in the guest there isn't
too much reason to optimize here, since the guest will necessarily fault
in every page as part of pre-accepting the memory in OVMF.

And if we're making use of lazy-acceptance, for SNP at least, we wouldn't
end up getting .update_mem_attr() callbacks in the first place since
those are ultimately the result of the guest issuing a shared->private
conversion request, which would generally happen until just before the
guest decides to accept/pvalidate that GFN. So with lazy-acceptance the
guest optimizes most of this potential overhead away already.

Yes, it's an x86 instruction, no firmware calls there. Average seems to
be about 1us per instruction. It's not insignificant, up to 5s for a
16GB guest in a worst case scenario where the guest does not optimize
for 2MB shared->private conversions and has no lazy-acceptance support,
but it doesn't seem like it would be common to try to boot large guests
in such a configuration.

If it really ends up looking like an SNP-only thing, I don't see any
immediate issue with deferring this handling until fault time. But the
previous constraints remain:

 - directmap unmap needs to happen before shared->private RMPUPDATE,
   can't be called while holding KVM MMU lock or other spinlock
 - RMPUPDATE, and that needs to happen outside 
 - directmap restore needs to happen after private->shared RMPUPDATE,
   can't be called while holding KVM MMU lock or other spinlock

I saw the TDX patches added some x86 ops / hooks in KVM MMU to handle
mapping secure pages. Is there anything there you think is worth
re-using/re-purposing for SNP use-case?
