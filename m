Well, the data sheet is not particularly helpful here, which is why I
ended up with this mess.

I highly doubt there are users yet (other than my customer); this
binding+driver implementation only just landed.

That's the problem with the data sheet, it doesn't really say that the
DIN_SINK register has any effect whatsoever when the channel function is
set to something other than digital input (either flavor). Perhaps it
does hint that setting it to something non-zero is probably not a good
idea, because DIN_SINK is automatically set to 0 whenever the channel
function is set/changed, so one needs a good reason to change DIN_SINK
afterwards.

We just experimentally found out that when we added the DIN_SINK to fix
the digital input functions, when we got around to testing the
resistance measurement function that ended up broken due to the non-zero
DIN_SINK.

The data sheet doesn't say that the DIN_SINK should have any effect for
other functions, so I'm pretty sure it's only the latter: some functions
misbehave.

Yes, I do believe that it's a broken description (whether or not the
bindings specify that), and drivers don't need to go out of their way to
validate or fixup such brokenness. But in this particular case, there's
really no extra burden on the driver to not put garbage in DIN_SINK when
a not-digital-input function has been chosen (the patch is a two-liner
with 'git show -w').
