SRCU (or even RCU) polling is special in that it may rely on a concurrent updater
to start the grace period, hence why you need two more barriers here (the second
is in poll_state_synchronize_srcu()) so that:

* If the polling updater started polling (calling get_state_synchronize_srcu())
  before the traditional updater started the grace period, the latter must
  propagate the changes from the polling updater to all CPUs.

* If the polling updater started polling (calling get_state_synchronize_srcu())
  after the traditional updater started the grace period, it must wait for a
  subsequent grace period (rcu_seq_snap() will return that subsequent sequence).

* If the polling updater checks (and thereby finishes) polling (calling poll_state_synchronize_srcu())
  after the traditional updater completes the grace period, the polling updater sees
  the propagated barrier.

* If the polling updater checks polling (calling poll_state_synchronize_srcu())
  before the traditional updater completes the grace period, keep polling.

I still think rcu_seq_snap() is what you're looking for.

I'm confused, what's wrong with this ?
