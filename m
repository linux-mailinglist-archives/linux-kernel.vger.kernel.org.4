I think you missed the finish_suspend_scanning() part:

	if (root_drmcs.suspended_period_us)
		cancel_delayed_work_sync(&root_drmcs.scan_work);

So if scanning was in progress migration will wait until it finishes. 
And re-start only when migration is done (drmcs_attach), or it failed 
(drmcs_cancel_attach).

Not claiming I did not miss something because I was totally new with 
cgroup internals when I started working on this. So it is definitely 
useful to have more eyes looking.

Lets see.. __start_scanning() can be called from the worker, so max one 
instance at a time, no issue.

Then from resume scanning, so it is guaranteed worker is not running and 
can't restart since mutex guards the re-start.

Finally from drmcs_write_period_us() - yes there __start_scanning() can 
race with it being invoked by the worker - oops! However.. this is just 
a debugging aid as the cover letter explains. This file is not intended 
to be present in the final version, rather as per earlier discussion 
with Tejun the idea is to only have boot time option to control the 
functionality (enable/disable or period).

I will nevertheless try to fix this race up for the next posting to 
avoid further confusion!

Tvrtko
