It turns out there still gaps in the handling of 
task_cpu_possible_mask() in existing cpuset code. We currently do not 
check for the returned value of set_cpus_allowed_ptr() which may fails 
in case task_cpu_possible_mask() returns a different mask. I think it 
may be too late for the upcoming merge window. I am planning to have 
that addressed in the next one.

In the case of cpu offline, one possible solution may be to move the 
task to its parent like what is done for v1 when effective_cpus becomes 
empty. In the case of cpuset.cpus update, perhaps just ignore the 
failure and print an info message about that.

Cheers,
Longman
