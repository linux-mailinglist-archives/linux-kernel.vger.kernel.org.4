Awesome, thanks a lot, Eric.

I started looking into that but, to be honest, I haven't yet reached any
conclusion.  It looks like the ceph code that handles filenames *may* have
this race too (I'm looking at ceph_fill_trace()) but I'm still not 100%
sure.  In any case, I think that an eventual fix for this race (if it does
indeed exist!) will likely be restricted to the ceph code and won't touch
the generic fscrypt code.  But I'm still looking...
