We don't.  However:

While I wouldn't have put in the asynchronous support in the first place,
now that it exists, it wouldn't delete it either.

I would just keep it internal to doe.c and only expose a synchronous
API call, which does the pci_doe_task allocation internally on the
stack, uses the appropriate INIT_WORK variant and waits for completion.

Actually I was going to do just that... I'm working on the DOE code
but the ongoing patch submissions make things difficult for me
because I have to shoot at a moving target.

The simplest solution would probably just be the object_is_on_stack()
check and the second simplest would be the synchronous API call outlined
above.

Thanks,

Lukas
