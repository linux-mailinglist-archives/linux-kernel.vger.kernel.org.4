Digging back through some history:

(I am selectively pulling two fragments, see the above link for the
full email.)

Includes the following:

   A driver using this support was added and can be seen at [3]. This
   driver embeds a builtin overlay and applies it to the live tree using
   of_overlay_fdt_apply_to_node(). An interrupt driver is also included and

and

   This series was tested on a x86 kernel using CONFIG_OF under a virtual
   machine using PCI passthrough.

   Link: [1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YhQHqDJvahgriDZK@lunn.ch/t/
   Link: [2] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220408174841.34458529@fixe.home/T/
   Link: [3] https://github.com/clementleger/linux/tree/lan966x/of_support

Following link 3 to see how the driver implemented the concept, I arrived
at a git tree, with the commit be42efa "mfd: lan966x: add pci driver",
and have been looking at the code there.

Clément, is this still the best example of a driver implementation that
would use the framework proposed in the "[PATCH V7 0/3] Generate device
tree node for pci devices" patch series? And this is the driver for the
device listed as item 2 above "2) Microchip LAN9662 Ethernet Controller"?
