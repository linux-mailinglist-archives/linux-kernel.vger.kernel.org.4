Turns out according to a bisection from one of the reporters that
b006c439d58d ("hwrng: core - start hwrng kthread also for untrusted
sources") (merged for 6.1) apparently makes this hardware issue occur
quicker/more frequently a lot quicker on any board that didn't get the
firmware update yet. So it could be argued that from the point of the
kernel it *might* be considered a regression.

For details see the ticket.
