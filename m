It would be good to have more details e.g.
What file system? What block size?  What journal size?
What file size? What record size?

Is every write being sync'ed of just sync at the end?

FUA should not affect reads.  If it is, you may want to investigate how.

You do not seem to have considered data integrity.

Regular disks are assumed to provide atomic sector writes.  That is, a sector has either the old data or the new data, but not some corrupt mixture.

mmc does not have that assumption, which is presumably why Reliable Write has been used instead.  Although that idea appears to have been thrown away for devices with no cache by commit 08ebf903af57 ("mmc: core: Fixup support for writeback-cache for eMMC and SD").

File systems can use FUA to mark a successful journal flush.  Whether or not getting a torn sector at that point will corrupt the file system recovery is presumably file system specific, and maybe specific to file system options e.g. the use of checksums.

It may well be that a file system can survive a torn sector at that point, or that user space would prefer to take the risk in order to get better performance.  In either of those cases, it is not really a decision for the host controller driver.
