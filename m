I think both Michal and me are thinking of a more generic case in which the cpu
is not exclusively consumed by 1 special process, so that the draining work can
be executed during an idle time. In this case the work is basically free.

And the introduction of a spin_lock() on the hot path is what we're are concerned
about. I agree, that on some hardware platforms it won't be that expensive, but
in general not having any spinlocks is so much better.

I believe it significantly depends on the preemption model: you're right regarding
fully preemptive kernels, but with voluntary/none preemption it's exactly opposite:
the draining work will be executed at some point later (probably with 0 cost),
while the remote access from another cpu will potentially cause delays on the
spin lock as well as a need to refill the stock.

Overall I'd expect a noticeable performance regression from an introduction of
spin locks and remote draining. Maybe not on all platforms, but at least on some.
That's my main concern. And I don't think the problem we're aiming to solve here
justifies this potential regression.

Thanks!
