As previously mentioned, the libgpiod tools now support identification of
lines by name.
As long as your line names are unique at system scope you should be
good.  Otherwise you have no option but to identify by (chip,offset).

Wrt the library itself, I was thinking about relocating the line name
resolution logic from the tools into the library itself, so it would be
more generally accessible, but haven't gotten there yet.

I'm also of the opinion that libgpiod is too low level for common
tasks.  That is necessary to access all the features of the uAPI, but
for basic tasks it would be nice to have a higher level abstraction to
reduce the barrier to entry.

e.g. in Rust I can do this:

    let led0 = gpiocdev::find_named_line("LED0").unwrap();
    let req = Request::builder()
        .with_found_line(&led0)
        .as_output(Value::Active)
        .request()?;

    // change value later
    req.set_value(led0.offset, Value::Inactive)

which is the equivalent of the sysfs

echo 1 > /some/sysfs/line
...
echo 0 > /some/sysfs/line

That is bad enough. It pains me to see how complex the equivalent is using
the libgpiod v2 API (or v1), and that is not putting any shade on Bart or
anyone else who worked on it - there are a lot of constraints on how it
is designed.  It just doesn't feel complete yet, particularly from a
casual user's perspective.

One of the things I would like to see added to libgpiod is a set of working
examples of simple use cases.  Formerly the tools took double duty to
fill that role, but they've now grown too complex.
Those examples would highlight where we could provide simplified
higher level APIs.
Then rinse and repeat until the simple use cases are simple.

Well, now you mention it....

Along the same lines as Andy, it is always useful to get feedback about
problems people are facing, and how the available solutions aren't
working for them.
If we don't know the problem exists then we can't fix it - except by
accident.

Cheers,
Kent.
