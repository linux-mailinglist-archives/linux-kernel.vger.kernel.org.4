Thanks for the explanation, I agree with that.

I see that, blkg_conf_init() and blkg_conf_exit() is good, however there
are some details I want to confirm:

1) rq_qos_add() can be called from iocost/iolatency, where
blkg_conf_init() will be called first, while rq_qos_add() can also be
called from wbt, where there is no blkg_conf_init(). Hence it seems to
me we need two locks here, one to protect rq_qos apis; one to
synchronize policy configuration and device removal.

2) If you agree with 1), it seems better to use the other lock in device
level, consider that there is no need to synchronize confituration for
different devices.

Thanks,
Kuai
