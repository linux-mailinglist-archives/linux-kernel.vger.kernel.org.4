OK, but you already have that problem either way. The point of 
dma_set_mask() et al is to inform the DMA API of your device's 
capability - setting a 64-bit mask is saying "I can use 64-bit addresses 
if you can" to the DMA layer, and as I say the DMA layer is almost 
always going to respond "indeed I can, let's do that". If the real DMA 
mask is platform-specific then you need to pass a platform-specific 
value here.

It's not entirely impossible, but would require new ACPI bindings and 
code changes to the dw-pci driver, so if somebody ever did do that work 
they should be responsible for any required changes at this end as well. 
There's no point adding untested dead code now, to maintain indefinitely 
just for the theoretical possibility that someone might ever make it 
reachable.

I think you still want the DW_EDMA_CHIP_LOCAL flag, since the PCI 
endpoint device in the dw-edma-pcie case may have an of_node on some 
platforms, and in that case overriding the chan_dma_dev setup would be 
wrong. When the flag is set, though, we can simply assume dev_of_node() 
is valid since it's the only possible way for that to happen (and if 
someone does ever break that assumption in future, it will likely make 
itself noticed).

Ah, I assumed you'd still want to keep the chan_dma_dev setup for the 
sake of independent DMA masks, at least until we get a better solution 
for the MSI stuff. If you're happy with the compromise of going back to 
using the real host device to keep things simple, that's fine by me.

Thanks,
Robin.
