Yes, good idea, will do.

I definitely agree that the phrasing could be improved, but my intention
with that phrase was actually to answer the exact nuanced question you
posed. I think we need to clarify that KF_DEPRECATED is an optional tool
that developers can use to provide a softer deprecation story to their
users, rather than a flag that exists as part of a larger, strict
deprecation policy. Otherwise, I think it would be unclear to someone
reading this when and why they would need to use the flag. I liked your
suggestion below, and proposed a bit of extra text to try and capture
this point. Lmk what you think.

I like this -- are you OK with adding this in a small subsequent
paragraph to address the point I made above?

Note that KF_DEPRECATED is simply a tool that developers can choose to
use to ease their users' burden of migrating off of a kfunc. While
developers are encouraged to use KF_DEPRECATED to provide a
transitionary deprecation period to users of their kfunc, doing so is
not strictly required, and the flag does not exist as part of any larger
kfunc deprecation policy.

Agreed, I'll use "encouraged" here.

Heh, I agree that it doesn't sound right, so much so that I googled it
because of how odd it sounded in my head after repeating it a few times:
[1]. Even though it's apparently correct grammar, I'll still apply your
suggestion to v3 because I think it reads more clearly.

Fair enough. Donald said something similar in [2] as well. I'd like to
see us eventually change this paradigm over time, but we can (and
probably should) certainly decouple that from this patch.

Fair enough, will change in v3.

Thanks for all of the suggestions. I'll send out v3 later today, along
with your edits and Co-developed-by tag.
