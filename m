OBJ_RELEASE cannot be part of reg flag.
It's only in arg_type.

Anyway Kumar's refactoring was applied the code in question looks different now:
It would fall into this part:
case KF_ARG_PTR_TO_BTF_ID:
        /* Only base_type is checked, further checks are done here */
        if (reg->type != PTR_TO_BTF_ID &&
            (!reg2btf_ids[base_type(reg->type)] || type_flag(reg->type))) {
                verbose(env, "arg#%d expected pointer to btf or socket\n", i);
                return -EINVAL;
        }
        ret = process_kf_arg_ptr_to_btf_id(env, reg, ref_t, ref_tname, ref_id, meta, i);

Probably worth refining when PTR_TRUSTED is cleared.
For example adding PTR_UNTRUSTED should definitely clear it.
MEM_ALLOC flag is probably equivalent to PTR_TRUSTED.
Maybe the bit:
regs[BPF_REG_0].type = PTR_TO_BTF_ID | MEM_ALLOC;
should set PTR_TRUSTED as well?

I'm mainly objecting to logic:
!(type_flag(reg->type) & PTR_TRUSTED) || (type_flag(reg->type) & ~PTR_TRUSTED)

which looks like 'catch-all'.
Like it will error on MEM_ALLOC which probably not correct.
In other words it's 'too conservative'. Meaning it's rejecting valid code.

ok. forget the helper. open coding all conditions is probably cleaner,
since they will be different in every case.
