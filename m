I think this design is just kind of weird, specifically, the fact that
setting .core_init_notifier makes dw_pcie_ep_init() bail out early.
The usual pattern is more like "if the specific driver sets this
function pointer, the generic code calls it."

The name "dw_pcie_ep_init_complete()" is not as helpful as it could
be: it tells us something about what has happened before this point,
but it doesn't tell us anything about what dw_pcie_ep_init_complete()
*does*.

Same thing with dw_pcie_ep_init_notify() -- it doesn't tell us
anything about what the function *does*.  I see that it calls
pci_epc_init_notify(), which calls a notifier call chain (currently
always empty except for a test case).  I think pci_epc_linkup() is a
better name because it says something about what's happening: the link
is now up and we're telling somebody about it.  "pci_epc_init_notify()"
doesn't convey that.  "pci_epc_core_initialized()" might.

It looks like both qcom and tegra wait for an interrupt before calling
dw_pcie_ep_init_notify(), but I'm a little concerned because I can't
figure out what specifically they do to start the process that
ultimately generates the interrupt.  Presumably they request the IRQ
*before* starting the process, but there's not much between the
devm_request_threaded_irq() and the interrupt handler, which makes me
wonder if both are racy.
