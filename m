I think I know where the problem is. It is due to the fact the cpuset 
hotplug code doesn't update cpumasks of the tasks in the top cpuset 
(root) at all when there is a cpu offline or online event. It is 
probably because for some of the tasks in the top cpuset, especially the 
percpu kthread, changing their cpumasks can be catastrophic. The hotplug 
code does update the cpumasks of the tasks that are not in the top 
cpuset. This problem is irrespective of whether v1 or v2 is in use.

The partition code does try to update the cpumasks of the tasks in the 
top cpuset, but skip the percpu kthreads. My testing show that is 
probably OK. For safety, I agree that is better to extend the allowed 
cpu list to all the possible cpus (including offline ones) for now until 
more testings are done to find a safe way to do that. That special case 
should apply only to tasks in the top cpuset. For the rests, the current 
code should be OK and is less risky than adopting code in this patch.

Cheers,
Longman
