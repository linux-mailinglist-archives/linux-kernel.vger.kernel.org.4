The current series doesn't have the guest filtering feature enabled.
However, we implemented guest filtering and is maintained in a separate tre=
e

https://github.com/rivosinc/linux/tree/cove-integration-device-filtering

We did not include those in this series because the tdx patches are
still undergoing
development. We are planning to rebase our changes once the revised
patches are available.

This is the current approach defined in CoVE spec. Guest informs about both
shared memory & mmio regions via dedicated SBI calls (
e.g sbi_covg_[add/remove]_mmio_region and
sbi_covg_[share/unshare]_memory_region)

Yes. We don't have such a mechanism defined in CoVE yet.
Having said that, there is nothing in ISA to prevent that and it is doable.
Some specific bits in the PTE entry can also be used to encode for
shared & mmio physical memory addresses.
The TSM implementation will probably need to implement a software page
walker in that case.

Are there any performance advantages between the two approaches ?
As per my understanding, we are saving some boot time privilege
transitions & less ABIs but
adds the cost of software walk at runtime faults.

Yes. Thanks for summarizing the tdx approach.

We don't have a #VE like exception mechanism in RISC-V.

Yup. This discussion raised a very valid design aspect of the CoVE spec.
To summarize, we need to investigate whether using PTE bits instead of
additional ABI
for managing shared/confidential/ioremapped pages makes more sense.

Thanks for putting up with my answers and the feedback :).
