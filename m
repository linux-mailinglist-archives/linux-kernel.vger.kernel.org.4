This method won't work. Because the tokens in kallsyms_token_table[] have
been expanded. For example: name = "nfs_fs_proc_net_init"
kallsyms_token_table[0xf3] = "s_",  raw token = 73 5f
kallsyms_token_table[0x9f] = "fs_", raw token = 66 f3

After "s_" have been replaced with f3, there is no "fs_" substring in namebuf.
That's why I wrote a new piece of code. Due to I didn't want to add a variable
like kallsyms_token_table[].

Now, I will add kallsyms_best_token_table[], kallsyms_best_token_table_len;
kallsyms_best_token_table[] does not store tokens that contain only one
character. And index=0 is the token with the highest frequency.
