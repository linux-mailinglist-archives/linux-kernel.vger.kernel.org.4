So, this is now in rc3:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1382999aa0548a171a272ca817f6c38e797c458c

That should help avoid the worst of the issue -- laptop not sleeping.
But the race or whatever it is still does exist. So you might want to
keep this in your tracker to periodically nudge the TPM folks about it.
