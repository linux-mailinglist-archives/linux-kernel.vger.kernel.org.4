My biggest concern was connected with the 'dma-ranges' problem. The
DMA-mask thing was another issue, but since the eDMA setup is executed
after the MSI setup we can just override the mask specified by the
later procedure. Though I'll have to add some loud comment regarding
that implicit order requirement.

In anyway thanks for your fix. I'll resubmit the series with the
DMA-mask overridden in the dw_edma_probe() method. The mask will be
calculated based on an additional flag specified in the
dw_edma_chip.flags field. It seems like the best solution at this
stage.
