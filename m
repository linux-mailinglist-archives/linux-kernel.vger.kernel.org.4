It feels like there have been about half a dozen bugs pointed out in
that version of the patch.  I am going to have to sleep before I can get
as far as "Ahh"

One thing that really stands out for me is.

if (test_if_loop_should_continue) {
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
        schedule();
}

/* elsewhere */
llist_add(...);
wake_up_process()

So it is possible that the code can sleep indefinitely waiting for a
wake-up that has already come, because the order of set_current_state
and the test are in the wrong order.

Unfortunately I don't see what would effect a coredump on a process that
does not trigger the vhost_worker code.



About the only thing I can image is if io_uring is involved.  Some of
the PF_IO_WORKER code was changed, and the test
"((t->flags & (PF_USER_WORKER | PF_IO_WORKER)) != PF_USER_WORKER)"
was sprinkled around.

That is the only code outside of vhost specific code that was changed.


Is io_uring involved in the cases that hang?
