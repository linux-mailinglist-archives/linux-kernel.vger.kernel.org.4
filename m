Good point. The "secondary_ctls" may be inaccurate, but I do not
have a better name in mind either...

Adding nested_vmx_setup_secondary_ctls() will impact
1> your previous patch to expose ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE control
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20221213062306.667649-2-seanjc@google.com/
2> my previous patch to simplify the setting of secondary proc-
based control:

How about we combine our previous patches and the new ones together
in next version?

One more questionable comment for nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs() is:

As to the misc data msr, do we really need a seperate function for it?
If yes, then what about the vmx basic msr, the ones for fixed bits in
CR0/4?
