The motivation was giving user space more flexibility to design their
policies. However, as you point out, the current behavior of falling
back to reclaiming when we cannot demote is not ideal, and maybe we
should not design policies around it. We can always revisit this if a
use case arises where a clear distinction needs to be drawn between
reclaiming and demotion policies.
