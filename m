I remain confused.

[RFC 00/10] add support for fwnode in i2c mux system and sfp
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YhQHqDJvahgriDZK@lunn.ch/t/

  references a PCIe driver:
  [2] https://github.com/clementleger/linux/blob/fwnode_support/drivers/mfd/lan966x_pci_mfd.c

So there is a PCIe driver that works.

However, the RFC patch series was proposing adding fwnode support to the driver.  My first
surface reading (just part of that one email, not the entire series or the replies yet),
notes:

  ... However, when
  plugged in a PCIe slot (on a x86), there is no device-tree support and
  the peripherals that are present must be described in some other way.

I am assuming that the peripherals are what you mentioned above as '"platform"
devices'.  This is where my current confusion lies.  Are the "platform"
devices accessed via the PCI bus or is there some other electrical connection
between the host system and the PCIe card?

If the "platform" devices are accessed via the PCI bus, then I would expect them
to be described by PCI configuration header registers.  Are the PCI configuration
registers to describe the "platform" devices not present?

I'll read through the fwnode RFC thread to add to see what happened to the proposal.
