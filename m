[beginning of thread is
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230511131441.45704-1-ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com;
context here is that several drivers clear ASPM config directly,
probably because pci_disable_link_state() doesn't always do it]

Yeah, I noticed that this is problematic.

We went round and round about this ten years ago [1], which resulted
in https://git.kernel.org/linus/2add0ec14c25 ("PCI/ASPM: Warn when
driver asks to disable ASPM, but we can't do it").

I'm not 100% convinced by that anymore.  It's true that if firmware
retains control of the PCIe capability, the OS is technically not
allowed to write to it, and it's conceivable that even a locked OS
update could collide with some SMI or something that also writes to
it.

I can certainly imagine that firmware might know that *enabling* ASPM
might break because of signal integrity issues or something.  It seems
less likely that *disabling* ASPM would break something, but Rafael [2]
and Matthew [3] rightly pointed out that there is some risk.

But the current situation, where pci_disable_link_state() does nothing
if CONFIG_PCIEASPM is unset or if _OSC says firmware owns it, leads to
drivers doing it directly anyway.  I'm not sure that's better than
making pci_disable_link_state() work 100% of the time, regardless of
CONFIG_PCIEASPM and _OSC.  At least then the PCI core would know
what's going on.
