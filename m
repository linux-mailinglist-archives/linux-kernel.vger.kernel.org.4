What is the role of memcg then? If the memory limit is in place and the
workload doesn't fit in then it will get reclaimed during start up and
memory would need to be refaulted if not mlocked. If it is mlocked then
the limit cannot be enforced and the start up would likely fail as a
result of the memcg oom killer.

An alternative requires to make the current implementation that is
lockless to use locks and introduce potential lock contention. This
could be harmful to regular workloads. Not using pcp caching would make
a fast path using few atomics rather than local pcp update. That is not
a terrible cost to pay for special cased workloads which use isolcpus.
Really we are not talking about a massive cost to be payed. At least
nobody has shown that in any numbers.

What kind of role would memcg play here? Do you want to memory constrain
that workload?
