The whole reason we're doing hwprobe with bitmaps is beacuse the ISA 
strings are not a stable interface, and thus are not suitable for 
building uABI around.

Extension that do introduce new user-mode state are usually disabled by default and have to be enabled by S mode or M mode (e.g. FS[1:0] for the floating-point extension). So there should not be a reason to filter any extensions that are unknown.
