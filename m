Thanks! I am glad you agree it may have some value -- please see below

I haven't said otherwise -- as I said, I think it would be nice to
have this be part of the kernel itself. :)

Yeah, I would imagine so.

I considered that -- for things like Rust, it could make sense, but
perhaps somebody is already using `K:` to match files they do care
about, rather than `F:`. So we would need to ask others, but I think
it is fine.

Yes, at least for Rust, modulo omissions, we match files explicitly
with `F:`. We have a couple unimportant omissions, e.g.
`.rustfmt.toml`, but I can send a patch.

Personally, I have always seen `F:` files (and `N:`-matched ones) as
having more weight than `K:`-matched ones, i.e. I saw `K:` as more of
a "it depends on what it matches -- discretion needed".

From a quick look, most `K:`-using subsystems seem to list `F:` and
`N:` as I would expect.

> It's also reasonable to apply K: to patches.

Yes, definitely, for Rust, that is our main use case, i.e. it is
mainly why we wanted to have the `K:` entry: to catch changes to
things that are tagged with "Rust" in C files (early on, at least).

It is particularly important for us, since we are also considering
having more of these annotations in the future.

For Rust, yes, that would probably work for us. Not sure for all
subsystems using `K:`, though.

Having said that, I suggested including the kernel config too in this
decision (i.e. not for the patches case, but for testers finding
runtime issues), because it adds information: it leaves reports out
when something is not even enabled but matched via `K:`, but still
allows a Cc when matched via `K:` and enabled. It is, of course, still
potentially a false positive, but some subsystems may want to hear
about those.

For instance, for Rust, this would be fine early on, since we don't
expect many to have `RUST=3Dy` to begin with, and thus the odd false
positive report via `K:` is fine. Later on, this heuristic may change,
and we may not change those matches anymore (especially since, by
then, the goal is that subsystems would be taking care of their own
Rust bits).

This is what I was suggesting to then put in `get_maintainer.pl`, e.g.
a `--bot` option (or `--runtime`, or `--config-based-filtering`, or
similar) option. Then the bots can add that option on their side.

Thanks again for considering this!

Cheers,
Miguel
