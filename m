This is a poor fit for invalidate_range_{start,end}().  All other uses bookend
the primary MMU update, i.e. call start() _before_ changing PTEs.  The comments
are somewhat stale as they talk only about "unmapped", but the contract between
the primary MMU and the secondary MMU is otherwise quite clear on when the primary
MMU will invoke start() and end().

	 * invalidate_range_start() is called when all pages in the
	 * range are still mapped and have at least a refcount of one.
	 *
	 * invalidate_range_end() is called when all pages in the
	 * range have been unmapped and the pages have been freed by
	 * the VM.

I'm also confused as to how this actually fixes ARM's SMMU.  Unless I'm looking
at the wrong SMMU implementation, the SMMU implemenents only invalidate_range(),
not the start()/end() variants.

	static const struct mmu_notifier_ops arm_smmu_mmu_notifier_ops = {
		.invalidate_range	= arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range,
		.release		= arm_smmu_mm_release,
		.free_notifier		= arm_smmu_mmu_notifier_free,
	};

Again from include/linux/mmu_notifier.h, not implementing the start()/end() hooks
is perfectly valid.  And AFAICT, the existing invalidate_range() hook is pretty
much a perfect fit for what you want to achieve.

	 * If invalidate_range() is used to manage a non-CPU TLB with
	 * shared page-tables, it not necessary to implement the
	 * invalidate_range_start()/end() notifiers, as
	 * invalidate_range() already catches the points in time when an
	 * external TLB range needs to be flushed. For more in depth
	 * discussion on this see Documentation/mm/mmu_notifier.rst

Even worse, this change may silently regress performance for secondary MMUs that
haven't yet taken advantage of the event type, e.g. KVM will zap all of KVM's PTEs
in response to the upgrade, instead of waiting until the guest actually tries to
utilize the new protections.
