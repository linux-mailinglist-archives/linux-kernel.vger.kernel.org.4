These two commits are applied for three years, I don't check the details
yet but they seem can't guarantee that no io will be handled by
rq_qos_throttle() after pd_offline_fn(), because I just reproduced this
in another problem:

f02be9002c48 ("block, bfq: fix null pointer dereference in bfq_bio_bfqg()")

User thread can issue async io, and io can be throttled by
blk-throttle(not writeback), then user thread can exit and cgroup can be
removed before such io is dispatched to rq_qos_throttle.

Currently I'm sure such IOs can come from blk-throttle, and I'm not sure
yet but I also suspect io_uring can do this.
