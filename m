The IORT flags are not this kind of policy, they are a necessary 
description of the hardware. The mix-and-match nature of licensable IP 
means that just because an SMMU supports the ATS-relevant features 
defined by the SMMU architecture, that doesn't say that whatever PCIe IP 
the customer has chosen to pair it with also supports ATS. Even when 
both ends nominally support it, it's still possible to integrate them 
together in ways where ATS wouldn't be functional.

In general, if a feature is marked as unsupported in IORT, the only way 
to "relax" that would be if you have a silicon fab handy. If any system 
vendor *was* to misuse IORT to impose arbitrary and unwelcome usage 
policy on their customers, then those customers should demand a firmware 
update (or at least use their own patched IORT, which is pretty trivial 
with the kernel's existing ACPI table override mechanism).

Thanks,
Robin.
