CPU or not doesn't matter. We also track system errata.

Keying it off a DT compatible (or something similar) would work.

In the absence of a detection mechanism for anything past the CPU,
this is a moot point. At this stage, this is a bit like saying
"writing to memory is a system thing, not only a CPU feature".

And this also breaks KVM if these CPUs don't have FWB, as a guest can
always map a piece of memory as non-cacheable, and trigger the issue
you describe in your reply to Will, even if you hide the atomics on
the host.
