I agree. On a SRIOV setup, the host typically owns the PF and assigns
VFs to the guests. Devices must be enlightened to guarantee that once
one of their VFs/interfaces is passed to a trusted VM, it can no longer
be modified by anything untrusted (e.g. the hypervisor).

On confidential computing platforms where a security manager (e.g.
Intel TDX module) manages the confidential guests, the IDE key
management and stream settings would be handled by this manager. In
other words, the SPDM requester would not be a Linux kernel.
FWIW, Intel recently published an interesting description of TEE-IO
enabling with TDX [1].

Right, I was not concerned by the challenge messages integrity but by
trusting the host with verifying the response and validating the device
cert chains.

Yes, the host can DoS the guest at anytime it wants and in multiple
ways. It's definitely out of the confidential computing thread model at
least.
