I agree that KVM should not provide its own policy but only the building 
blocks to enforce one. There is two complementary points:
- policy definition by the guest, provided to KVM and the host;
- policy enforcement by KVM and the host.

A potential extension of this framework could be to enable the host to 
define it's own policy for guests, but this would be a different threat 
model.

To avoid too much latency because of the host being involved in policy 
enforcement, I'd like to explore an asynchronous approach that would 
especially fit well for dynamic restrictions.
