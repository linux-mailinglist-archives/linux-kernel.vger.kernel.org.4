I would love to see that happen, too, and that could be a reason to
put pci-conf.h in include/linux.  But this series doesn't include
that.

drivers/pci/pci.h

Of course not, I didn't suggest or expect that.  What I'm trying to
point out is that I don't think we have very good reasons for
pci-ecam.h to be public.  And therefore, I don't think we need
pci-conf1.h to be next to it.

Unless you want to convert the arch/x86 code to use them as well.  I'm
not asking you to do that either, just that if you *did* do that, it
would be an argument for keeping the macros where you put them.
