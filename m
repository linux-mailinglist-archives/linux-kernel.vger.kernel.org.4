Unnecessary VERWs in guest will have much higher impact than due to MSR
read/write at vmentry/exit. On an Icelake system it is pointless for a
guest to incur VERW penalty when the system is not affected by MDS/TAA and
guests don't need mitigation for MMIO Stale Data. MSR writes are only
done when the guest is likely to execute unnecessary VERWs(e.g. when the
guest thinks its running on an older gen CPU).

Vulnerability applies to MMIO access to devices that don't respect "byte
enable" (which indicates valid bytes in a transaction), and don't error
on incorrect read or write size.

I will get back on this. The guest would typically need access to an
area that doesn't fail an incorrectly sized MMIO.

Is it likely that KVM will not do VERW when affected by MMIO Stale Data?
If you mean on a hardware that is not vulnerable to MDS and MMIO Stale
Data, in that case MSR writes are unnecessary and will be skipped
because FB_CLEAR_DIS is not available on unaffected hardware.

I will be happy to avoid the MSR read/write, but its worth considering
that this MSR can receive more bits that host may want to toggle, then
percpu cache implementation would likely change.

Would the MSR value be same on every CPU, if only some guests have
enumerated FB_CLEAR and others haven't? MSR writes (to disable FB_CLEAR)
are not done when a guest enumerates FB_CLEAR. Enumeration of FB_CLEAR
in guest will depend on its configuration.

The current implementation allows guests to have VERW flush buffers when
they enumerate FB_CLEAR. It only restricts the flush behavior when the
guest is trying to mitigate against a vulnerability(like MDS) on a
hardware that is not affected. I guess its common for guests to be
running with older gen configuration on a newer hardware.

Thats true.
