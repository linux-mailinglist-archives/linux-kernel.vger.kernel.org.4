Right.

Could you explain why is the "depends on" operator more preferable
than if/endif? In this case since we have a single core kconfig from
which all the eDMA LLDD config(s) (except PCIE_DW for the reason
previously described) will surely depend on, using if/endif would
cause the possible new eDMA-capable LLDD(s) adding their kconfig
entries within the if-endif clause without need to copy the same
"depends on DW_EDMA" pattern over and over. That seems to look a bit
more maintainable than the alternative you suggest. Do you think
otherwise?

No, you aren't.

What you described was the second option I had in mind for the update
to look like, but after all I decided to take a shorter path and
combine the modifications into a single patch. If you think that
splitting it up would make the update looking simpler then I'll do as
you suggest. But in that case Lorenzo will need to re-merge the
updated patchset v10.
