OK. Tested again and it is working-ish...

Then stops here doing the 1024001 B case. The host waits for a completion that
does not come. On the EP side, I see:

[   94.307215] pci_epf_test pci_epf_test.0: READ src addr 0xffd00000, 1024001 B
[   94.307960] pci_epc fd000000.pcie-ep: Map region 1 phys addr 0xfa100000 to

                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The DMA engine does not like something at all. Back to where I was when I tried
your series initially, which is why I tried removing patch 1 to see what happens...

[  132.370479] pci_epf_test pci_epf_test.0: READ => Size: 1024001 B, DMA: YES,
Time: 38.059623935 s, Rate: 26 KB/s
[  132.372152] pci_epc fd000000.pcie-ep: Unmap region 1
[  132.372780] pci_epf_test pci_epf_test.0: RAISE MSI IRQ 1
[  132.373312] rockchip-pcie-ep fd000000.pcie-ep: Send MSI IRQ 1

[  132.374388] pci_epf_test pci_epf_test.0: Raise IRQ failed -22

And it looks like the PCI core crashed or something because MSI does not work
anymore as well (note that this is wheat I see with my nvme epf driver too, but
I do not have that DMA channel reset message...)

If I run the tests without DMA (mmio only), everything seems fine:

## Read Tests (No DMA)
READ (      1 bytes):		OKAY
READ (   1024 bytes):		OKAY
READ (   1025 bytes):		OKAY
READ (1024000 bytes):		OKAY
READ (1024001 bytes):		OKAY

## Write Tests (No DMA)
WRITE (      1 bytes):		OKAY
WRITE (   1024 bytes):		OKAY
WRITE (   1025 bytes):		OKAY
WRITE (1024000 bytes):		OKAY
WRITE (1024001 bytes):		OKAY

## Copy Tests (No DMA)
COPY (      1 bytes):		OKAY
COPY (   1024 bytes):		OKAY
COPY (   1025 bytes):		OKAY
COPY (1024000 bytes):		OKAY
COPY (1024001 bytes):		OKAY

So it looks like translation is working with your patch, but that the driver is
still missing something for DMA to work correctly...

Will keep digging.

Note that this is all tested with the patch series fixing pci-epf-test and
pci_endpoint_test drivers that I posted earlier today. As mentioned, my host is
an AMD Ryzen PC.
