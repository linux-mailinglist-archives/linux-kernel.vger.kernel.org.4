It can't.  That's the whole point.  The controlled function that is
being migrate must be absolutely unaware of that (except for things
like quiescing access or FLRs that could happen anyway), because
otherwise your have a fundamental information leak.

No, it can't.  It must be in charge.

Yes, it is as I've pointed out multiple times.  But, that relationship
is only visible to the primary controller.  It also doesn't help with
the general problem where the secondary controller must be able to
completely change it's identify and thus the subsystem.

Yes, that's your case, and probably a very common one.  But also far from
the only one, so there is no way Linux or the specification can rely
on that dumb fact.  Never mind that there are virtualization schemes
(look at the s390 code) where the PF to VF relationship gets lost.
