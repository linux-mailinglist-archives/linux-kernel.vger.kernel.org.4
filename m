 After an SBR the link goes down, but the situation is actually somewhat 
more complex than you describe.

 Mind that the Target Link Speed field in the Link Control 2 register is 
sticky.  Consequently if the link goes down with TLS set to 2.5GT/s then 
it comes back up just fine, because it's still clamped at 2.5GT/s after 
reset.  The U-Boot workaround takes advantage of this observation and 
leaves TLS at 2.5GT/s.  This way if an OS is booted that is unaware of 
this erratum and resets the PCI/e hierarchy then U-Boot's workaround 
remains in action and the link resumes operation.

 Now when TLS is reset back to 5GT/s or higher, then the link goes down 
and starts its infinite training dance again.  This happens when TLS has 
been reset by hand in U-boot and Linux is booted and resets the PCI/e 
hierarchy in the course (but then our quirk chimes in), or under running 
Linux with this change applied when an SBR is issued via `setpci' or by a 
modified kernel that has the `dev->subordinate' condition removed.

 Right.  That's what the debug messages I have observed indicated as well.  

 For the record, I made an experiment and with the `dev->subordinate'
condition removed I reset device 05:00.0 in my system via:

# echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:05\:00.0/reset

 With the TLS reset back to its 8GT/s default here the link did not come 
back up as expected and consequently no device from this bus subhierarchy 
was accessible anymore:

	!!! Unknown header type 7f

Retraining by hand and then rescanning brought the subhierarchy back:

# setpci -s 02\:03.0 CAP_EXP+0x30.W=0061; setpci -s 02\:03.0 CAP_EXP+0x10.W=0020; sleep 1; setpci -s 02\:03.0 CAP_EXP+0x30.W=0063; setpci -s 02\:03.0 CAP_EXP+0x10.W=0020

(though bridge BARs aren't exactly correct anymore).

 With the TLS clamped at 2.5GT/s the link did come back up and the bus 
subhierarchy remained accessible except for a downstream conventional PCI 
bus:

 The conditions I came up with for the detection of a failed link 
negotiation are supposed to tell this situation apart from an absent 
endpoint on the other end of a link.

 Indeed in the system affected there is the 02:00.0 downstream port device 
within the same ASM2824 switch that is not connected to anything (no slot 
there or an onboard device; essentially just a wasted x2 downstream port 
the board designers could not come up with a use for) and the quirk just 
does not trigger for it, because the conditions it checks are not met for 
an unconnected link.  Specifically the Link Bandwidth Management Status 
bit in the Link Status register cannot be set to 1 for an unconnected 
link, because setting the bit requires a link to hold the DL_Up status and 
that does not happen when there is no component on the other side of the 
link.  That's at least my understanding.

 I have no immediate way to verify other ports, because I am away from my 
lab now and the system has its PCI/e hierarchy otherwise fully occupied, 
but the behaviour was consistent as I made extensive verification earlier 
on.

 The same condition is used by the U-Boot workaround BTW.

 At this point in my understanding of the situation I tend to agree.  
This will guarantee that device resets issued under our control will do 
the right thing (we can't do anything I suppose about requests issued by 
`setpci' behind our back) and is also what the U-Boot workaround I have 
come up with does.  I'll make v6 along these lines.

 Thank you for your inquisitiveness and the review.
