So there is often confusion over the CRB interface. If you ask an ARM 
person, they will describe a door-bell, general purpose memory interface 
that has no support for locality. That interface is described in the 
TCG's Mobile TPM interface. Though there is work in progress to address 
this. Now if you speak with an x86 person, they will describe a 
state-based command-response mechanism using MMIO registers which has 
locality support. That interface is described in the TCG PC Client 
specification.

As to whether there are devices with CRB and TXT. I have seen talk on 
the tboot mailing list that there exist an Intel client devices that has 
an Intel-PTT fTPM using the PC Client CRB interface and Intel-TXT. I 
myself have never seen one, so I could not point you at a SKU/Part No. 
for such a device. If someone has such a device and willing to help, 
drop me a line and I would be glad to work with them to get this tested.

v/r,
dps
