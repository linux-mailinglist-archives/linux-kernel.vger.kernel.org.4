I agree "walk all PCI devices looking for one we like" approach is terrible
in general. And I am glad to modify my code to adapt to a more suitable solution
when it comes.

For now, I will collect comments from v3 and v4 and send a new version after
addressed them. Any alternative option is welcomed, always :)
