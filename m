That still feels wrong, why is PCI involved here at all?

Don't abuse platform devices like this please, mock up a platform device
framework instead if you want to test them that way, don't think that
adding a platform device "below" a PCI device is somehow allowed at all.

Again, you can not have a platform device below a PCI device, that's not
what a platform device is for at all.

The aux bus can support any type of bus (it's there to be used as you
want, it's just that people are currently using it for PCI devices right
now).

Then make a new bus type and again, do not abuse platform devices.

Again, nope, a platform device is NOT ever a child of a PCI device.
That's just not how PCI works at all.

Would you do the attempt to do this for USB?  (hint, no.)  So why is PCI
somehow special here?
