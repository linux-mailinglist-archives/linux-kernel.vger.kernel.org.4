I am back from vacation, and I have completed the other devicetree
related tasks that were also at the top of my devicetree todo list.

I will resume the detailed reading of the series as the item that is
now at the top of my devicetree todo list.  But I consider any review
comments coming out of this as trivial compared to the issue raised in
the following paragraph:

Since there was no reply to the above paragraph, I am guessing that what
I wrote was not clear enough.  As far as I am concerned, this issue is
critical.  This patch series creates a body of code that is _more fragile_
and _more incomplete_ than the existing overlay code.  I have been very
clear over many years that the overlay code is not usable in its current
implementation.

Further, the body of code in this patch series will interact with the
overlay code in a manner that makes the overlay code even more fragile
and not usable.
