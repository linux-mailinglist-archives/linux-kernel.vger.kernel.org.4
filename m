So, could you then propose a solution how to fix this issue to allow one
interrupt to be shared with more devices, like it is needed for some
Armada platforms? Because I do not see a way how to do it without
IRQF_SHARED and without shared interrupt it is not possible to implement
any other pending features.

I'm feeling that since May there is just conclusion that all development
on the mvebu must be stopped as more people here do not like this
hardware and trying to do remove it or at least make it orphan.
