I would have found out that the Microchip LAN9662 Ethernet Controller is
_not_ just an ethernet controller (as I was assuming), but is instead also
contains ARM64 cores.  (Actually I am sure that I had noted that an SoC
was involved, but lost track of that info when trying to wrap my head
around this patch series.)

Even this information does not explain where the ethernet controller is
located and how it is accessed.  My most likely guess without looking at
chip specification is that the ethernet controller interfaces to the
processor bus and/or an IOMMU is probably involved.  What is very unclear
to me is the interconnection between the card PCI connector (which will be
plugged into the host system where we are running Linux for this patch
series).  This will feed into my misunderstanding below.

For future versions of this patch series, please include the info that the
LAN9662 Ethernet Controller is an SoC, as was noted in the above link.

I had been assuming that each device that is visible via the PCI connector
had a set of PCI configuration header registers that
provided the information required to use that device.

The above paragraph reinforced my understanding, saying "so it's totally
standard PCI stuff".  (Apparently my understanding was wrong, see further
below...)

Clément had further replied (this seems to have gotten lost in Rob's reply to me:

   In the case of the lan9662 cnetwork controller, BAR 0 and 1 exposes
   multiples devices that are located at some subranges of this BAR. For
   instance (not accurate), we have the I2C controller located at BAR 0
   + offset 0X1000, then the flexcom controller exposed in BAR 0 at offset
     0x20000, etc. This list of peripheral is not exposed at all by the PCI
   configuration headers (since it is not the purpose of course). All of
   these peripherals have already existing platform drivers which can then
   be reused thanks to the PCI device-tree overlay series.

At this point my understanding (or misunderstanding as we will see below)
remains intact, with the slight addition that the devices on the PCI card
are multi-function.  I've never worked with multi-function devices on a
PCI card so I don't know how they are supposed to be described, but this
new information seems reasonable.

The (vendor/product) would provide the information to find a driver
that understands that this PCI device contains both the I2C controller
and the flexcom controller.

The phrase "This list of peripheral is not exposed at all by the PCI
configuration headers" is confusing to me.  A major function of the
configuration headers it to list exactly what devices are available on
the card, as identified by (vendor/product) in each configuration
header.  The (vendor/product) "exposes" the multi-function device,
also known as "the list of peripheral".

That is a PCI device problem, not a non-discoverable device on the
system non-discoverable busses.  PCI devices are supposed to be
discoverable on the PCI bus.

This series claimed to be about (1) a method to "describe hardware devices
that are present in a PCI endpoint" and (2) "allows reuse of a OF
compatible driver".

(1) is normally implemented directly in a PCI driver

(2) is using a shim to make a single driver able to access a device that
is either directly on the system bus (the driver "native" environment)
or located on a PCI card (in other words on the other side of the PCI
bus interface on the PCI card).

"Putting an SoC behind a PCI BAR" is not different to me than any
other device on a PCI card.  And I do not _even_ know what it means
to put an SoC behind a PCI BAR (there are many ways that could be
implemented), which is why I was asking Clément questions, trying
to understand the problem space.

PCI devices are more than a BAR, there is a set of PCI Configuration
Header Registers to provide the requisite information to locate the
proper driver for the device and provides the dynamic information
specific to the device in this card (eg address ranges, interrupt
info, MSI, MSI-X, etc).  The driver is expected to contain all
further knowledge about how to control the device.

This is a clue for me:

I had been assuming that each SoC supplied device that is visible via
the PCI connector had a set of PCI Configuration Header Registers that
provided the information required to use that device.

I think this is where my misunderstanding jumps out.

Please correct and explain as necessary anything in the block the
I write here:

The clue above appears to say that one portion of "SoC IO memories" are
exposed through BAR 0 and a second portion of "SoC IO memories" are
exposed through BAR 1.

This would be consistent with Rob's description saying the entire
SoC is exposed by a single Configuration Header Register set.

Caveat: I've never worked with an IOMMU on ARM64 (only on other very
different architectures) so I have no clue as to what the specific
ARM64 IOMMU architecture is or any related nuances.

I don't know what "SoC IO memories" are.  But given the context of a
driver accessing addresses, I am guessing these are addresses in the
context of the processor bus.  The precise description probably does
not matter if I can simply assume they are addresses the driver will
use, and the addresses are properly mapped into the addresses listed
in the BARs.

Frank's assumption: the relevant devices, such as the ethernet controller
are located directly on the SoC processor bus (is the proper term "memory
bus"? - addresses that are accessed via SoC load and store instructions).

So are the entire set of SoC processor bus addresses mapped via the BARs?
Or even a significant subset?

Further Frank's assumptions: Some sort of firmware is running on the SoC
that is on the PCI card that does things like control clocks, do power
management, set up the interrupts from devices to be visible via the PCI
connector, as described by the PCI Configuration Header Registers (possibly
including the MSI and/or MSI-X registers), any IOMMU setup if needed, etc.
The host system that the PCI card is plugged into is insulated from that
set of activities by the PCI interface.  <----- This assumption may turn
out to be wrong, as I ask more questions further below.

This makes me guess that the assumption I made above in this email
is not correct.  This seems to be saying that the host system needs
to understand related devices in the card's SoC, and possibly control
them.  An example of this could be that the PCI Configuration Header
Register do _not_ describe the interrupt information for e.g. the
ethernet controller, and maybe the host system needs to understand
and/or program an interrupt controller in the card's SoC.  Is this
conceptually correct (that is maybe not this specific hardware, but
a similar concept)?

The devices _are_ discoverable.  The PCI Configuration Header Register
(vendor/product) says what the devices are.

To me this implies that (as an example, using the ethernet controller)
the host system will be configuring the resources and/or infrastructure
on the SoC that is used by the ethernet controller.

Do I understand that correctly?

My previous expectation is the the ethernet controller driver on the
host system would only be touching registers mapped to the ethernet
controller driver to do things like send commands, read status results,
specify buffer addresses that would map back to flow through the PCI
connector, etc.

I can't really respond to this section and below because I still do
not understand the specific problem space of the SoC on the PCI card.

Hopefully your response to this email will move me further along
the path to properly understand the PCI card implementation.
