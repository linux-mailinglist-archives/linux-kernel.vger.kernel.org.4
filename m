This pops on ATOMIC_SLEEP, thanks for pointing this out. I missed that
the gup retry statement is a fallthrough. PROVE_RCU/LOCKING didn't catch
this, lesson learned.

Ok, guess I'm looking for what best to do here that is least likely to
break and also allows potentially the BPF program to grab further user
memory within it (I guess this means using sleepable BPF, should I
follow what uprobes did?).

This is how I wired up libbpf via libbpf-bootstrap for the sample that's
checked in:
struct example {
    unsigned long long unused;
    int count;
};

SEC("tp/user_events/test")
int handle_tp(struct example *ctx)
{
        int pid = bpf_get_current_pid_tgid() >> 32;

        bpf_printk("BPF triggered from PID %d, count=%d.\n", pid, ctx->count);

        return 0;
}

I'm not sure if tp is referencing traditional tracepoint or not
(guessing it is).

We use both, depending on the situation. Local debugging we typically
use ftrace since it's quite easy to use. In production we use perf_event
buffers mainly.

See above, asking for guidance.

Good to know, do you recommend then how uprobes did this? These are in
user context via write()/writev(). I don't see why I wouldn't pick
sleepable / faultable if it offers better options to folks.

Happy to.

It sounds like I should look into sleepable BPF, which I will do, but
I'll wait to get you advice on this before sending a patch, etc.
