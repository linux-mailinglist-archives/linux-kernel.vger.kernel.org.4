Right.  Though, thinking about it more, this isn't even needed.  Each
klp_shadow would have a pointer to its owning module.  We already have a
global hash of klp_shadows which can be iterated when the module gets
unloaded or replaced.

Assuming atomic replace, the new patch is almost always a superset of
the old patch.  We can optimize for that case.

If the new patch needs to remove any old shadow variables, it can do so
in its post-patch callback.

Non-replace patches would still be supported.  Just with the restriction
that garbage-collected shadow variables are by definition owned by a
single patch module and thus can't be shared across patch modules.
