I do agree with Roman here. It is _always_ good to mention whether this
is a tool/review or actual bug triggered fix. Also {READ,WRITE}_ONCE doesn't
guarantee atomicity so it would be good to rephrase the changelog.
Something like:
The knob for cgroup v2 memory controller: memory.oom.group
is not protected by any locking so it can be modified while it is used.
This is not an actual problem because races are unlikely (the knob is
usually configured long before any workloads hits actual memcg oom)
but it is better to use READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE to prevent compiler from
doing anything funky.

This patch is not fixing any actual user visible bug but it is in line
of a standard practice.
