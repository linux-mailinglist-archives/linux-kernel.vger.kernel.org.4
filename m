Patches 1-3 don't fix anything - these are just refactoring to make the code simplier.

This particular patch is done to enable the refactoring in the next patch by removing an
(hopefully broken) outlier.


Patch 4 is small fix in the sense that it allows the warning from the current cpuid filtering code
to be seen (it is supressed in early code, but then it doesn't usually happen again, so no warning
is printed at all)

Patch 5 is the main fix - it  makes the kernel to be tolerant to a broken CPUID config 
(coming hopefully from hypervisor),
where you have a feature (AVX2 in my case) but not a feature on which this feature depends (AVX).

Aha! I was reading the 'do_initcalls()' code and thought that it
goes over all initcalls.

note that it turns out that this function is called 'do_pre_smp_initcalls()'.

This needs the arch lbrs which aren't yet supported by KVM (there are patches
on the mailing list), plus I need a hardware which supportes them, of which
I don't know even if intel released any yet.

I can hack the code/KVM though to simulate enough of it to see if this failback
happens.

Besides that, anything else I should do to to see that patch series merged?

Thanks,
