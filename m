Wrong conclusion. You have (or should have) devicetree node(s) such as

         sata: sata@80000 {
                 compatible = "marvell,orion-sata";
                 reg = <0x80000 0x5000>;
                 interrupts = <21>;
                 clocks = <&gate_clk 14>, <&gate_clk 15>;
                 clock-names = "0", "1";
                 phys = <&sata_phy0>, <&sata_phy1>;
                 phy-names = "port0", "port1";
                 status = "disabled";
         };

Those nodes should have devices associated with them (in this case instantiated
by drivers/ata/sata_mv.c). At the same time, the drivetemp driver callback
(drivetemp_add) gets called with a device pointer as parameter. The question
is how to get from the device pointer passed to drivetemp_add() to the device
created by the sata_mv driver. Is it dev ? or dev->parent ? Or dev->parent->parent ?
The devicetree node associated with that device is the one which should be used
to set the hwmon device devicetree node. Essentially you'll have to find out where
in the device list to find the of_node pointing to the above sata node. Then we
can discuss how to make that node available to the thermal subsystem.
