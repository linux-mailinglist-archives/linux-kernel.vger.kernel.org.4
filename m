In that case I'd suggest: I forward any I see to you, but don't add them
 to the regressions tracked with regzbot.

Does that sound fine for you? Or is there a strong reason why I should
track them? Then they would be in the weekly reports to Linus, but I
wonder if he cares. At least for now now I guess he does not -- at some
later point where of the problems that are still hiding surfaced and
were fixed it might be something different. But then I could start
tracking them.

Great!
