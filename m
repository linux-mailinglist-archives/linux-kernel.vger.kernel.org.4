How about allowing both keyCertSign and digitalSignature asserted but
issuing a warning for this case?

Here's my rationale for this proposal.

I assume we should conform to some X.509 specifications. So I checked
"RFC 5280: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [1] and ITU-T X.509 (2012-10)
[2].

[1] states in 4.2.1.3. Key Usage,
    "If the keyUsage extension is present, then the subject public key
    MUST NOT be used to verify signatures on certificates or CRLs unless
    the corresponding keyCertSign or cRLSign bit is set.  If the subject
    public key is only to be used for verifying signatures on
    certificates and/or CRLs, then the digitalSignature and
    nonRepudiation bits SHOULD NOT be set.  However, the digitalSignature
    and/or nonRepudiation bits MAY be set in addition to the keyCertSign
    and/or cRLSign bits if the subject public key is to be used to verify
    signatures on certificates and/or CRLs as well as other objects."

and [2] states in 8.2.2.3 Key usage extension that,
   "More than one bit may be set in an instance of the keyUsage extension.
   The setting of multiple bits shall not change the meaning of each
   individual bit but shall indicate that the certificate may be used for
   all of the purposes indicated by the set bits. There may be risks
   incurred when setting multiple bits. A review of those risks is
   documented in Annex I."

I interpret the above texts as we should allow both keyCertSign and
digitalSignature. However [2] warns about the risks of setting multiple
bits. Quoting Annex I,

   "Combining the contentCommitment bit in the keyUsage certificate
   extension with other keyUsage bits may have security implications
   depending on the security environment in which the certificate is to be
   used. If the subject's environment can be fully controlled and trusted,
   then there are no specific security implications. For example, in cases
   where the subject is fully confident about exactly which data is signed
   or cases where the subject is fully confident about the security
   characteristics of the authentication protocol being used. If the
   subject's environment is not fully controlled or not fully trusted, then
   unintentional signing of commitments is possible. Examples include the
   use of badly formed authentication exchanges and the use of a rogue
   software component. If untrusted environments are used by a subject,
   these security implications can be limited through use of the following
   measures:   
    – to not combine the contentCommitment key usage setting in
      certificates with any other key usage setting and to use the
      corresponding private key only with this certificate;   
      
    – to limit the use of private keys associated with certificates that
      have the contentCommitment key usage bit set, to environments which
      are considered adequately controlled and trustworthy"

So maybe it's useful to add a warning if both keyCertSign and
digitalSignature are asserted.
