I believe those instructions are for development only. I'll get them
changed to a more secure approach. We don't want to folks leaving it
wide open.

We should tell folks to use a group and give access to the group like
Steven said earlier.

The delete IOCTL is different than reg/unreg. I don't see a problem with
adding a CAP_SYSADMIN check on the delete IOCTL (and other delete paths)
to prevent this. It shouldn't affect anything we are doing to add this
and it makes it so non-admins cannot delete any events if they are given
write access to the user_events_data file.
