By convention, doc toctree have 2-level depth (only page title and
first-level headings are visible). You may consider adding

> +
> +IOMMU Configuration
> +-------------------
> +
> +When doing a Secure Launch, the IOMMU should always be enabled and the d=
rivers
> +loaded. However, IOMMU passthrough mode should never be used. This leave=
s the
> +MLE completely exposed to DMA after the PMR's [2]_ are disabled. The cur=
rent default
> +mode is to use IOMMU in lazy translated mode but strict translated mode =
is the preferred
> +IOMMU mode and this should be selected in the build configuration::
> +
> +  "Device Drivers" -->
> +      "IOMMU Hardware Support" -->
> +          "IOMMU default domain type" -->
> +              "(X) Translated - Strict"
> +
> +In addition, the Intel IOMMU should be on by default. The following sets=
 this as the
> +default in the build configuration::
> +
> +  "Device Drivers" -->
> +      "IOMMU Hardware Support" -->

y for

t of an

will
> +configure that kernel to execute (command line, boot params, etc). Then =
storing

 launch
> +implementations leverage the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to store those
> +measurements. The TPM itself has been designed such that a dynamic launch
> +unlocks a specific set of Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) for hol=
ding
> +measurement taken during the dynamic launch.  These are referred to as t=
he DRTM
> +PCRs, PCRs 17-22. Further details on this process can be found in the
> +documentation for the GETSEC instruction provided by Intel's TXT and the=
 SKINIT

gies

> +=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
> +
> +A number of design decisions were made during the development of the Sec=
ure
> +Launch feature. The two primary guiding decisions were:
> +
> + - Keeping the Secure Launch code as separate from the rest of the kernel
> +   as possible.
> + - Modifying the existing boot path of the kernel as little as possible.
> +
> +The following illustrate how the implementation followed these design
> +decisions:
> +
> + - All the entry point code necessary to properly configure the system p=
ost
> +   launch is found in st_stub.S in the compressed kernel image. This code
> +   validates the state of the system, restores necessary system operating
> +   configurations and properly handles post launch CPU states.
> + - After the sl_stub.S is complete, it jumps directly to the unmodified
> +   startup_32 kernel entry point.
> + - A single call is made to a function sl_main() prior to the main kernel
> +   decompression step. This code performs further validation and takes t=
he
> +   needed DRTM measurements.
> + - After the call to sl_main(), the main kernel is decompressed and boot=
s as
> +   it normally would.
> + - Final setup for the Secure Launch kernel is done in a separate Secure
> +   Launch module that is loaded via a late initcall. This code is respon=
sible
> +   for extending the measurements taken earlier into the TPM DRTM PCRs a=
nd
> +   setting up the securityfs interface to allow access the TPM event log=
 and
> +   public TXT registers.
> + - On the reboot and kexec paths, calls are made to a function to finali=
ze the
> +   state of the Secure Launch kernel.
> +
> +The one place where Secure Launch code is mixed directly in with kernel =
code is
> +in the SMP boot code. This is due to the unique state that the dynamic l=
aunch
> +leaves the APs in. On Intel this involves using a method other than the
> +standard INIT-SIPI sequence.
> +
> +A final note is that originally the extending of the PCRs was completed =
in the
> +Secure Launch stub when the measurements were taken. An alternative solu=
tion
> +had to be implemented due to the TPM maintainers objecting to the PCR
> +extensions being done with a minimal interface to the TPM that was an
> +independent implementation of the mainline kernel driver. Since the main=
line
> +driver relies heavily on kernel interfaces not available in the compress=
ed
> +kernel, it was not possible to reuse the mainline TPM driver. This resul=
ted in
> +the decision to move the extension operations to the Secure Launch modul=
e in
> +the mainline kernel where the TPM driver would be available.
