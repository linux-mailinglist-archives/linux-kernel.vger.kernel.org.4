I agree its low-effort, but I think the result is not worth having.

What does user-space get when it reads 'mbm_total_bytes'? Returning an error here sucks.
How is user-space supposed to identify the groups it wants to monitor, and those it
doesn't care about?

Taking "the only way to win is not to play" means the MPAM driver will only offer those
'mbm_total_bytes' files if they are going to work in the same way they do today. (as you
said, on Intel and AMD the resources are simply always available).

I agree those files have always been able to return errors - but I've never managed to
make the Intel system I have do it... so I bet user-space doesn't expect errors here.
(let alone persistent errors)


My fix for those systems that don't have enough monitors is to expose the counters via
perf, which lets user-space say which groups it wants to monitor (and when!). To make it
easier to use I've done it so the perf stuff works on Intel and AMD too.

Really? Depending on the order groups are created in is a terrible user-space interface!
If someone needing to be monitored comes along later, you have do delete the existing
groups ... wait for limbo to do its thing ... then re-create them in some new order.

Not correctly supporting resctrl (the mbm_total_files exist, but persistently return an
error) means some user-space users of this thing are broken on those systems.
Adding extra knobs to indicate when the underlying monitor hardware needs to be allocated
is in practice going to be missing if its only needed for MPAM, and is most likely to
bit-rot as codebases that do use it don't regularly test it.


This patch to allow resctrl_arch_rmid_read() to sleep is about MPAM's CSU NRDY and the
high likelyhood that folk build systems where MSCs are sliced up and private to something
smaller than the resctrl:domain. Without the perf support, this would still be necessary.

The changes needed for perf support are to make resctrl_arch_rmid_read() re-entrant, and
for the domain list to be protected by RCU. Neither of these are as onerous as changes to
the user-space interface, and the associated risk of breaking programs that work on other
platforms.


Thanks,

James
