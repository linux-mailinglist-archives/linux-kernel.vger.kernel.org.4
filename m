Jason/Christoph,

As I mentioned earlier we have 2 orthogonal paths here: implementation 
and SPEC. They are for some reason mixed in this discussion.

I've tried to understand some SPEC related issues that were raised here, 
that if we fix them - the implementation will be possible and all the 
VFIO efforts we did can be re-used.

In high level I think that for the SPEC:

1. Need to define a concept of a "virtual subsystem". A primary 
controller will be able to create a virtual subsystem. Inside this 
subsystem the primary controller will be the master ("the controlling") 
of the migration process. It will also be able to add secondary 
controllers to this virtual subsystem and assign "virtual controller ID" 
to it.
something like:
- nvme virtual_subsys_create --dev=/dev/nvme1 --virtual_nqn="my_v_nqn_1" 
--dev_vcid = 1
- nvme virtual_subsys_add --dev=/dev/nvme1 --virtual_nqn="my_v_nqn_1" 
--secondary_dev=/dev/nvme2 --secondary_dev_vcid=20

2. Now the primary controller have a list of ctrls inside it's virtual 
subsystem for migration. It has handle to it that doesn't go away after 
binding the controlled function to VFIO.

3. Same virtual subsystem should be created in the destination hypervisor.

4. Now, migration process starts using the VFIO uAPI - we will get to a 
point that VFIO driver of the controlled function needs to ask the 
controlling function to send admin commands to manage the migration process.
     How to do it ? implementation detail. We can set a pointer in 
pci_dev/dev structures or we can ask 
nvme_migration_handle_get(controlled_function) or NVMe can expose API's 
dedicated to migration nvme_state_save(controlled_function).


When creating a virtual subsystem and adding controllers to it, we can 
control any leakage or narrow some functionality that make migration 
impossible. This can be using more admin commands for example.
After the migration process is over, one can remove the secondary 
controller from the virtual subsystem and re-use it.

WDYT ?
