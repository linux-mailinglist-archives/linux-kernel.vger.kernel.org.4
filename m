I meant this as the first patch:

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221027150925.248421571@goodmis.org/

Which was what the link above was suppose to point to.

It's the only patch relevant to the rest of the series, as the rest is just
converting over to the shutdown API, and the last patch changes
DEBUG_OBJECTS_TIMERS to catch if this was done properly.

That is, patch 01/31 and the patch you were Cc'd on is relevant, and for
those that want to look deeper, see patch 31 as well.

But if I included the Cc list for patch 01 for all those Cc'd in the
entire series, it would be a huge Cc list, so I avoided doing so.

Also, this is still RFC as the changes may still change. That is, this
patch set is a heads up to what is to come. Ideally, I'd like to get just
the API possibly in the kernel before the merge window without anyone using
it. Then I can ask all the sub systems to pull in these individual patches
as well.
