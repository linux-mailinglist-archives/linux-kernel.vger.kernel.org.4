A lot of distros set the 'quiet' option to _keep_ the kernel from
spewing messages at boot.  Ubuntu sets "quiet splash", for instance.

Going into the grub menu and killing the 'quiet' and replacing it with
'debug' is a good place to start.  earlyprintk=vga can also help if
things are still blank at that point.  I thought we used to have an
earlyprintk=efi, but it seems to have vanished at some point.

But, you've got a bit of oddball hardware.  It's from the _far_ extreme
end of 32-bit-only hardware.  The fact that it had Windows on it isn't a
great sign.  There could be a BIOS bug that trips Linux up but Windows
is perfectly happy with.  There was definitely a sad period of time
where folks were not interested in fixing issues like that.
