It shows up as around 90% L2 time, 10% L1 time. I don't have great visibility into L0 time
right now, I'm trying to find someone who might be able to help with that.

I can run perf, what trace would help?

This shows the same problematic behavior (tested commit 0d3eb744aed40ffce820cded61d7eac515199165).

Same here (tested kvm-x86-next-2023.04.10)

The results are the same for both branches, and it does look like this affects AMD and
Intel equally.

So seeing as this will likely take a while to figure out (and I know I won't be able to
spend too many cycles on this in the next few weeks), what do you think of a patch to
disable tdp_mmu in this configuration (for the time being?).

Something else I've been wondering: in a KVM-on-KVM setup, is tdp_mmu used in both L0
and L1 hypervisors right now?
