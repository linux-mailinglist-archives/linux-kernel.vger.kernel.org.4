No, that is not practical (for example, see the never ending patches
to address broken refcounting -- of_node_get() and of_node_put() usage).
Plus the overlay data in the system device tree is visible to every
driver and subsystem, not just the limited set that appear to be
related to the nodes in the overlay.

What tree is that in?  And what sections of that file?
