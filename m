This code is also updated by Lukas' patch at
https://lore.kernel.org/r/bd6ac49d60c1ca6fe5c27c2fa54b78d70a8ba07b.1672511017.git.lukas@wunner.de,
which is pretty much ready to go.

Can you take a look at that series and see whether it solves the same
problem you're solving here?  And if not, can you provide feedback on
what would still be needed?

If you do need something on top of Lukas' series, please CC him if you
post a revised patch.

Bjorn
