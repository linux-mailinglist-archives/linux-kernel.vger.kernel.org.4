Thanks for the clarification, that fits my understanding.

"Calculated in target mode" and "correct total count" are architectural choices,
which is not a problem if the consumers of PMU data are on the same side.

But for a VM user, seeing SYSRET in the user mode is completely and functionally
different from seeing VMRUN in the guest context. Since the host user and
the guest user are two separate pmu data consumers, and they do not aggregate
or share the so-called "total" PMU data.

This situation is even worse for nested SVM guests and SEV-SNP guests.

I'm not urging that AMD hardware should change, but it is entirely necessary
for our software layer to take this step, as it is part of the hypervisor's 
responsibility
to hide itself by default.
