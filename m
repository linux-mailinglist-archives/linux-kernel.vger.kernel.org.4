I remember I didn't change the compatible to panel-edp because it didn't
work at that time, but it does now... I'm not sure what actually fixed that
and if the commit(s) was/were backported to that suggested point, so I
would leave the Fixes tag out, as that may break older kernels.

Anyway, for this commit:
