My understanding of mem-stat and cpu-stat is that they are independent 
of each other. In theory, reading one shouldn't affect the performance 
of reading the others. Since you are doing mem-stat and cpu-stat reading 
repetitively in a loop, it is likely that all the data are in the cache 
most of the time resulting in very fast processing time. If it happens 
that the specific memory location of mem-stat and cpu-stat data are such 
that reading one will cause the other data to be flushed out of the 
cache and have to be re-read from memory again, you could see 
significant performance regression.

It is one of the possible causes, but I may be wrong.

Cheers,
Longman
