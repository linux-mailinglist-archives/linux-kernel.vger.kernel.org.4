L1 can do whatever it wants.  E.g. L1 could passthrough its APIC to L2, in which
case, yes, L1 will map its APIC base into L2.  KVM (as L0) however doesn't support
mapping the APIC-access page into L2.  KVM *could* support utilizing APICv to
accelerate L2 when L1 has done a full APIC passthrough, but AFAIK no one has
requested such support.  Functionally, an APIC passthrough setup for L1=>L2 will
work, but KVM will trap and emulate APIC accesses from L2 instead of utilizing
hardware acceleration.

More commonly, L1 will use APICv for L2 and thus have an APIC-access page for L2,
and KVM will map _that_ page into L2.

As above, KVM never maps the APIC-access page that KVM (as L0) manages into L2.

Pages from vmcs12 that are referenced by physical address in the VMCS are pinned
(where "pinned" means KVM holds a reference to the page) by kvm_vcpu_map().  I.e.
the page will not be migrated, and if userspace unmaps the page, userspace might
break its VM, but that's true for any guest memory that userspace unexpectedly
unmaps, and there won't be any no use-after-free issues.
