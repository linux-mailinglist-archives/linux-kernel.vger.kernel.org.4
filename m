If we can get a subset of threadedirqs (call it threadedsoftirqs) from
PREEMPT_RT where softirqs can be converted into RT kthreads, that'll alleviate
both sides of the problem IMO. But last I checked with Thomas this won't be
possible. But things might have changed since then..

There's a netdev_budget and netdev_bugdet_usecs params in procfs that control
how long the NET_RX spends in the softirq. Maybe you need to tweak those too.
In your case, you probably want to increase the budget.

Note that in Android the BLOCK layer seems to cause similar problems which
don't have these NET facilities. So NET is only one side of the problem.
