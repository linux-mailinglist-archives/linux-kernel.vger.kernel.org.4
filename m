I'm trying to understand why we need a new kernel concept for all
this. It looks like we are just creating a poor man's
publisher/subscriber solution in the kernel, but mostly intend to use
it from user-space? Why not just use Unix domain sockets for this,
though? Use SOCK_SEQPACKET, put "event data" into a single packet
that's guaranteed to not be broken up. Expose this to other processes
through named pipes, if necessary.

Sorry if it's naive questions, but it's not clear what problem
user_events are solving and why we need a new thing and can't use
existing kernel primitives?
