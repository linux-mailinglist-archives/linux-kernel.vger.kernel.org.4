Specify the kernel option here.  These last two sentences should
probably be a separate paragraph because they say specifically what
this patch does.

I think I would split the Xilinx Alveo U50 quirk to a separate patch
from the infrastructure and make this patch more generic.

PCI/PCIe

Actually, in this context (and in the commit log), you should just say
"PCI" because there's nothing PCIe-specific here.

Follow the style of the file, which is "capitalize English sentences."
