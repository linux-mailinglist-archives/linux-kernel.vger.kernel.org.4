You mean the gpio driver is calling nvmem_register()? Yeah I agree, that
should work.

You mean F8/F9? That will work as they are for different GPIOs. What
doesn't work with gpio-regmap is when you need to modify two different
registers for one GPIO. Have a look at gpio_regmap_get() and
gpio_regmap_set(). If the default gpio_regmap_simple_xlate() doesn't 
work
you can use your own .xlate() op.

That is a pity, because that is the whole use case for this gpio 
expander,
no? "Programmable Replacement for Mechanical Jumpers and Switches"
