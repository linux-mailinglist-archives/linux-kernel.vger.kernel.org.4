Oh, I think I see where you're coming from.  The fact that we have a
VF pointer means VFs were enabled in the past, and as long as the PF
is still present, the VFs should still be enabled.

Since the continued existence of the VF device depends on VF Enable, I
guess my question is whether we need to worry about VF Enable being
cleared, e.g., via sysfs reset or a buggy PF driver.

Taking a step back, I don't understand the
"if (!pci_device_is_present()) virtio_break_device()" strategy because
checking for device presence is always unreliable.  I assume the
consumer of vq->broken, e.g., virtnet_send_command(), would see a
failed PCI read that probably returns ~0 data.  Could it not check for
that and then figure out whether that's valid data or an error
indication?

It looks like today, virtnet_send_command() might sit in that "while"
loop calling virtqueue_get_buf() repeatedly until virtio_pci_remove()
notices the device is gone and marks it broken.  Something must be
failing in virtqueue_get_buf() in that interval between the device
disappearing and virtio_pci_remove() noticing it.
