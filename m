It is true that it is difficult to guarantee those delays. On our internal
boards, we are able to achieve this but that is not with linux kernel.

With NVMe attach we have connected the protocol analyzer and tried to see if
there are any transactions over the link. We found there are no transactions
on the link once the link enters L1.x till we resume the system. As the NVMe
is a passive system it is not initiating any transactions.

This whole requirement came from the NVMe driver, it requires keeping 
the link
active state when the system is suspended.

There are only two things we can in do in PCIe suspend as we have to 
turn off
PCIe clocks to allow the system to the lowest possible power state.
1) Keep the device in D3 cold and turn off all the clocks and phy etc.( 
It is not
an ideal one as this decreases the NVMe lifetime because link-down and 
link-up
is treated as a power cycle by a few NVMe devices).
2) This is the one we are proposing where we turn off the clocks, phy 
once the
link enters L1ss.

Can you please suggest us any other possible solutions to meet NVMe 
requirement
(That is to keep the link active during suspend) and the Qcom platform
requirement (that is to turn off all the clocks to allow a lower possible
power state)? Qcom PCIe controller is compatible with v3.1 specification 
only.
