My preference for function parameter passing is we don't need do the
atomic reading when we want to check va->flags. However, in va->flags
setting side, atomic_set() code is simpler than function parameter.

	flags = atomic_read(&va->flags);
        if (flags & VMAP_RAM) {
		
	}

I checked code, and feel it doesn't have much difference, so keep the
current code. If there's other thing I didn't think of, we can still
change. Thanks.
