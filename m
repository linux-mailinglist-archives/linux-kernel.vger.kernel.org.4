My question as well. However, that's only for Vincent's usecase. The
other ones I'm aware of are definitely non-discoverable MMIO devices
behind a PCI device.

It is perfectly valid in DT to have the same device either directly on
an MMIO bus or behind some other MMIO capable bus. So what bus type
should they all be?

How about of_platform_bus[1]?

At this point, it would be easier to create a new bus type for
whatever it is you think *should* be a platform device and move those
to the new bus leaving platform_bus as the DT/ACPI devices bus.

Actually, yes. It is limited since USB cannot tunnel MMIO accesses
(though I suppose USB4 PCIe tunneling can?), but we do have some
platform drivers which don't do MMIO.

Suppose I have an FTDI chip with GPIOs on it and I want to do GPIO
LEDs, keys, bitbanged I2C, etc. Those would use the leds-gpio,
gpio-keys, i2c-gpio platform drivers.
