This is somewhat similar to what I'm saying in another thread:

  https://lore.kernel.org/live-patching/20230415043949.7y4tvshe26zday3e@treble/

If objtool and DWARF/SFrame agree, all is well.

The dynamic reliable stacktrace checks for CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER on x86
are much simpler, as they don't require ORC or any other metadata.  They
just need to detect preemption and page faults on the stack, and to
identify the end of the stack.  Those simple dynamic checks, combined
with objtool's build-time frame pointer validation, worked very well
until we switched to ORC.

So I'm not sure I see the benefit of the additional complexity involved
in cross-checking frame pointers with ORC at runtime.  But I'm just a
bystander.  What really matters is what the arm64 folks think ;-)
