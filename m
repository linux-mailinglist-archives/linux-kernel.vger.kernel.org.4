No, recent compilers are absolutely forbidden from doing this sort of
thing except under very special circumstances.

Before C11, compilers could and in fact did do things like this.  This is
after all a great way to keep the CPU's vector unit from getting bored.
Unfortunately for those who prize optimization above all else, doing
this can introduce data races, for example:

	char a;
	char b;
	spin_lock la;
	spin_lock lb;

	void change_a(char new_a)
	{
		spin_lock(&la);
		a = new_a;
		spin_unlock(&la);
	}

	void change_b(char new_b)
	{
		spin_lock(&lb);
		b = new_b;
		spin_unlock(&lb);
	}

If the compiler "optimized" that "a = new_a" so as to produce a non-atomic
read-modify-write sequence, it would be introducing a data race.
And since C11, the compiler is absolutely forbidden from introducing
data races.  So, again, no, the compiler cannot invent writes to
variables.

What are those very special circumstances?

1.	The other variables were going to be written to anyway, and
	none of the writes was non-volatile and there was no ordering
	directive between any of those writes.

2.	The other variables are dead, as in there are no subsequent
	reads from them anywhere in the program.  Of course in that case,
	there is no need to read the prior values of those variables.

3.	All accesses to all of the variables are visible to the compiler,
	and the compiler can prove that there are no concurrent accesses
	to any of them.  For example, all of the variables are on-stack
	variables whose addresses are never taken.

Does that help, or am I misunderstanding the question?

							Thanx, Paul
