I do worry about how many cases will be reported once 6.4 is released,
and this eventually makes its way into distributions. In either case
the dmi table will need to be maintained. The UPX-11i case is a
different issue, and IIRC the L490 it needed a DMI entry, because
trying to catch the irq storm wasn't solving the issue there. I
imagine other odd cases will be popping up as well.

So far we have 2 irq storm reports with peterz's P360 Tiny, and I
guess that Inspur system reported by the kernel test robot. Then there
is whatever is going on with Peter Ujfalusi's UPX-11i.

Just to make sure I have it clear in my head, you mean when the
average is shorter than the threshold duration between interrupts,
yes? My brain wants to read 'When the average goes beyond threshold'
as 'threshold < average'.

Does the check need to be a rolling window like 1/2 currently has? I
expect that if the problem exists it will be noticed in the first
window checked. I think what I originally tried was to check over some
interval from when the handler first ran, disable interrupts if
needed, and then skip the check from then on when the handler ran.

Jerry
