The patch was about dropping the ranges, not about adding EXPERT. So on
arm64 it was added because Catalin requested it, other arch maintainers
didn't.

Why the default MAX_ORDER was not acceptable on arm64 server machines but
it is fine on, say, x86 and s390? 
I'm not asking how you made it possible in Fedora and RHEL, I'm asking why
did you switch from the default order at all.
