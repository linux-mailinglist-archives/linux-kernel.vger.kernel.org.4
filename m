There are legimate scenarios where a kernel might want to disable the APIC on
select CPUs, e.g. to offline SMT siblings in BIOS.  Whether or not doing that in
a VM makes sense is debatable, but we really have no way of knowing if there are
existing guests that selectively disable APICs.

Heh, "just" a perf regression.  Inhibiting APICv would definitely be a perf regression
that people care about, e.g. see the very recent bug fixes:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221116205123.18737-1-gedwards@ddn.com
https://lore.kernel.org/all/1669984574-32692-1-git-send-email-yuanzhaoxiong@baidu.com

Conceptually, I like the idea of inhibiting the APICv memslot if a vCPU has its
APIC hardware disabled.  But practically speaking, because KVM has allowed that
scenario for years, I don't think we should introduce such an inhibit and risk
regressing guests.

I have no objection to fine tuning this in follow-up, but for this bug fix I'd
much prefer to go with this minimal change.  The nested SVM TLB flushing issue
extends far beyond this one case, i.e. needs a non-trivial overhaul and an audit
of pretty every piece of SVM code that can interact with TLBs.
