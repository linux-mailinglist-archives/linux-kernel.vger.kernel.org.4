Good idea, will take a look at that after finishing v3 patch, and possibly
make a separate patch for it. (This is my first time contributing, better keep 
it simple).

Sure, will add them in v3! About json output, they are currently not touched
to avoid breaking scripts. I will add inner_map_id as a new field in v3 like the 
following patch.
