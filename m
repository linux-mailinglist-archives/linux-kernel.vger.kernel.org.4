Sorry if that wasn't clear. Loading a bpf program from the kernel is
fine and safe. But it was the use of it that wasn't.

In my case, HID-BPF to fix devices is safe (whether the program is
loaded from the kernel or from userspace): the bpf JIT/verifier
ensures that there are no out of bound read/write and the API is
properly defined. But the problem I am facing with the generic bpf
implementation is that it is made to be a global processing and to
attach to one given function, when I wanted to have a couple function
+ device.

So in this patch, I actually abused BPF to get free event
notifications when the bpf program was released.
The first implementation (HID: initial BPF implementation) was safer
than this patch because I was using BPF for notifications of my
internals but I wasn't messing up with the reference count. So if I
did not get the events, I wouldn't decrement the bpf_prog and the end
result means that the bpf program would stay forever attached to the
device. Not user friendly but it doesn't introduce a kernel crash.

However, this patch is messing with reference counting of an internal
kernel object assuming I would always get the event. This is not the
case and so I get read after free errors.

TL;DR: (ab)using BPF internally for kernel introspection to manage
kernel structures is just plain wrong. Mea culpa.

Cheers,
Benjamin
