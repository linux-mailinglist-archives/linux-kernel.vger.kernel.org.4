Forcing HLT doesn't solve anything, it's perfectly legal to passthrough HLT.  I
guarantee there are use cases that passthrough HLT but _not_ MONITOR/MWAIT, and
that passthrough all of them.

Pinning isn't strictly required from a safety perspective.  The latency of context
switching may suffer due to wake times, but preempting a vCPU that it's C1 (or
deeper) won't cause functional problems.   Passing through an entire socket
(or whatever scope triggers extra fun) might be a different story, but pinning
isn't strictly required.

That said, I 100% agree that this is expected behavior and not a bug.  Letting the
guest execute MWAIT or HLT means the host won't have perfect visibility into guest
activity state.

Oversubscribing a pCPU and exposing MWAIT and/or HLT to vCPUs is generally not done
precisely because the guest will always appear busy without extra effort on the
host.  E.g. KVM requires an explicit opt-in from userspace to expose MWAIT and/or
HLT.

If someone really wants to effeciently oversubscribe pCPUs and passthrough MWAIT,
then their best option is probably to have a paravirt interface so that the guest
can tell the host its offlining a vCPU.  Barring that the host could inspect the
guest when preempting a vCPU to try and guesstimate how much work the vCPU is
actually doing in order to make better scheduling decisions.
