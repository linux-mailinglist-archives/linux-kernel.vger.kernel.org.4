Current KVMGT usage is mostly in controlled mode, either user is own host a=
dmin,
or host admin would pre-configure specific limited number of VMs for KVMGT =
use.
I think printk on error should be fine, we don't need rate limit, and adding
extra trace monitor for admin might not be necessary. So I'm towards to kee=
p to
use current error message.
