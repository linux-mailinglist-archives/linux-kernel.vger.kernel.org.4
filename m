Maybe not enough, I guess.

For switch jump tables we need to know its *own* jump targets so that we 
can go through all its branches. If there are more than one indirect 
jump inside one function, only marks targets with BTI J can't help 
matching the entry and its targets.


Anyway I think this job is more for compiler. Switch jump tables is 
different from other indirect jump/call. It have fixed control flow just 
as if/else flow and the indirect jump table is just a compiler 
optimization which hide this.


Best,

Chen
