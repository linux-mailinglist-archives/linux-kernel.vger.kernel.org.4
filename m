I believe Ross misunderstood what you were asking for here. There are 
two reasons this is not possible or desired. The first reason is that on 
Intel, the DRTM log is not initialized by TrenchBoot code in the 
preamble. It is only responsible for allocating a buffer and recording 
the location in the TXT structures. When the SINIT ACM is executed, it 
will initialize the log and record the measurement that CPU sent 
directly to the TPM and then the measurements the ACM makes of the 
environment. If you pointed at the SRTM log, then the ACM would write 
over existing log, which I don't think you want. Now if you pointed at 
the tail end of the SRTM log, you would still end up with a second, 
separate log that just happens to be memory adjacent. The second reason 
is more from a trusted computing perspective, these are two different 
trust chains starting from two different Roots of Trust reflecting two 
different temporal states of the system, i.e. freshness. Typically this 
is were most will point out the need to have a measure of the resident 
firmware, i.e. SMM. To address that, should Intel to publish the spec 
for interacting with PPAM[1], TrenchBoot will be able to finally close 
the SMM gap, giving runtime validation of SMM.
