I was confused too. Honestly, it looks a bit messy to me.

My understanding is that this_cpu*() API has the following semantic:

    + this_cpu_*()* actively disables interrupts/preemption

    + __this_cpu_*() just warns when the task could migrate
		between CPUs.

    + raw_cpu_*() can be used in preemtible context when
		the validity is guaranteed another way.

this_cpu_ptr() does not fit the above. I guess that it is
because it is just providing the address and it is not
accessing the data. So it is enough to read the current
CPU id an atomic way.

IMHO, it would make sense to distinguish how the pointer is
going to be used. From this POV, __this_cpu_ptr() and
raw_cpu_ptr() would make more sense to me.

But it looks to me that this_cpu_ptr() has the same semantic
as per_cpu_ptr().

Yup, I am going to review the rest.
