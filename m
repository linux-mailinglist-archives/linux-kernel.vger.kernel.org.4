Agreed it is not clearly defined, but it was the same with nice levels. 
As in it changed a lot over the years how exactly they behave (with a 
few scheduler rewrites) and they were constantly at least somewhat 
useful as a mean of external control.

Nevertheless you will notice I have dropped everything priority based 
from the v2 of the RFC to simplify the conversation going forward.

GPUs will not be fully uniform either, especially in the terms of how 
well the controls work, which is why I am spelling out how this is only 
attempting to do "soft limits", everywhere in the documentation, cover 
letter and patch commit message.

But at least concept of GPU time feels to me like a very universal one 
so should be something which we can base the control on.

I have dropped this from v2 as well, to focus the feedback on most 
important points.

But in general the problem it wanted to address is that a single cgroup 
can contain multiple processes, each with zero to N open DRM file 
descriptors to any random GPU which happens to be installed in the 
system. And it can all change dynamically. It may be different vendors 
or different hardware generations, where some do not support the 
required functionality to support the cgroup controller.

So I wanted to give the sysadmin some visibility if at any given time 
the configuration applied to a cgroup has a chance to work fully, or 
only partially.

For instance with i915 we can have two supported devices in a laptop - 
integrated and discrete. Integrated can support the controller well, 
while for discrete is work in progress, maybe comes in the next kernel 
release. And then we can have this:

1)

cgexec -g drm:gfx/clients glxgears

This runs fully on integrated and budgeting works as expected.

2) DRI_PRIME=1 cgexec -g drm:gfx/clients glxgears

This one runs on the discrete GPU where budgeting does not work yet. 
While at the same time there can be another client in the same cgroup 
for which budgeting works. Or in other words:

cgexec -g drm:gfx/clients transcode_me_a_video
DRI_PRIME=1 cgexec -g drm:gfx/clients run_a_game

In this case game is not taking part in budgeting, even though it is a 
same driver. Maybe it will in a few kernel releases but not yet. Or in 
case of super old GPUs maybe support never gets added.

Perhaps I am over complicating things and what it would enough is to log 
the capability per device during driver probe:

i915 0000:00:02.0: DRM cgroup support: weights
i915 0000:01:00.0: DRM cgroup support: none

?

I think I completed this part in v2. At least some quick smoke testing 
showed me that budgets now correctly propagate through the tree.

Not guaranteeing no bugs just yet and there are certainly still things 
to polish up in v2.
