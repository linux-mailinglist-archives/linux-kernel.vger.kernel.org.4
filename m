We would only modify drivers that need this special handling, so it's
only console/graphics/disks/network/..., well, OK, I see your point,
it probably *would* be nearly every driver!

Yeah, I think you're right.  A few more notes below.

I think there's an argument that pcie_portdrv_shutdown() doesn't
actually need to clear bus mastering on *any* platform.

For reboot and poweroff, we only use .shutdown(), and .shutdown() only
needs to stop DMA and interrupts.  Clearing bus master enable stops
MSI/MSI-X since that's a DMA, but doesn't do anything to stop INTx,
which portdrv does use in some cases.

But those .remove() methods *do* clear the interrupt enables for each
service (PCI_ERR_ROOT_COMMAND, PCI_EXP_DPC_CTL, PCI_EXP_SLTCTL, and
PCI_EXP_RTCTL), so all the interrupts should be disabled regardless of
whether they are MSI/MSI-X or INTx, even without disabling bus
mastering.

So I would argue that omitting the pci_disable_device() here might be
enough, and we wouldn't need the quirk at all.
