Arnd, thanks for rounding these up and posting them.

I agree we need to get these all cleaned up, but before we go too far
down the rabbit hole, is there some better way to track these?

Not that I would suggest using an external tracker, but maybe at least
put each set of related warnings (e.g., those having the same frequency)
in its own subthread with the config/compiler info included.
