Circling back to this.  Pending testing, the "proper" refcounting approach =
seems
to be the way to go.  KVM's existing memslots actually work this way, e.g. =
if
userspace does munmap() on an active memslot, KVM zaps any PTEs but the mem=
slot
stays alive.  A similar approach can be taken here, the only wrinkle is tha=
t the
association between gmem and the memslot is stronger than between VMAs and =
memslots,
specifically KVM binds the file and not simply the file descriptor.  This i=
s
necessary because not binding to an exact file would let userspace install =
a
different file at the file descriptor.

That's solvable without having to delete memslots though, e.g. by protectin=
g the
file pointer in the memslot with RCU and directly bumping the refcount in t=
he two
places where KVM needs to get at gmem (the file) via the memslot (unbind an=
d
faulting in a page).  E.g.

  static struct file *kvm_gmem_get_file(struct kvm_memory_slot *slot)
  {
	struct file *file;

	rcu_read_lock();

	file =3D rcu_dereference(slot->gmem.file);
	if (file && !get_file_rcu(file))
		file =3D NULL;
	rcu_read_unlock();

	return file;
  }

The gotcha is that ->release could race with memslot deletion, as kvm_gmem_=
unbind()
won't be able to differentiate between "file was deleted" and "file is curr=
ently
being deleted".  That's easy enough to deal with though, kvm_gmem_release()=
 can
take slots_lock to prevent the memslot from going away when nullifying and
invalidating ranges for the memslot.

 The easy

There's a bug here, but not the one I pointed out.  Acquiring kvm->srcu doe=
sn't
provide any protection, the binding already has a pointer to the memslot, i=
.e.
isn't doing an SRCU-protected lookup in the memslots.  The actual protectio=
n is
provided by the filemap invalidate lock, which prevents unbinding a memslot=
 until
all invalidations complete, i.e. acquiring kvm->srcu in the punch hole path=
 is
completely unnecessary.
