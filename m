I don't know how widespread EDR implementation is.  What is the
user-visible issue without this fix?  "lspci" shows status bits set
even after recovery?  Subsequent EDR notifications cause us to report
errors that were previously reported and recovered?  Spurious EDR
notifications because of status bits that should have been cleared?
This kind of information would be useful in the commit log anyway.

Since the risk is low (the change only affects EDR processing) and the
the experience without this change might be poor (please clarify what
that experience is), I think I would be inclined to mark it for
stable.

This sounds like a plausible assumption.  But is there actually spec
language that says EDR notification is not allowed in the AER native
case (when OS owns the AER Capability)?  I looked but didn't find
anything.

I agree.

dpc_process_error() calls pci_aer_clear_nonfatal_status() in *some*
(but not all) cases.  I didn't try to work out whether those match the
cases where pcie_do_recovery() called it before 068c29a248b6.  I guess
we can assume it's equivalent for now.

Actually I do have one idea: in the firmware-first case, firmware
collects all the status information, clears it, and then passes the
status on to the OS.  In this case we don't need to clear the status
registers in handle_error_source(), pcie_do_recovery(), etc.

So I think the OS *should* be able to do something similar by
collecting the status information and clearing it first, before
starting error handling.  This might let us collect the status
clearing together in one place and also converge the firmware-first
and native error handling paths.

Obviously that would be a major future project.
