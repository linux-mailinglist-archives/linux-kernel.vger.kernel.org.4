PTR_MAYBE_NULL is another bit and I don't think it conflicts with PTR_TRUSTED.
PTR_TO_BTF_ID | PTR_TRUSTED is a valid pointer.
PTR_TO_BTF_ID | PTR_TRUSTED | PTR_MAYBE_NULL is a valid pointer or NULL.

PTR_TO_BTF_ID | PTR_MAYBE_NULL is a legacy "valid pointer" or NULL.
That legacy pointer cannot be passed to KF_TRUSTED_ARGS kfuncs.

KF_TRUSTED_ARGS kfuncs should not accept PTR_TO_BTF_ID | PTR_TRUSTED | PTR_MAYBE_NULL.
It's a job of the prog to do != NULL check.
Otherwise all such != NULL checks would need to move inside kfuncs which is not good.

I don't think MEM_ALLOC conflicts with PTR_TRUSTED.
MEM_ALLOC flags means that it came from bpf_obj_new() and that's what
bpf_spin_lock and bpf_obj_drop() want to see.

Adding PTR_TRUSTED to MEM_ALLOC looks necessary to me.
It doesn't have to be done right now, but eventually feels right.

I've been thinking whether reg->ref_obj_id > 0 condition should be converted
to PTR_TRUSTED too...
On one side it will simplify the check for KF_TRUSTED_ARGS.
The only thing check_kfunc_args() would need to do is:
is_kfunc_trusted_args(meta)
&& type_flag(reg->type) & PTR_TRUSTED
&& !(type_flag(reg->type) & PTR_MAYBE_NULL)

On the other side fixing all places where we set ref_obj_id
and adding |= PTR_TRUSTED may be too cumbersome ?

Right now we're saying PTR_TO_CTX is implicitly trusted, but we can OR
PTR_TO_CTX with PTR_TRUSTED to make it explicit and truly generalize the check.

to pass into KF_TRUSTED_ARGS kfunc? Agree.
I guess we can tighten the check a bit:
is_kfunc_trusted_args(meta)
&& type_flag(reg->type) & PTR_TRUSTED
&& !(type_flag(reg->type) & ~(PTR_TRUSTED | MEM_ALLOC))

In english: the pointer should have PTR_TRUSTED flag and
no other flags other than PTR_TRUSTED and MEM_ALLOC should be set.
