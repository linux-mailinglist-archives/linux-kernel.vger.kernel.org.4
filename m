I think this is all a lot of confusion, mostly on my part, sorry about
that.

Root Complex configuration and behavior is not specified by the PCIe
spec, so that's completely up to the i.MX designer.  It's fine for the
Root Complex to have an MSI Capability, and it's fine for that
capability to enable/disable the RC fielding of MSI MemWr transactions
from downstream devices and triggering MSI interrupts.

It's also fine for the RC MSI Capability to be identified with a
Capability ID of 0x5, although it is slightly confusing to use
PCI_CAP_ID_MSI to find it.  It's also slightly confusing to use the
PCI_MSI_FLAGS offset into the RC MSI Capability.

Using the PCI_CAP_ID_MSI, PCI_MSI_FLAGS, and PCI_MSI_FLAGS_ENABLE
macros suggests to the reader that this RC MSI capability is the same
as the the MSI Capability defined by PCIe r6.0, sec 7.7.1.  Obviously
it is *not* the same, because we're talking about a *Root Complex*
capability, while the sec 7.7.1 capability can only appear on PCIe
functions (Root Ports, Endpoints, Switch Ports, etc).

I suggest a comment to the effect that this is a Root Complex MSI
Capability, not the MSI Capability defined by PCIe r6.0, sec 7.7.1.

Possibly even add new #defines in pci-imx6.c with different names,
even though the values happen to be the same as the PCI_MSI_*
#defines.  That would be a convenient place to put a comment about
what they are.
