Are you asking for help in the regression tracking?

Could do both.

Christoph mentioned Debian's reportbug utility. That does a pretty good
job at walking people through how to report a bug. It could also get
information about the current environment that would be useful too. Perhaps
something like that?

The sad part is that most people that are going to report a bug is not
going to read a full document to figure out how to do it. Usually when
someone hits a bug, they are doing something else. And it's a burden to
report it. Obviously, they want it to be fixed, but it's viewed as a favor
to the developer and not the user to get it fixed, as it's likely seen as a
mistake by the developer that the bug exists in the first place.

Having a tool like reportbug that walks you through the steps of reporting
it would be the best way to do so. As the reporter doesn't need to think
too hard and just answer questions and let the tool do all the work.

The tool could possibly reply with known issues, and state something like
"We are aware of this issue, and are currently trying to figure it out."
