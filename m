Finally we are on the same page.) I didn't thought it was a bug
though. Some details of the problem I described in another thread
earlier today:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220926205333.qlhb5ojmx4sktzt5@mobilestation/
(See my note regarding the "dma-ranges" usage, which I accidentally
addressed to William instead of you.)

You are right. The PCI-specific dma-ranges semantic hasn't been well
thought through in the first place. The child devices should have had
a dedicated method to set their own way of the memory ranges mapping.

Just a thought. As a possible solution for the dma-ranges property
being dedicated for the child devices we could introduce a new "space
code" of the dma-ranges property with a flag which would indicate the
actual bridge/host-controller memory range. If the dma-ranges property
doesn't have an entry with such code the mapping could be considered
as direct (in accordance with the parental dma-ranges properties).
IOMMU-part is applicable for all PCIe-related hierarchy - bridge itself
and peripheral devices.

Do you mean something like this?

< 	struct dma_chan *dchan = ...;
< 	struct dw_edma_chan *chan = ...;
< 	struct device *parent = chan->dw->chip->dev;
<
< 	if (dev_of_node(parent)) {
< 		struct device_node *node = dev_of_node(parent);
< 
< 		ret = of_dma_configure(&chan->dev->device, node, true);
< 	} else if (has_acpi_companion(parent)) {
< 		struct acpi_device *adev = to_acpi_device_node(parent->fwnode);
<
< 		ret = acpi_dma_configure(&chan->dev->device, acpi_get_dma_attr(adev));
< 	} else {
<		ret = -EINVAL;
<	}
<
< 	if (ret)
< 		return ret;
<
<	/* Drop the detected dma-ranges mapping since it isn't applicable for
< 	 * the PCIe RP/EP bridge itself but to the peripheral devices only.
<	 */
<	dchan->dev->device.dma_range_map = NULL;
< 	dchan->dev->chan_dma_dev = true;
< 
< 	return 0;

What about the DMA-mask? Will it be ok if I copy it from the parental device?
Like this:

<	dma_coerce_mask_and_coherent(&dchan->dev->device, dma_get_mask(parent));

Judging by the of_dma_configure_id() method implementation the mask
upper bound is calculated based on the dma-ranges entries. Since the
DT-property isn't applicable for the PCIe host platform device itself
then it' upper bound most like will be invalid for the bridge too.
