My review comment above referred to the final MEM_SIZE value after the
whole series, so 512 MiB + 64 KiB.

I placed that review comment on patch 4 since it's the only patch in this
series that modified the code comment about MEM_TEST_MOVE_SIZE.

Now MEM_TEST_MOVE_SIZE is too high for arm64-4KB and arm64-64KB cases
(it needs 160 KiB in the last slot but has less available in these two
cases).

Using a test size of 192 KiB instead seems like a small difference
from the original size of 200 KiB, while still being aligned to
64 KiB.

The move benchmarks runtime difference on x86-4KB with this size
(compared to sizes of 200 KiB and 320 KiB) seems to be negligible.

Since it's an odd number of 64 KiB pages (3) the code that halves
this number of pages will need to be adjusted to operate on raw
sizes instead.

I can see a single block of code that will need such adjustment:
> if (lastpages < move_pages / 2) {
>         *maxslots = 0;
>         return false;
> }   

Similar remark goes for the case (1) above, where you'll probably need
to use 64 KiB test area size (it's only an intermediate form of code
before the final patch changes this value so it's fine if it doesn't
perform as well as the final form of the code).
