Coiby, thank you for adding these details.  I was hoping others would
chime in as well.  I agree at minimum there should be a warning.

Perhaps instead of making INTEGRITY_CA_MACHINE_KEYRING dependent on
INTEGRITY_MACHINE_KEYRING, make them a Kconfig "choice" to support the
more restrictive certificate use case requirements:  all certificates,
CA certificate signing and digital signature, only CA certificate
signing.
