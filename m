Hello Michael.

Beware that containers are more or less based on sharing resources,
shared accounting is difficult and hence _accurate_ measurement may not
be available or the numbers need some amount of interpretation.

[OT: I suggest you move to cgroup v2, the entities are IMO better named
and it's also more futureproof ;-)]

I didn't read the thread but it's true that per-cpu batching may result
in an error (both signs in theory). Since around v5.13 the
implementation changed and error should be better:
O(nr_cpus * nr_cgroups(subtree) * MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH) -> O(nr_cpus * MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH).

The difference that you spot there is not caused (merely) by the per-cpu
optimization.
What you see as the difference is mainly kernel memory (e.g. dentries,
inodes, task_struct,...) -- RSS+Cache would only show memory that
userspace is directly responsible for but not the kernel structures
(whose size depends on kernel implementation afterall).

(On v2, you could see breakdown of the kernel memory usage besides
others in memory.stat.)

I hope the abve sheds some light on these questions.
