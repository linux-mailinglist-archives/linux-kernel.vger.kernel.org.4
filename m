Yap, exactly. And I have had a bunch of times a git warning in my tree
complaining about "master" being an ambiguous reference which was fun to
chase down the first time.

In tip we opted for either calling the tag "<branch-name>-<date>" -
which I still think is suboptimal because then you have to go and
match the date to the release which was current at the time.

Or use my vastly superior idea of <branch-name>_for_<kernel-version>
which tells you everything you wanna know. :-)

Yap, exactly.

Yes, makes perfect sense to me. I had a hunch that it would be something
along the lines of: the tag doesn't really need to be a 1st class object
in the pulling repo and it is good enough if it is part of the pull
request text only.

So thanks for explaining.
