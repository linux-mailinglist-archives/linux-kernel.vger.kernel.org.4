The short answer is that I'm not really clear what this looks like so
it's hard to say.

Usually things for anything generic end up in drivers/base/regmap but it
should be generic in some way and thus far the code that's been posted
has been very much looking specific to a single device even where it's
been named as something generic.  I've not been able to extract a clear
picture of what the hardware that's being described is and the code has
looked like it's more some vaugely related designs than anything really
shared, it's really felt like people just want to just merge whatever
they have in which case just putting it in the driver is the most
expedient thing.

Clearly the concept of a register map accessed via indirection is a
generic thing but to implement that at the very least the underlying
register map should be another regmap rather than hard coded to MMIO.

One of the things I've been unable to tell thus far is if this is a
single device with a consistent IP for register access (thus far I've
only seen clear evidence of one device) or if there's multiple devices
that have been designed this way for some unclear reason.  AIUI these
are IPs within a single FPGA which is the top level MFD here?  If this
is one FPGA then perhaps the top level driver for the FPGA ought to just
handle whatever weirdness the FPGA has?  The fact that there doesn't
seem to be a name for this stuff makes it seem device specific.

The code that I've seen posted has looked like the register layout isn't
shared, all the register offsets have been variable, but there's this
thing with there being what looks like a command queue/IO completion
thing which seemed to be the only kind of substantial thing being
shared.
