There are lots of possible models for this. One simple option if the assigned
VF supports it is a CMA instance per VF. That will let the guest
do full attestation including measurement of whether the device is
appropriately locked down so the hypervisor can't mess with
configuration that affects the guest (without a reset anyway and that
is guest visible). Whether anyone builds that option isn't yet clear
though. If they do, Lukas' work should work there as well as for the
host OS. (Note I'm not a security expert so may be missing something!)

For extra fun, why should the device trust the host? Mutual authentication
fun (there are usecases where that matters)

There are way more complex options supported in PCIe TDISP (Tee Device
security interface protocols). Anyone have an visibility of open solutions
that make use of that? May be too new.
