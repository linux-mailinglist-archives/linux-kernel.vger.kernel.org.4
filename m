As these macros describe original Intel x86 API, it can be used also in
arch/x86 PCI code.

IIRC that legacy x86-specific code is used also on modern AMD processors
which have broken ECAM. AMD supports that extended version of CF8/CFC
with access to PCIe extended config space registers.

Well, if you like this change, let me know where to put those new
macros, into which file and in which subdirectory, and I can prepare a
new patch version.

But doing all those arm64, x86, ACPI cleanup is a huge cross-tree work
which I'm really not going to do...
