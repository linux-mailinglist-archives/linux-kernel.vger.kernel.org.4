Well, I definitely cannot afford a dedicated CI just for my tree and I
haven't got any useful information from KernlCI yet (even though hey
pull and test my linux-next branch on a regular basis).

KernelCI seems to be focusing on different set of hardware, so to speak.

I think it could also be possible to contribute to KernelCI to get
more useful x86 coverage from it.
