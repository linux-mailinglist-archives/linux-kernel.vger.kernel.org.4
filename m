Yes and no, but no:

A kernel change exposed this problem, hence it doesn't matter if the
BIOS is faulty: it's makes it a kernel regression and those are not
allowed. For more on this see
https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/reporting-issues.html

That at least would be the normal approach. But the thing is: the legal
implications when it comes to things like wifi make this somewhat
trickier. :-/

Well, you where the author of the commit, that's why I addressed you.
But if Gregory or someone else steps in that's of course totally fine
for me as well. :-D

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
