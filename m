Ah ok, now I get it. Never noticed that naming it "free_rcu" could be
misleading. It is only ever called from pte_free_tlb(), so always in that
"semi-RCU" context. If you just look at the name, you could expect this
to always free pagetables by RCU, which would be exactly what you need
for pte_free_defer(), and which of course cannot be guaranteed by our
page_table_free_rcu().

IOW, exactly what your comment says, and now I think it is actually fine
as it is :-)

I guess I am a bit lamebrained this week, due to early shift and not
enough sleep...

I was mislead by the comment saying "If page is on the list", in an
else path where we also end up for pages not on the list any more.
I guess I would have added something like "it is also ok to do
list_del_init() here for pages not on the list". But thinking again,
that would probably just be a reminder of how list_del_init() works, 
which should be obvious anyway, at least for people with enough sleep.

Agree.

Since none of my remarks on the comments seem valid or strictly necessary
any more, and I also could not find functional issues, I think you can add
this patch as new version for 07/12. And I can now give you this:
