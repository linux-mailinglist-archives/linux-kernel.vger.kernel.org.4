That approach seems irresponsible to me as you force users to report
the issue, you force developers to add a quirk.  Users expect things
to just work.  And that's precisely what this patch will achieve.

Lino introduced the issues by universally enabling interrupts.
He acted responsibly by making the issue disappear most likely
for everyone.  I find it bewildering that you'd prefer the opposite
approach and rather inflict on every affected user to open a
bug report and hope that someone writes a patch for them.

So far interrupts are only enabled in an rc release and linux-next,
yet issue reports have popped up quickly.  My expectation is we'll
see a lot more reports once v6.4-final is released, doubly so when
the next stable kernel with that feature is released.

If you choose a too low number, you'll get false positives due to
regular interrupt assertion either by the TPM or by another device
sharing the interrupt.

Those numbers may have to be fine-tuned over time to eliminate
false positives and false negatives.  They're as good a number as
any to get that fine-tuning process started.

No, absolutely not.  If you return IRQ_NONE here then genirq code
will increase the spurious interrupt counter.  That's bad because
the IRQ storm detection tpm_tis_core.c would race with the IRQ storm
detection in genirq code:

Note that disablement of the interrupt must happen in a work_struct
here to avoid a deadlock. (The deadlock would occur because
devm_free_irq() waits for the interrupt handler to finish.)

Now, let's say the 1000 unhandled interrupts limit has been reached
and the work_struct is scheduled.  If the work_struct isn't run
quickly enough, you may reach the 99900 limit in note_interrupt()
(see kernel/irq/spurious.c) and then genirq code will force the
interrupt off completely.

To avoid that you *have* to return IRQ_HANDLED here and thus pretend
towards genirq code that the interrupt was not spurious.

But not harmful either, is it?
