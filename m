This is an interesting test case. Thanks for bringing it up. I don't 
know if there's a way for the script to filter out these kinds of 
changes, so it may just need to be noted under possible false positives 
in the document.

It also reveals that the script isn't filtering out non-headers from the 
git diffs... I'll fix that in v3.

You're correct, this case is missed when only checking modified headers. 
With the same patch, if I pass "-a" to the script, it does catch the change:

% ./scripts/check-uapi.sh -a
--- snip ---
error - 1/1328 UAPI headers modified between HEAD and dirty tree are not 
backwards compatible
error - UAPI header ABI check failed


% cat abi_error_log.txt
Generated by "./scripts/check-uapi.sh -a" from git ref 
94b1166f7954f1136f307dafbaad5f9d871b73bf

!!! ABI differences detected in include/uapi/linux/eventpoll.h from HEAD 
-> dirty tree !!!

     [C] 'struct epoll_event' changed:
       type size changed from 96 to 80 (in bits)
       2 data member changes:
         type of '__poll_t events' changed:
           underlying type 'unsigned int' changed:
             type name changed from 'unsigned int' to 'unsigned short int'
             type size changed from 32 to 16 (in bits)
         '__u64 data' offset changed from 32 to 16 (in bits) (by -16 bits)

Perhaps in the next revision we could add some way to detect these 
dependencies (e.g. if foo.h includes bar.h, and bar.h was modified, we 
should check foo.h). However, the time savings may not be worth the 
complicated and potentially fragile dependency detection.

For now, "-a" should catch this, and it only took about 1 minute to run 
through all the headers on my 8-core machine, so it should be a 
resonable test step for a CI system.

Right, it certainly has its shortcomings. I appreciate you helping us 
find and address them! Even in its current state, I believe the script 
has value for developers and reviewers. :)

Thanks for the tip, that explains it. Should be able to address this in v3.

Yes, my understanding is that since the script is all encapsulated in 
functions, the shell has loaded all of the functions before execution 
starts. My testing has shown this to be safe as well. Will add a comment 
in v3.

Ah, you're right it is not necessary. Previously, we were calling 
headers_install.sh directly, so make wasn't there to supply the unifdef 
dependency. Will remove this in v3.

Agreed, I think this is a confusing case for native English-speakers too. :)

I want to indicate that one ref has to come after the other in the Git
