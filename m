yes,innosilicon is the HDMI IP  and verisilicon is the DC-controller IP

I have done a HDMIcomparison of the rk3036 and the jh7110, and they are both based on ip Innosilicon.

the hardware of them .
Some parts of the hardware of the two are common, such as the logic of hdmi I2C to obtain edid, and the register definition is consistent.

Many registers are defined differently from the linux main line inno driver, including registers that contain specific bits
and some registers in linux main line inno driver no longer used in my new inoo hdmi hardware.

I will change the  the binding  to meet innosilicon,hdmi .
for the drivers part , I will study the possibility of RK-HDMI reuse.
