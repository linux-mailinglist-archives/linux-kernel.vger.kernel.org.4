While I agree, it's all better than the naming we use right now ...


Let me throw "tee_mem" / "memfd_tee" into the picture. That could 
eventually catch what we want to have.

Or "coco_mem" / "memfd_coco".

Of course, both expect that people know the terminology (just like what 
"vm" stands for), but it's IMHO significantly better than 
restricted/guarded/opaque/whatsoever.

Again, expresses what it's used for, not why it behaves in weird ways.

Yes.

Yes, it's all better than jumping through hoops to come up with a bad 
name like "restrictedmem".

Yes.

I agree. But if it's as simple as providing an ioctl for that hypervisor 
that simply wires up the existing implementation, it's not too bad.

Right. Or we still succeed in finding a name that's not as bad as what 
we had so far.
