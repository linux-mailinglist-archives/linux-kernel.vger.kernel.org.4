Going forward my plan is to allocate all existing DOE mailboxes
of a device upon enumeration.  That will allow concurrent use
of a mailbox by multiple drivers.

When a pci_dev goes away, say, because it's been hot-removed,
we need a way to abort all ongoing DOE exchanges.

pci_doe_flush_mb() seems to do just that so I'm not sure why
it's being removed?

Thanks,

Lukas
