This is a rather deep dive in the cache line usage but the most
important thing is really missing. Why do we want this change? From the
context it seems that this is an actual fix for isolcpu= setup when
remote (aka non isolated activity) interferes with isolated cpus by
scheduling pcp charge caches on those cpus.

Is this understanding correct?

If yes, how big of a problem that is? If you want a remote draining then
you need some sort of locking (currently we rely on local lock). How
come this locking is not going to cause a different form of disturbance?
