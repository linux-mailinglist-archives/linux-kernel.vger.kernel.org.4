Add a more complete support for vncl4040 and vcnl4200, which allows to
change the distance of proximity detection and interrupt support for the
illuminance sensor.

Proximity functionality:
  - Interrupt support (new on vcnl4200).

Proximity reduce the amount of interrupts:
  - Adaptable integration time (new on vcnl4200) - the sampling rate
    changes according to this value.
  - Period - interrupt is asserted if the value is above or
    below a certain threshold.

Proximity change the activity distance:
  - Oversampling ratio - Amount of LED pulses per measured raw value.
  - Calibration bias - LED current calibration of the sensor.

Illuminance functionality:
  - Interrupt support.

Illuminance reduce the amount of interrupts:
  - Adaptable integration time - the sampling rate and scale changes
    according to this value.
  - Period â€“ interrupt is asserted if the value is above or
    below a certain threshold.

changes v2:
- [PATCH v2 3/7] Fixed calculation of al_scale.
  Fix the value of vcnl4040 according to the data-sheet.
  Use div_u64 for the division.
scription for the branch

changes v3:
- [PATCH v3 1-3/7] Add differences between the chips as variables in
  chip-spec.
- [PATCH v3 4/7] Changed commit message.
- [PATCH v3 5/7] Use period instead of debounce time. This causes some
  calculations as the period is a time and the chip allows to set a certain
  amount of measurements above/below the threshold, before throwing an
  interrupt.
- [PATCH v3 6/7] Changed commit message.

changes v4:
- [PATCH v3 1-3/7] Fix setting correct als_it for vcnl4040.
- [PATCH v3 5/7] Use MICRO macro.
  Fix values greater than 1 s for the proximity period.

changes v5:
[PATCH v5 2/7]:
- Calculate ps_it from ps_it_times by usinh NSEC_PER_USEC.
[PATCH v5 3/7]:
- Calculate als_it from ps_it_times by using NSEC_PER_USEC.
- Store scale step factor in chip_spec.
- Fixes sampling_rate to ns + 20 %.
[PATCH v5 3/7 - 7/7]
- Changed formatting.
- Changed some variable names.

- Changed formatting.
- Changed some variable names.

changes v6:
Added [PATCH v6 3/8]:
- Add switch case for IIO_PROXIMITY check.
 [PATCH v5 1/7 - 7/7]
- Changed formatting.
[PATCH v5 3/7, 5/7, 6/7, 7/7]
- Changed loop.
- Changed some variable names.
