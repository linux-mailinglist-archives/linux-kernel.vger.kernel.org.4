If we move to arch_wants_pte_order() as you suggested (in your response to patch
3) then I agree we can remove most of these. I still think we might want 2
though. For an arch that does not implement arch_wants_pte_order() we wouldn't
want LARGE_ANON_FOLIO to show up in menuconfig so we would still need
ARCH_SUPPORTS_LARGE_ANON_FOLIO:


config ARCH_SUPPORTS_LARGE_ANON_FOLIO
       def_bool n
       help
         An arch should select this symbol if wants to allow LARGE_ANON_FOLIO
         to be enabled. In this case, It must also define arch_wants_pte_order()

config LARGE_ANON_FOLIO
       bool "Allocate large folios for anonymous memory"
       depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_LARGE_ANON_FOLIO
       default n
       help
         Use large (bigger than order-0) folios to back anonymous memory where
         possible. This reduces the number of page faults, as well as other
         per-page overheads to improve performance for many workloads.

What do you think?
