I don't think these changes require a redesign. I do like the idea that
the events live with the fd. That is, when the fd dies, so does the event.

Although, we may keep it around for a bit (no new events, but being
able to parse it. That is, the event itself isn't deleted until the fd
is closed, and so is the tracing files being read are closed.

Beau,

How hard is it to give the event an owner, but not for task or user,
but with the fd. That way you don't need to worry about other tasks
deleting the event. And it also automatically cleans itself up. If we
leave it to the sysadmin to clean up, it's going to cause leaks,
because it's not something the sysadmin will want to do, as they will
need to keep track of what events are created.

PS. I missed my connection due to unseasonal freezing temperatures, and
my little airport didn't have a driver for the deicer, making my flight
2 hours delayed (had to wait for the sun to come up and deice the
plane!). Thus, instead of enjoying myself by the pool, I'm in an
airport lounge without much to do.
