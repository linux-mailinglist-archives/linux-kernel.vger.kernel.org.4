The added internal lock has ~zero perf impact on rstat flush cause
the lock won't be contended basically.

As I mentioned, the main motivation with internal lock is to make the fix as
simple as possible since cross-subsystem change isn't involved, and I am fine
with any following cleanup or improvement on current blkg rstat flush.

Another benefit with this internal lock is that race in blkcg_reset_stats()
can be avoided.
