Hello Damien,
I also noticed random issues I suspect to be related to link status or powe=
r
state, in my case it sometimes happens that the BARs (0-6) in the config
space get reset to 0. This is not due to the driver because the driver neve=
r
ever accesses these registers (@0xfd80'0010 to 0xfd80'0024 TRM
17.6.4.1.5-17.6.4.1.10).
I don't think the host rewrites them because lspci shows the BARs as
"[virtual]" which means they have been assigned by host but have 0
value in the endpoint device (when lspci rereads the PCI config header).
See https://github.com/pciutils/pciutils/blob/master/lspci.c#L422

So I suspect the controller detects something related to link status or
power state and internally (in hardware) resets those registers. It's not
the kernel code, it never accesses these regs. The problem occurs
very randomly, sometimes in a few seconds, sometimes I cannot see
it for a whole day.

Is this similar to what you are experiencing ?
Do you have any idea as to what could make these registers to be reset
(I could not find anything in the TRM, also nothing in the driver seems to
cause it).

Do you want me to include this patch in the V3 series or will you
submit another patch series for the changes you applied on the RK3399 PCIe
endpoint controller ? I don't know if you prefer to build the V3
together or if you
prefer to submit another patch series on top of mine. Let me know.

Best regards.
Rick
