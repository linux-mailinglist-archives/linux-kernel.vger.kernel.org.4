It's not really special in that the problem could also be triggered by
other hotplug but it is the most common scenario where you'd run into
this problem. Some background. If you simply do a "echo 0 >
/sys/bus/pci/slots/<func>/power" and then power on again the PCI
resources are not removed because the function stays visible to the
system just deconfigured. To trigger removal you'd have to move a
single function to a different system in the machine hypervisor but
then you're less likely to bring it back again so the dangling resource
pointer won't cause problems. When using "../sriov_numvfs" to change
the number of VFs however they are temporarily removed and then re-
appear.

Yes the problem is that the old code did muddy the water here because
it didn't properly separate which resources are tied to a PCI function
and which to the bus as a whole. I tried to fix this in this patch.

But  let me first explain lifetimes of the struct zpci_bus and struct
zpci_bus. As our basic architecture works with one struct zpci_dev per
function and they can be hot(un-)plugged in any order but we still want
to support exposing the topology within a multi-function PCI device the
struct zpci_bus representing the PCI bus on which the functions reside
is created when the first PCI function on that bus is discovered and it
exists until the last PCI function on that bus disappears.

Yes exactly. The problem is that I got confused with how to map our
model where the BAR resources are strictly tied to the PCI function to
the common API which more closely resembles real hardware and where the
BAR resources are tied to the PCI bus. Instead of making sure that the
per-function resources are added and removed together with the PCI
function matching when they are accessible in our architecture I added
them to the struct zpci_bus and didn't properly remove them neither
from sruct zpci_bus nor the common PCI bus though they were freed thus
creating the use-after free in two places at once. I think somehow I
had though that release_resource() somehow removed it from the resource
lists.

Yes the current code adds new resources on remove + add while leaving
dangling freed resources in the list creating kind of half duplicates.
It's only due to the order that we end up using the freed dangling
resources instead of the new ones.

Yes I think you're right it does nothing and can be dropped.

Hmm. great find. This seems to have been weird and redundant since I
first used that pattern in 3047766bc6ec ("s390/pci: fix enabling a
reserved PCI function"). I think maybe then the reason for this was
that prior to 960ac3626487 ("s390/pci: allow zPCI zbus without a
function zero") when the newly enabled is devfn =3D=3D 0 there could be
functions from the same bus which would not have been added yet. I'm
not sure though. That was definitely the idea behind the
zpci_bus_scan_bus() in zpci_scan_configured_devices() that is also
redundant now as we can now scan each function as it appears.

This will definitely need to be cleaned up.

Yes that was the situation before this patch. After this patch only the
zpci_bus.bus_resource is in this resources list. After this patch the
BAR resources are not on the list and only referred to via zdev-
>bars[i].res thus tying them to struct zpci_dev.

Currently Linux does not see PCI-to-PCI bridges on s390. We do have
PCIe switches in the hardware in the so called I/O drawers but they are
hidden from us by firmware. There have been some ideas about having
PCI-to-PCI bridges visible to Linux but nothing concrete at the moment.

As far as I can see pci_free_resource_list() only calls kfree() on the
entry not on entry->res. The resources set up in
zpci_setup_bus_resources() are freed in zpci_cleanup_bus_resources()
explicitly.

Yes I did not find a lock that is specifically for bus->resources but
it seemed to me that changes to resources would only affect things
running under the rescan/remove lock.
