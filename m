That's interesting, though also slightly scary in that it sounds like you've
already shipped some major fscrypt changes without review!

Well, the keyrings subsystem never worked properly for fscrypt anyway.  At most,
it's only useful for providing the key to the filesystem initially (by passing a
key ID to FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY, instead of the key bytes), similar to what
dm-crypt allows.  After that, the keyrings subsystem plays no role.

I'm open to making FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY accept other 'struct key' types,
like "trusted" which has been discussed before and which dm-crypt supports.

Just don't assume that just because you have a key, that you automatically
*need* the keyrings subsystem.  Normally just passing the key bytes in the ioctl
works just as well and is much simpler.  Same for dm-crypt, which normally takes
the key bytes in the device-mapper table parameters...
