Why doesn't it work fine when the system is in s2idle then?

Getting to the root of this would be really helpful here IMO.

I would rather write "unless then can be power-managed with the help
of the platform firmware".

The meaning of "signaling" is unclear in this context and even if it
was clear, the platform firmware support actually needs to be used
here, its mere existence is not sufficient AFAICS.
