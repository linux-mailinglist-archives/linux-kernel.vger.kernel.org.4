I was being too clever by half, my comment had nothing to do with your
interest, or lack thereof about TPM's.... :-)

I had replied to one of the threads where LSM stacking and IMA
integration issues were being discussed and I commented that TSEM may
contribute to those conversations.  You had replied back and said that
sending teasers was unfair, I was suggesting with my comment that you
were holding your breath waiting for the release of TSEM.... :-)

On a related note to this thread, a major component of Quixote/TSEM is
the notion of raising the question and opportunity for shaping what
TPM's should be when they grow up, given the limited resources they
bring to the table, let alone the notion that they are about
retrospective rather than prospective trust.

Hardly anyone has, small team, very focused, working in a deep dive
for the last couple of years to bring this forward.

Hopefully it will prove of interest and utility, I don't believe there
is a reference in the literature to an equivalent approach.

Have a good evening.

As always,
