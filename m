There are discussions in [1] about making atomic rstat flush not
disable irqs throughout the process, so in that case it would only
result in a similar situation if the caller has irq disabled. The only
caller that might have irq disabled is the same caller that might be
in irq context before this series: mem_cgroup_usage().

On that note, and while I have your attention, I was wondering if we
can eliminate the flush call completely from mem_cgroup_usage(), and
read the global stats counters for root memcg instead of the root
counters. There might be subtle differences, but the root memcg usage
isn't super accurate now anyway (e.g. it doesn't include kernel
memory).

With that removed, no callers to rstat flushing would be from irq
context or have irqs disabled. There will only be one atomic flusher
(mem_cgroup_wb_stats()), and we can proceed with [1] if it causes a
problem.

What do you think?
