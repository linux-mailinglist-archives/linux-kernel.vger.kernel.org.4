So, sk_sndbuf influece the sender and sk_rcvbuf the receiver, right?

We should check if VMCI behaves the same.

Can you elaborate a bit here?

Do you mean some mechanism to report to the sender that a destination
(cid, port) is full so the packet will be dropped?

Can we adapt the credit mechanism?

I see.

Makes sense to me.

I left some preliminary comments, anyway now it seems reasonable to use
the same virtqueues, so we can go head with the spec proposal.

Thanks,
