Sorry, it's not a good wording.

The thing is that supporting calls that return more than one page of
data is absolutely required, and this interface built around fixed size
data transfer can't do it.

So it sounds like a ticked for redoing the driver right after it's
implemented, or ending up with two subtly different interfaces - one for
the calls that can return multiple pages of data, and one for the simple
calls.

That does not sound like a good idea at all to me.

It will not be entirely reliable because the data size may change over
time but assuming the performance is not an issue the caller can just
call again with a bigger buffer if the data hapens to grow at the very
moment they tried to retrieve it.
