Indeed that one doesn't appear to be in the quirk list currently. 
However the symptom of DMA traffic from function 1 which the IOMMU 
clearly wasn't expecting firmly suggests that it *does* need the quirk. 
Digging up the original report, the lspci output there suggests that 
07:00.1 isn't a real function, which would further confirm it.

The other thing which catches my interest is the seemingly-conflicting 
"iommu=soft" and "intel_iommu=on" arguments - I could well believe that 
refactoring the x86 IOMMU detection stuff might have subtly changed the 
interaction there, such that previously it ended up not actually using 
the IOMMU for DMA ops, but now it is?

Robin.
