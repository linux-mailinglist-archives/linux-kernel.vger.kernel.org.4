From what have you got this? I said that the current MC indexing
approach wasn't that optimal (always relying on the low-level driver
to allocate the index) because it caused having the same IDx
allocation pattern re-implemented in the drivers. It can be avoided by
the provided patch. The unified approach makes code indeed more
readable in the platform drivers and safer since they didn't have to
bother with more coding. See for instance the drivers with the
static variable-based IDs allocation. It doesn't seem like these
drivers bother with the detected DDR devices order. If so then the
automatic IDs allocation is perfect for them. Note the static variable
increment isn't atomic. Thus the ID allocation algorithm there is prone
to races should the devices probe is run concurrently.

Have you read it yourself? Here is a short excerpt from there:
"Once the problem is established, describe what you are actually doing
about it in technical detail.  It's important to describe the change
in plain English for the reviewer to verify that the code is behaving
as you intend it to."

So the "problem" is described in the first paragraph and the technical
details in the later paragraphs.
