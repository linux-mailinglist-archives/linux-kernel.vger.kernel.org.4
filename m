Maybe I misunderstood your question earlier. Are you concerned about guests
invoking any MMIO region specific calls in the ioremap path or passing
that information to the host ?
Earlier, I assumed the former but it seems you are also concerned
about the latter as well. Sorry for the confusion in that case.
The guest initiation is necessary while the host notification can be
made optional.
The "guest initiated" means the guest tells the TSM (equivalent of TDX
module in RISC-V) the MMIO region details.
The TSM keeps a track of this and any page faults that happen in that
region are forwarded
to the host by the TSM after the instruction decoding. Thus TSM can
make sure that only ioremapped regions are
considered MMIO regions. Otherwise, all memory outside the guest
physical region will be considered as the MMIO region.

In the current CoVE implementation, that MMIO region information is also
passed to the host to provide additional flexibility. The host may
choose to do additional
sanity check and bail if the fault address does not belong to
requested MMIO regions without
going to the userspace. This is purely an optimization and may not be manda=
tory.

This is a recent version of the above series from tdx github. This is
a WIP as well and has not been posted to
the mailing list. Thus, it may be going under revisions as well.
As per my understanding the above ioremap changes for TDX mark the
ioremapped pages as shared.
The guest->host communication happen in the #VE exception handler
where the guest converts this to a hypercall by invoking TDG.VP.VMCALL
with an EPT violation set. The host would emulate an MMIO address if
it gets an VMCALL with EPT violation.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

As I said above, the objective here is to notify the TSM where the
MMIO is. Notifying the host
is just an optimization that we choose to add. In fact, in this series
the KVM code doesn't do anything with that information.
The commit text probably can be improved to clarify that.
