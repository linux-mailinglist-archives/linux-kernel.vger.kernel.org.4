The think about "secretmem" that I kind-of like (a little) is that it 
explains what it's used for: storing secrets. We don't call it 
"unmapped" memory because we unmap it from the directmap or "unpinnable" 
memory or "inaccessible" memory ... or even "restricted" because it has 
restrictions ... how the secrets are protected is kind of an 
implementation detail.

So instead of describing *why*/*how* restrictedmem is the weird kid 
(restricted/guarded/hidden/restricted/inaccessible/ ...), maybe rather 
describe what it's used for?

I know, I know, "there are other use cases where it will be used outside 
of VM context". I really don't care. "memfd_vm" / "vm_mem" would be sooo 
(feel free to add some more o's here) much easier to get. It's a special 
fd to be used to back VM memory. Depending on the VM type 
(encrypted/protected/whatever), restrictions might apply (not able to 
mmap, not able to read/write ...). For example, there really is no need 
to disallow mmap/read/write when using that memory to back a simple VM 
where all we want to do is avoid user-space page tables.
