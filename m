No, it isn't, as per the code today and I don't think that this
particular part should be changed now.

_S0W may only cause acpi_pci_bridge_d3() to return false, it is not
sufficient for true to be returned.

This may be taken into consideration at one point, if need be, but not
in this particular patch IMO.

Well, not exactly.  The second point should be

 - Root Port's ACPI companion ('dev') has _PR0 or _PS0.

Yes, if _S0W is present and it evaluates successfully, then it is
required to confirm that wakeup signaling from at least D3hot is
supported for 'true' to be returned (but it is not sufficient for that
by itself).

That's the only functional change made by that patch and yes, the
patch below is what I mean.

Note that the adev->wakeup.flags.valid is still necessary in the cases
when _S0W is not present, because in those cases wakeup support
implies that it is supported in all D-states.  It is sort of redundant
when _S0W is present, but the current code has it and this particular
patch doesn't (or even shouldn't) change that.
