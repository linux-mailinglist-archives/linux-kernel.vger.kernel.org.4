I believe the amount of cacheline bouncing will be the same whether you 
read 32 or 16 bits from the lock word. At least this is my understanding 
of the x86 arch. Please correct me if my assumption is incorrect.

That is true. However, this patch causes one more read from the lock 
cacheline which isn't necessary for arches that won't benefit from it.Â  
So I am less incline to accept it unless there is evidence of the 
benefit it can bring.
