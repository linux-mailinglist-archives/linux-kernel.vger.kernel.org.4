Then we should remove overlay support. The only way it becomes more
complete is having actual users.

But really, whether this is the right solution to the problem is
independent of the state of kernel overlay support.

Most/all of this series is needed for a DT system in which the PCI
devices are not populated in the DT.

Instead of worrying about a theoretical problem, we should see if
there is an actual problem for a user.

I'm not so worried about DT functions themselves, but places which
have 'if ACPI ... else (DT) ...' paths.
