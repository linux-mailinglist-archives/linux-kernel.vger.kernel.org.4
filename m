Ahh, OK.  Could you include a comment to that effect, please?

Yeah, I'd suggest doing the nasty casting in the debug function.  That
makes it much more clear what the hardware is doing with the entries.
The hardware doesn't treat the struct as 2*u64's at all.

The wording you suggest is a bit imprecise.  For a 2M-aligned 4k page,
there is only *one* location, *one* entry.

Also, we're not doing a lookup for an RMP entry.  We're doing it for a
_pfn_ that results in an RMP entry.

How about this:

/*
 * Find the authoritative RMP entry for a PFN.  This can be either a 4k
 * RMP entry or a special large RMP entry that is authoritative for a
 * whole 2M area.
 */

Sounds good to me.  Just please make them consistent.
