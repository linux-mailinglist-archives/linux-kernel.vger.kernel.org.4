Ah, I see. When you put it like that it makes a lot of sense. Reclaim
would be just another type of demotion as you put it, i.e. demoting
from the lowest memory tier to storage. I assume in your model
demoting from the lowest memory tier to storage includes all of
swapping, writing back of dirty pages, and discarding clean file
pages. All these pages (anon, clean file pages, or dirty file pages)
should first be demoted down the memory tiers until finally they get
'demoted' to storage. i.e. reclaimed.

Also got it. I believe the pseudo code would be roughly like a bubble
sort algorithm of sorts, where the coldest pages are demoted to the
next memory tier, and finally reclaimed from the final memory tier:

demoted_pages = 0;
retry:
    memory_tier = lowest_tier:
    for (; memory_tier < 0; memory_tier--) {
        if (memory_tier == lowest_tier)
            demoted_pages += demote_to_storage();
        else
            demote_pages += demote_to_the_next_memory_tier(memory_tier);
    }
    if (demoted_pages < pages_to_demote)
         goto retry;

Thanks for taking the time to explain this. I think if it sounds good
to folks I'll add the "nodes=" arg as you described now. Reworking the
reclaim algorithm for memory tiering would be a bigger change in need
of its own patchset.

I think the nodes= arg by itself would help bridge the gap quite a
bit. I surmise for Google we can :
1. Force reclaim by: echo "<size> nodes=<lowest memory tier nodes>" >
memory.reclaim
2. Almost force demotion by: echo "<size> nodes=<highest memory tier
nodes>" > memory.reclaim

In case #2 the kernel may still reclaim it if it can't demote the full
amount, but that is as you put it more of a bug that should be fixed.

However, even in a world where the reclaim code works as you
described, I wonder if we still need some kind of demote= arg. The
issue is that demoting from the lowest memory tier to storage incurs
more of a latency impact to the application than demoting between the
other memory tiers, and that's because the other memory tiers are
directly addressable, while pages demote to storage incur a pagefault.
Not sure if that's a big concern at the moment.
