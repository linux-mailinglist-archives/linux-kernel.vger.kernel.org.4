Perhaps I elided too much - it does if you add a single lock. You can't
do that if it's not a common helper.

Yeah, I've seen the numbers for the perf impact of running as a module
due to the extra TLB overhead - but Mike's recent data was showing that
this doesn't matter nearly as much as data as it does for text.

Ok. Could we make it clearer why they're needed and what they're for?

I know bpf fills in invalid instructions initially; I didn't read
through enough code to find the "why", and let's document that to save
other people the same effort.

And do they really need to be callbacks in mod_alloc_params...?

Do we need the other things in mod_alloc_params/vmalloc_params?
 - your granularity field says it's for specifying PAGE/PMD size: we
   definitely do not want that. We've had way too much code along the
   lines of "implement hugepages for x", we need to stop doing that.
   It's an internal mm/ detail.

 - vmalloc_params: we need gfp_t and pgprot_t, but those should be
   normal arguments. start/end/vm_flags? They seem like historical
   module baggage, can we get rid of them?

Hey, it's been organized since I last looked at it :) But I tihink this
belongs in mm/, not module code.
