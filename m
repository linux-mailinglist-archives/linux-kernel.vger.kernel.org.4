Can you point out the scenario you are worried about?

For example, if anything is using a per-FD event, it cannot be deleted,
it will return -EBUSY. If perf, ftrace, or any user-process still has a
reference to the event, the delete will not go through (even without
these changes).

I read your previous issues as, we cannot let anyone delete events while
others are using them. And I also heard Steven state, we need to not let
things pile up, since manual deletes are unlikely.

If this is to be default, then I would have to have a flag for
persistent events, which seems reasonable.

We have certain events we want persistent, that don't go away if the
process crashes, etc. and we don't yet have a ring buffer up via
perf_events.

In these cases, we want the name to be the same for all processes, since
it's a common event. An example is a common library that emits out
assert messages. We want to watch for any asserts on the system,
regardless of which process emits them.

I'm not sure I understand how you think they would conflict?

Another process cannot come in and register the same event name while
it's in use. They can only do so once everything has been closed down.

If another process uses the same name for an event, it must match the
previous events arguments, and is treated as the same event. If they
don't match then the register fails. The only way to get a conflict is
to delete the event and then create a new one, but that only works if
no one is still using it at all.
