But isn't the root bridge discovered by the driver (pci-imx6 in this case) =
for=20
that? And the driver probe path eventually calls into the sysfs file creati=
on.
I compared the file creation to usb, as this is a discoverable bus as well.=
=20
There is no special initialization regarding sysfs.

Currently the initcall pci_sysfs_init and the PCIe root bridge driver probe
paths are competing for file creation.
If, for some reason, the device enumeration for PCI bus during imx6_pcie_pr=
obe=20
is delayed after pci_sysfs_init initcall, this initcall essentially does=20
nothing, no devices or busses to iterate. Which means the complete pcie sys=
fs=20
creation is done from bridge probe path. There is no reason to iterate over=
=20
discovered PCIe devices/busses separately.

I assume this issue is not that prominent, if at all, as other platforms va=
ry=20
in speed a lot. I was not able to reproduce on i.MX8MP which uses the same=
=20
PCIe bridge driver. Due to improved speed performance, I guess on this=20
platform pci_sysfs_init finishes, without doing anything, before PCIe bridg=
e=20
is probed.

I might be missing something (ACPI systems, etc.), I do not know the detail=
s=20
within pci subsystem, but from my point of view this initcall is superfluou=
s.

Is there such an dependency in the first place? I can't see anything, even =
the=20
late_initcall to pci_resource_alignment_sysfs_init is a different matter.
