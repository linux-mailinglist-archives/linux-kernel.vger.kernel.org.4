Any luck getting the wireshark trace? I don't have access to the
Odroid HC1 board, so all my attempts at reproducing the problem have
been with qemu & libvirt, which doesn't seem to be hitting this issue.

I was also wondering if it would be possible to turn on KASAN in your
kernel, which should give us a little more info?

Thanks,
Anna
