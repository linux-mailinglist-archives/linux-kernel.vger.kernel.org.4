This series comprises two related fixes:

- the FILL_RETURN_BUFFER macro in -next needs to access percpu data,
  hence the GS segment base needs to be loaded before FILL_RETURN_BUFFER.
  This means moving guest vmload/vmsave and host vmload to assembly
  (patches 5 and 6).

- because AMD wants the OS to set STIBP to 1 before executing the
  return thunk (un)training sequence, IA32_SPEC_CTRL must be restored
  before UNTRAIN_RET, too.  This must also be moved to assembly and,
  for consistency, the guest SPEC_CTRL is also loaded in there
  (patch 7).

Neither is particularly hard, however because of 32-bit systems one needs
to keep the number of arguments to __svm_vcpu_run to three or fewer.
One is taken for whether IA32_SPEC_CTRL is intercepted, and one for the
host save area, so all accesses to the vcpu_svm struct have to be done
from assembly too.  This is done in patches 2 to 4, and it turns out
not to be that bad; in fact I think the code is simpler than before
after these prerequisites, and even at the end of the series it is not
much harder to follow despite doing a lot more stuff.  Care has been
taken to keep the "normal" and SEV-ES code as similar as possible,
even though the latter would not hit the three argument barrier.

The above summary leaves out the more mundane patches 1 and 8.  The
former introduces a separate asm-offsets.c file for KVM, so that
kernel/asm-offsets.c does not have to do ugly includes with ../ paths.
The latter is dead code removal.

Thanks,

Paolo

v1->v2: use a separate asm-offsets.c file instead of hacking around
	the arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.h file; this could have been done
	also with just a "#ifndef COMPILE_OFFSETS", but Sean's
	suggestion is cleaner and there is a precedent in
	drivers/memory/ for private asm-offsets files

	keep preparatory cleanups together at the beginning of the
	series

	move SPEC_CTRL save/restore out of line [Jim]

Paolo Bonzini (8):
  KVM: x86: use a separate asm-offsets.c file
  KVM: SVM: replace regs argument of __svm_vcpu_run with vcpu_svm
  KVM: SVM: adjust register allocation for __svm_vcpu_run
  KVM: SVM: retrieve VMCB from assembly
  KVM: SVM: move guest vmsave/vmload to assembly
  KVM: SVM: restore host save area from assembly
  KVM: SVM: move MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL save/restore to assembly
  x86, KVM: remove unnecessary argument to x86_virt_spec_ctrl and
    callers
