+----------
+Motivation
+----------
+
+There are a few existing ways to dump kernel data into user space. The most
+popular one is the ``/proc`` system. For example, ``cat /proc/net/tcp6`` d=
umps
+all tcp6 sockets in the system, and ``cat /proc/net/netlink`` dumps all ne=
tlink
+sockets in the system. However, their output format tends to be fixed, and=
 if
+users want more information about these sockets, they have to patch the ke=
rnel,
+which often takes time to publish upstream and release. The same is true f=
or popular
+tools like `ss <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ss.8.html>`_ where a=
ny
+additional information needs a kernel patch.
+
+To solve this problem, the `drgn
+<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/drgn.html>`_ tool is often use=
d to
+dig out the kernel data with no kernel change. However, the main drawback =
for
+drgn is performance, as it cannot do pointer tracing inside the kernel. In
+addition, drgn cannot validate a pointer value and may read invalid data i=
f the
+pointer becomes invalid inside the kernel.
+
+The BPF iterator solves the above problem by providing flexibility on what=
 data
+(e.g., tasks, bpf_maps, etc.) to collect by calling BPF programs for each =
kernel
+data object.
+
+----------------------
+How BPF Iterators Work
+----------------------
+
+A BPF iterator is a type of BPF program that allows users to iterate over
+specific types of kernel objects. Unlike traditional BPF tracing programs =
that
+allow users to define callbacks that are invoked at particular points of
+execution in the kernel, BPF iterators allow users to define callbacks that
+should be executed for every entry in a variety of kernel data structures.
+
+For example, users can define a BPF iterator that iterates over every task=
 on
+the system and dumps the total amount of CPU runtime currently used by eac=
h of
+them. Another BPF task iterator may instead dump the cgroup information fo=
r each
+task. Such flexibility is the core value of BPF iterators.
+
+A BPF program is always loaded into the kernel at the behest of a user spa=
ce
+process. A user space process loads a BPF program by opening and initializ=
ing
+the program skeleton as required and then invoking a syscall to have the B=
PF
+program verified and loaded by the kernel.
+
+In traditional tracing programs, a program is activated by having user spa=
ce
+obtain a ``bpf_link`` to the program with ``bpf_program__attach()``. Once
+activated, the program callback will be invoked whenever the tracepoint is
+triggered in the main kernel. For BPF iterator programs, a ``bpf_link`` to=
 the
+program is obtained using ``bpf_link_create()``, and the program callback =
is
+invoked by issuing system calls from user space.
+
+Next, let us see how you can use the iterators to iterate on kernel object=
s and
+read data.
+
+------------------------
+How to Use BPF iterators
+------------------------
+
+BPF selftests are a great resource to illustrate how to use the iterators.=
 In
+this section, we=E2=80=99ll walk through a BPF selftest which shows how to=
 load and use
+a BPF iterator program.   To begin, we=E2=80=99ll look at `bpf_iter.c
+<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/tree/too=
ls/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/bpf_iter.c>`_,
+which illustrates how to load and trigger BPF iterators on the user space =
side.
+Later, we=E2=80=99ll look at a BPF program that runs in kernel space.
+
+Loading a BPF iterator in the kernel from user space typically involves the
+following steps:
+
+* The BPF program is loaded into the kernel through ``libbpf``. Once the k=
ernel
+  has verified and loaded the program, it returns a file descriptor (fd) t=
o user
+  space.
+* Obtain a ``link_fd`` to the BPF program by calling the ``bpf_link_create=
()``
+  specified with the BPF program file descriptor received from the kernel.
+* Next, obtain a BPF iterator file descriptor (``bpf_iter_fd``) by calling=
 the
+  ``bpf_iter_create()`` specified with the ``bpf_link`` received from Step=
 2.
+* Trigger the iteration by calling ``read(bpf_iter_fd)`` until no data is
+  available.
+* Close the iterator fd using ``close(bpf_iter_fd)``.
+* If needed to reread the data, get a new ``bpf_iter_fd`` and do the read =
again.
+
+The following are a few examples of selftest BPF iterator programs:
+
+* `bpf_iter_tcp4.c <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bp=
f-next.git/tree/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/bpf_iter_tcp4.c>`_
+* `bpf_iter_task_vma.c <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bp=
f/bpf-next.git/tree/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/bpf_iter_task_vma.c>`_
+* `bpf_iter_task_file.c <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/b=
pf/bpf-next.git/tree/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/bpf_iter_task_file.c=
>`_
+
+Let us look at ``bpf_iter_task_file.c``, which runs in kernel space:
+
+Here is the definition of ``bpf_iter__task_file`` in `vmlinux.h
+<https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf-portability-=
and-co-re.html#btf>`_.
+Any struct name in ``vmlinux.h`` in the format ``bpf_iter__<iter_name>``
+represents a BPF iterator. The suffix ``<iter_name>`` represents the type =
of
+iterator.
+
+::
+
+    struct bpf_iter__task_file {
+            union {
+                struct bpf_iter_meta *meta;
+            };
+            union {
+                struct task_struct *task;
+            };
+            u32 fd;
+            union {
+                struct file *file;
+            };
+    };
+
+In the above code, the field 'meta' contains the metadata, which is the sa=
me for
+all BPF iterator programs. The rest of the fields are specific to different
+iterators. For example, for task_file iterators, the kernel layer provides=
 the
+'task', 'fd' and 'file' field values. The 'task' and 'file' are `reference
+counted
+<https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2018/08/31/object-lifetime.=
html#file-descriptors-and-reference-counters>`_,
+so they won't go away when the BPF program runs.
+
+Here is a snippet from the  ``bpf_iter_task_file.c`` file:
+
+::
+
+  SEC("iter/task_file")
+  int dump_task_file(struct bpf_iter__task_file *ctx)
+  {
+    struct seq_file *seq =3D ctx->meta->seq;
+    struct task_struct *task =3D ctx->task;
+    struct file *file =3D ctx->file;
+    __u32 fd =3D ctx->fd;
+
+    if (task =3D=3D NULL || file =3D=3D NULL)
+      return 0;
+
+    if (ctx->meta->seq_num =3D=3D 0) {
+      count =3D 0;
+      BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "    tgid      gid       fd      file\n");
+    }
+
+    if (tgid =3D=3D task->tgid && task->tgid !=3D task->pid)
+      count++;
+
+    if (last_tgid !=3D task->tgid) {
+      last_tgid =3D task->tgid;
+      unique_tgid_count++;
+    }
+
+    BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "%8d %8d %8d %lx\n", task->tgid, task->pid, fd,
+            (long)file->f_op);
+    return 0;
+  }
+
+In the above example, the section name ``SEC(iter/task_file)``, indicates =
that
+the program is a BPF iterator program to iterate all files from all tasks.=
 The
+context of the program is ``bpf_iter__task_file`` struct.
+
+The user space program invokes the BPF iterator program running in the ker=
nel
+by issuing a ``read()`` syscall. Once invoked, the BPF
+program can export data to user space using a variety of BPF helper functi=
ons.
+You can use either ``bpf_seq_printf()`` (and BPF_SEQ_PRINTF helper macro) =
or
+``bpf_seq_write()`` function based on whether you need formatted output or=
 just
+binary data, respectively. For binary-encoded data, the user space applica=
tions
+can process the data from ``bpf_seq_write()`` as needed. For the formatted=
 data,
+you can use ``cat <path>`` to print the results similar to ``cat
+/proc/net/netlink`` after pinning the BPF iterator to the bpffs mount. Lat=
er,
+use  ``rm -f <path>`` to remove the pinned iterator.
+
+For example, you can use the following command to create a BPF iterator fr=
om the
+``bpf_iter_ipv6_route.o`` object file and pin it to the ``/sys/fs/bpf/my_r=
oute``
+path:
+
+::
+
+  $ bpftool iter pin ./bpf_iter_ipv6_route.o  /sys/fs/bpf/my_route
+
+And then print out the results using the following command:
+
+::
+
+  $ cat /sys/fs/bpf/my_route
+
+
+-------------------------------------------------------
+Implement Kernel Support for BPF Iterator Program Types
+-------------------------------------------------------
+
+To implement a BPF iterator in the kernel, the developer must make a one-t=
ime
+change to the following key data structure defined in the `bpf.h
+<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/tree/inc=
lude/linux/bpf.h>`_
+file.
+
+::
+
+  struct bpf_iter_reg {
+            const char *target;
+            bpf_iter_attach_target_t attach_target;
+            bpf_iter_detach_target_t detach_target;
+            bpf_iter_show_fdinfo_t show_fdinfo;
+            bpf_iter_fill_link_info_t fill_link_info;
+            bpf_iter_get_func_proto_t get_func_proto;
+            u32 ctx_arg_info_size;
+            u32 feature;
+            struct bpf_ctx_arg_aux ctx_arg_info[BPF_ITER_CTX_ARG_MAX];
+            const struct bpf_iter_seq_info *seq_info;
+  };
+
+After filling the data structure fields, call ``bpf_iter_reg_target()`` to
+register the iterator to the main BPF iterator subsystem.
+
+The following is the breakdown for each field in struct ``bpf_iter_reg``.
+
+.. list-table::
+   :widths: 25 50
+   :header-rows: 1
+
+   * - Fields
+     - Description
+   * - target
+     - Specifies the name of the BPF iterator. For example: ``bpf_map``,
+       ``bpf_map_elem``. The name should be different from other ``bpf_ite=
r`` target names in the kernel.
+   * - attach_target and detach_target
+     - Allows for target specific ``link_create`` action since some targets

+
+---------------------------------
+Parameterizing BPF Task Iterators
+---------------------------------
+
+By default, BPF iterators walk through all the objects of the specified ty=
pes
+(processes, cgroups, maps, etc.) across the entire system to read relevant
+kernel data. But often, there are cases where we only care about a much sm=
aller
+subset of iterable kernel objects, such as only iterating tasks within a
+specific process. Therefore, BPF iterator programs support filtering out o=
bjects
+from iteration by allowing user space to configure the iterator program wh=
en it
+is attached.
+
+--------------------------
+BPF Task Iterator Program
+--------------------------
+
+The following code is a BPF iterator program to print files and task infor=
mation
+through the ``seq_file`` of the iterator. It is a standard BPF iterator pr=
ogram
+that visits every file of an iterator. We will use this BPF program in our
+example later.
+
+::
+
+  #include <vmlinux.h>
+  #include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>
+
+  char _license[] SEC("license") =3D "GPL";
+
+  SEC("iter/task_file")
+  int dump_task_file(struct bpf_iter__task_file *ctx)
+  {
+        struct seq_file *seq =3D ctx->meta->seq;
+        struct task_struct *task =3D ctx->task;
+        struct file *file =3D ctx->file;
+        __u32 fd =3D ctx->fd;
+        if (task =3D=3D NULL || file =3D=3D NULL)
+                return 0;
+        if (ctx->meta->seq_num =3D=3D 0) {
+                BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "    tgid      pid       fd      file\=
n");
+        }
+        BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "%8d %8d %8d %lx\n", task->tgid, task->pid, fd,
+                        (long)file->f_op);
+        return 0;
+  }
+
+----------------------------------------
+Creating a File Iterator with Parameters
+----------------------------------------
+
+Now, let us look at how to create an iterator that includes only files of a
+process.
+
+First,  fill the ``bpf_iter_attach_opts`` struct as shown below:
+
+::
+
+  LIBBPF_OPTS(bpf_iter_attach_opts, opts);
+  union bpf_iter_link_info linfo;
+  memset(&linfo, 0, sizeof(linfo));
+  linfo.task.pid =3D getpid();
+  opts.link_info =3D &linfo;
+  opts.link_info_len =3D sizeof(linfo);
+
+``linfo.task.pid``, if it is non-zero, directs the kernel to create an ite=
rator
+that only includes opened files for the process with the specified ``pid``=
. In
+this example, we will only be iterating files for our process. If
+``linfo.task.pid`` is zero, the iterator will visit every opened file of e=
very
+process. Similarly, ``linfo.task.tid`` directs the kernel to create an ite=
rator
+that visits opened files of a specific thread, not a process. In this exam=
ple,
+``linfo.task.tid`` is different from ``linfo.task.pid`` only if the thread=
 has a
+separate file descriptor table. In most circumstances, all process threads=
 share
+a single file descriptor table.
+
+Now, in the userspace program, pass the pointer of struct to the
+``bpf_program__attach_iter()``.
+
+::
+
+  link =3D bpf_program__attach_iter(prog, &opts); iter_fd =3D
+  bpf_iter_create(bpf_link__fd(link));
+
+If both *tid* and *pid* are zero, an iterator created from this struct
+``bpf_iter_attach_opts`` will include every opened file of every task in t=
he
+system (in the namespace, actually.) It is the same as passing a NULL as t=
he
+second argument to ``bpf_program__attach_iter()``.
+
+The whole program looks like the following code:
+
+::

+------------------
+Without Parameters
+------------------
+
+Let us look at how a BPF iterator without parameters skips files of other
+processes in the system. In this case, the BPF program has to check the pi=
d or
+the tid of tasks, or it will receive every opened file in the system (in t=
he
+current *pid* namespace, actually). So, we usually add a global variable i=
n the
+BPF program to pass a *pid* to the BPF program.
+
+The BPF program would look like the following block.
+
+  ::
+
+    ......
+    int target_pid =3D 0;
+
+    SEC("iter/task_file")
+    int dump_task_file(struct bpf_iter__task_file *ctx)
+    {
+          ......
+          if (task->tgid !=3D target_pid) /* Check task->pid instead to ch=
eck thread IDs */
+                  return 0;
+          BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "%8d %8d %8d %lx\n", task->tgid, task->pid, =
fd,
+                          (long)file->f_op);
+          return 0;
+    }
+
+The user space program would look like the following block:
+
+  ::
+
+    ......
+    static void test_task_file(void)
+    {
+          ......
+          skel =3D bpf_iter_task_ex__open_and_load();
+          if (skel =3D=3D NULL)
+                  return;
+          skel->bss->target_pid =3D getpid(); /* process ID.  For thread i=
d, use gettid() */
+          memset(&linfo, 0, sizeof(linfo));
+          linfo.task.pid =3D getpid();
+          opts.link_info =3D &linfo;
+          opts.link_info_len =3D sizeof(linfo);
+          ......
+    }
+
+``target_pid`` is a global variable in the BPF program. The user space pro=
gram
+should initialize the variable with a process ID to skip opened files of o=
ther
+processes in the BPF program. When you parametrize a BPF iterator, the ite=
rator
+calls the BPF program fewer times which can save significant resources.
+
+---------------------------
+Parametrizing VMA Iterators
+---------------------------
+
+By default, a BPF VMA iterator includes every VMA in every process.  Howev=
er,
+you can still specify a process or a thread to include only its VMAs. Unli=
ke
+files, a thread can not have a separate address space (since Linux 2.6.0-t=
est6).
+Here, using *tid* makes no difference from using *pid*.
+
+----------------------------
+Parametrizing Task Iterators
+----------------------------
+
+A BPF task iterator with *pid* includes all tasks (threads) of a process. =
The
+BPF program receives these tasks one after another. You can specify a BPF =
task
+iterator with *tid* parameter to include only the tasks that match the giv=
en
+*tid*.
