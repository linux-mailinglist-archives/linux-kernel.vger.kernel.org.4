We would then need FILL_RETURN_BUFFER to unconditionally execute LFENCE
to account for wrmsr branch misprediction. Currently LFENCE is not
executed for !X86_BUG_EIBRS_PBRSB.

Note:

  VMexit
  CALL
    RET
  RET    <---- This is also a problem if the first call hasn't retired yet.
  LFENCE

Converting vmx_spec_ctrl_restore_host() to ASM should be able to take care
of this.
