I see. But I do not agree with this assumption. The new livepatch
might also remove code that caused problems.

Also we allow downgrades. I mean that there is no versioning
of livepatches. Older livepatches might replace new ones.

We really want to support downgrades or upgrades that remove
problematic code. Or upgrades that start fixing the problem
a better way using another shadow variable.

I personally think that registering the supported klp_shadow_types
is worth the effort. It allows to do various changes a safe way.

Also it should be easy to make sure that all klp_shadow_types
are registered:

1. Grep might be used to find declarations in the source code.
   IMHO, it should work even with kPatch.

2. The klp_shadow_*() API will warn when a non-registered shadow
   variable is used. IMHO, this might be useful and catch some bugs
   on its own.

Best Regards,
Petr
