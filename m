Basically, we only pull branches to drm-tip that are managed using our
tools and our development model and under our control. It was too much
trouble dealing with conflicts, Linus' master being pulled in at random
points (like in the middle of the merge window), and stuff like that,
with the external trees.

Yeah, we need to pay more attention to linux-next test results, as well
as Linus' master during the merge window. It's not necessarily easy with
the volatility of linux-next, you could easily have very broken runs
followed by good ones, but the low hanging fruit is raising more flags
and being louder about it earlier when everything's busted for several
days in linux-next or Linus' master.
