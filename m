Yes. But it is important to consider who those users are. We are
draining when
	- we are charging and the limit is hit so that memory reclaim
	  has to be triggered.
	- hard, high limits are set and require memory reclaim.
	- force_empty - full memory reclaim for a memcg
	- memcg offlining - cgroup removel - quite a heavy operation as
	  well.
all those could be really costly kernel operations and they affect
isolated cpu only if the same memcg is used by both isolated and non-isolated
cpus. In other words those costly operations would have to be triggered
from non-isolated cpus and those are to be expected to be stalled. It is
the side effect of the local cpu draining that is scheduled that affects
the isolated cpu as well.

Is that more clear?
