The idea here would be to return a dynamically allocated object with an
initial refcount of 1 that's owned by the _BPF program_, rather than
what we have today where the global struct has an initial refcount
that's owned by the main kernel and is never expected to go to 0. For
all success (i.e. non-fail) testcases that are able to dynamically
allocate this object, the refcount should go to 0 for each of them and
the object will be destroyed after the current RCU grace period. Please
let me know if I've misunderstood your point.

Right, a warning would probably show up if we did a release that caused
an underflow, but it would not for an acquire after the refcount dropped
to 0.

Ok, let me update the tests to do two things then:

1. Add a new test kfunc called bpf_kfunc_call_test_alloc() which returns
   a dynamically allocated instance of a prog_test_ref_kfunc *. This is
   similar in intention to bpf_xdp_ct_alloc().
2. Update bpf_kfunc_call_test_acquire() and
   bpf_kfunc_call_test_release() to take a trusted pointer to that
   allocated prog_test_ref_kfunc *.
3. Keep the other changes which e.g. use RCU in
   bpf_kfunc_call_test_kptr_get() to synchronize on getting the kptr.
   Once the __rcu kptr variant is landed we can get rid of
   bpf_kfunc_call_test_kptr_get() and make bpf_kfunc_call_test_acquire()
   require an __rcu pointer.

Continuing on point (3) above, we should _probably_ also have an example
for an object that isn't RCU-protected? I imagine that we don't want to
get rid of KF_KPTR_GET entirely once we have __rcu pointers because some
kptr_get() implementations may synchronize in other ways, such as with
spinlocks or whatever. Let's leave this until after __rcu lands though.

Does this all sound good?

For sure, can do.
