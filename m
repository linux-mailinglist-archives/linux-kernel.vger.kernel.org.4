I'm sorry, there were a lot of typos.
Let me try again:

Thank you for diving into this logic.

Although this patch only tosses the code and doens't make any functional
changes, I guess if the fix for the used cpu id is required, it has to
be in a separated patch.

Would you mind to elaborate more of the problem(s)?
Do you mean that the result of cpumask_first_and has to be checked for not
being >= nr_cpus_ids?
Or do you mean that there is no need to check the irq affinity against
cpu_online_mask at all and we can simply take any first bit from the
effective affinity mask?

Also, could you elaborate more on the disabled vector targeting an
offline CPU? Is there any use case for such scenario (in this case we
might want to support it)?

I guess the goal of this code is to make sure that hypervisor won't be
configured to deliver an MSI to an offline CPU.
