I sort of agree.  Use of run time overlays has been narrowly supported
for use by a limited set of very cautious developers in a very constrained
usage.

Yes, to the dynamic DT comments.

When the run time overlay code was added the overlay code used the existing
dynamic DT code as a foundation but did not address the architectural
issues that are exposed by using the dynamic DT code in a less constrained
manner.
