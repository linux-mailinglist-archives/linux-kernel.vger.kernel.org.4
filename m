What I meant is if the hardware designer thought there could be a 
problem with the thermal zone they would have put another kind of 
sensor, not one with a i2c based communication.

I meant the i2c sensors are under the hwmon subsystem. This subsystem is 
connected with the thermal framework, so when a hwmon sensor is created, 
it register this sensor as a thermal zone.

Not really, it shows the i2c sensors are in the hwmon subsystems.

Yes, please. Can you give examples with existing drivers in the thermal 
framework and observed issues on specific platforms ? Numbers would help.

Before that, you have to prove the feature is really needed and show how 
the patches solves an issue. At this point, this is not demonstrated.
