Ah, so you use gpio_export_link() to provide the well known name?

Ironically, the usual complaint wrt power/reset lines is that users
don't want it to be reset back to default when their app crashes.

What happens when the line is released is driver dependent.
The uAPI can't make any guarantees, as it releases the line back to the
device driver. Typically is it set back to its default state, so that
might do exactly what you want out of the box - no ExecStopPost required.
But you would need to confirm on your hardware.

There was also some discussion on making the default state configurable
via dts[1], but I'm not sure what happened to that.

Given appropriate line names, that is already something you can do with
the libgpiod v2 tools.  Something like:

`for x in gpiochip*; do gpioset -c x tx-dis=1; done`

Behind the scenes gpioset is doing the name to offset mapping, which is
less efficent than identifying the line by offset, but given you are
calling from shell performance probably isn't an issue.

Strictly speaking you have regression testing to deal with which ever
way you go. Though wouldn't regression testing for a kernel change be more
work than the app alone?
