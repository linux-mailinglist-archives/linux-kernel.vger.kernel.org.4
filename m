From: Roberto Sassu <roberto.sassu@huawei.com>

Ensure that for non-void LSM hooks there is a description of the return
values. Also replace spaces with tab for indentation, remove empty lines
between the hook description and the list of parameters and add the period
at the end of the parameter description.

Finally, replace the description of the sb_parse_opts_str hook, which was
removed with commit 757cbe597fe8 ("LSM: new method: ->sb_add_mnt_opt()"),
with one for the new hook sb_add_mnt_opt.
