I'll take the cost of a single

	cmpl    %edi, %edx

for a handful of entries any day of the week.

$ grep "memmove size" /tmp/mtrr.txt
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0
memmove size 0

for - I admit a largely contrived map - but 5 entries only:

Current map:
0: start: 0x0000000000000000, end: 0x0000000000100000, type: 0x0
1: start: 0x0000000100000000, end: 0x0000000820000000, type: 0x6

That's not what I meant. Please read again what I said:

"I wouldn't want it getting prefetched from %rsi in the hw when there's
no reason for it".

IOW, I don't want to put invalid values in hw registers if I can. Think
hw mitigations and *very* hungry prefetchers.

Type 0 is MTRR_TYPE_UNCACHABLE, 1 is MTRR_TYPE_WRCOMB.

"Uncacheable (UC)â€”Reads from, and writes to, UC memory are not cacheable. Reads from UC
memory cannot be speculative. Write-combining to UC memory is not
allowed."

That last sentence.

So if you have conflicting regions and one is WC but then something is
expecting it to be UC and that something doesn't want for it to
*especially* to be WC because it should not combine writes to it, then
that clearly is a misconfiguration, I'd say.

So are we fixing this right or only a little?

I'm thinking considering how often we've seen all those error messages
from mtrr_state_warn(), we should at least warn when we encounter
inconsistencies.

This won't help with released BIOSes but it will help when they do new
BIOS verification and see those messages. People do use Linux for that
a lot and then they'll definitely look and address them.

And this is a pretty good goal to have, IMO.

Thx.
