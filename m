So I just got the requested dmesg in BIOS CSM mode from:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1868899

And it says:

[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000004bc50000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved
[    0.316140] pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x65400000-0xbfffffff window]

So I'm afraid that I remembered correctly and the CSM adds
the EfiMemoryMappedIO regions to the E820 map as reserved :(

So as you said, this series won't help for people booting in
BIOS compatibility mode. Which means that we should at least keep
the current list of no_e820 quirks to avoid regressing those models
when booted in BIOS compatibility mode.

And maybe still add at least the Clevo model for which I recently
submitted a new no_e820 quirk so that that will work in BIOS CSM
mode too ?

Note I know you did not propose to drop the quirks in this series,
just covering all the bases here.

Regards,

Hans
