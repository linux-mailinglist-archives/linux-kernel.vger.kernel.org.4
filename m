I take it you mean in the case that the host's certs_len == 0?

A request that gets SNP_GUEST_REQ_INVALID_LEN when the guest expects
that it is providing a sufficiently sized certificate buffer means
that the guest has encrypted its report request.
We then have a harder problem than throttling because not only do we
have to reissue the same request, it must be with different
certificate arguments provided from user space.

Yes, the throttled caller gets -EAGAIN, and other ioctls other than
retry after that get -EBUSY.

I think that constitutes a change to task_struct, the way that there's
a buffer for interrupted system calls.
That seems a bit much. Do we have to model for protocol-breaking user
tasks that have access to /dev/sev-guest?
The caller that gets -EAGAIN knows to retry. There's no reason for
other tasks to retry due to command serialization and the -EBUSY
behavior.
