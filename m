"nVMX" instead of "vmx/nested"

Nah, it's just a boneheaded bug.

The CPUID thing is a red herring.  That's an _additional_ restriction, KVM honors
MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 when configuring vmcs01.  See adjust_vmx_controls()
for secondary controls in setup_vmcs_config().

It's not "copied", KVM sets the bit in the nVMX MSR irrespective of host support,
which is the problem.

Avoid referencing sections/tables by "number" in comments (and changelogs), as the
comment is all but guaranteed to become stale because future versions of the SDM
will shift things around.

The slightly more robust way to reference a specific SDM/APM section is to use the
title, e.g. According to section "Secondary Processor-Based VM-Execution Controls"
in Intel's SDM ...", as hardware vendors are less likely to arbitrarily rename
sections and tables.  It's a bit more work for readers, but any decent PDF viewer
can search these days.

> Intel System Programming Guide

KVM typically uses "Intel's SDM" (and "AMD's APM").  Like "VMX" or "SVM", it's ok
to use the SDM acronym without introducing since "SDM" is

Avoid pronouns in comments.  "we" and "us" are ambiguous, e.g. "we" can mean KVM,
the developer, the user, etc...

As a general rule, if you find yourself writing a comment and a helper for
something that KVM absolutely needs to get right (honoring VMX MSRs), then odds
are very good that there's a simpler/easier fix, i.e. that you're effectively
re-inventing part of the weel.

The issue here is that I, who wrote this code long, long ago, copied the pattern
used for enable_unrestricted_guest, flexpriority_enabled, etc... without fully
appreciating the logic.  Unlike those module params, enable_sgx doesn't track
hardware support, i.e. enable_sgx isn't cleared when SGX can't be enabled due to
lack of hardware support.  As a result, KVM effectively enumerates to L1 that the
control is always available, i.e. that KVM emulates ENCLS-exiting for L1, but KVM
obviously doesn't actually emulating the behavior.

Not updating enable_sgx is responsible for a second bug: vmx_set_cpu_caps() doesn't
clear the SGX bits when hardware support is unavailable.  This is a much less
problematic bug as as it only pops up if SGX is soft-disabled (the case being
handled by cpu_has_sgx()) or if SGX is supported for bare metal but not in the
VMCS (will never happen when running on bare metal, but can theoertically happen
when running in a VM).

Last but not least, KVM should ideally have module params reflect KVM's actual
configuration.

Killing all birds with one stone, simply clear enable_sgx when ENCLS-exiting isn't
supported.  The #ifdef is a little gross, but I think it's marginally less ugly
than having vmx.c define a dummy boolean.

Compile tested only...
