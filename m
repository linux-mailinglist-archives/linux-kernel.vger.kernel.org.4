Yaeh, as Jason noted, the fix in 6.1 probably covered only the most common
race scenario, yet other(s) were still possible, just more rare. So most
likely I just happened not to trigger it anymore with 6.1, only after
switching to 6.2 - but it's not really a new bug in 6.2. And 6.1 also only
started to exhibit it because hwrng started using the tpm, which would just
sit unused before that.
