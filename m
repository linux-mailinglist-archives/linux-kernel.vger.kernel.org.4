OK, I am not going to argue about this. But what about at least not using an inhibit
bit for that but something else like a boolean, or maybe really add 'I am AVIC bit'
or rather something like vcpu->arch.apicv_type enum?


Or we can make SVM code just call a common function - just put these in a function and call it
from avic_set_virtual_apic_mode?


void kvm_disable_apicv_memslot(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
	if (!vcpu->kvm->arch.apic_access_memslot_inhibited) {
            vcpu->kvm->arch.apic_access_memslot_inhibited = true;
            kvm_make_request(KVM_REQ_UNBLOCK, vcpu);
	}
}

Ah, you added this in previous patch which I didn't see, makes sense.

Yep, a WARN_ON_ONCE unless in hot path, is almost always a good idea, so lets add it.

Roger that!
And I guess lets rename it while we are at it.

Why though? the KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE is only handled AFAIK in vcpu_enter_guest
which drops the srcu lock few lines afterwards, and therefore the
kvm_vcpu_update_apicv is always called with the lock held and it means that it
can drop it for the duration of slot update.

The original issue we had was that we tried to drop the srcu lock in 
'kvm_set_apicv_inhibit' which indeed is called from various places,
with, or without the lock held.

Moving the memslot disable code to kvm_vcpu_update_apicv would actually solve that,
but it was not possible because kvm_vcpu_update_apicv is called simultaneously on all vCPUs, 
and created various races, including toggling the memslot twice.


So if possible please take another look at using KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE instead of KVM_REQ_UNBLOCK.
