Given that you said "we can collect data and perform error recovery" if the
suspend-resume takes more/less time than expected.  I'm trying to understand

I see.  There is no EC changes.

Specifically, do you see any crashes, or premature events, or mal-functions
regarding to the measurement is not that accurate?

Also, we wouldn't want it to be LPC-specialized.  Please consider other
