Thanks for reminding me of kexec-tools. The complete image for booting a
new kernel was originally prepared in user space. With kernel lockdown,
all this code had to move into the kernel, adding a new syscall and lots
of complexity to build purgatory code, etc. Yet, this new implementation
in the kernel does not offer all features of kexec-tools, so both code
bases continue to exist and are happily diverging...

All right, AFAICS your idea is limited to relatively simple cases for
now. I mean, allowing kexec-tools to run in user space is not easily
possible when UID 0 is not trusted, because kexec needs to open various
files and make various other syscalls, which would require a complex LSM
policy. It looks technically possible to write one, but then the big
question is if it would be simpler to review and maintain than adding
more kexec-tools features to the kernel.

Anyway, I can sense a general desire to run less code in the most
privileged system environment. Robert's proposal is one of few that go
in this direction. What are the alternatives?
