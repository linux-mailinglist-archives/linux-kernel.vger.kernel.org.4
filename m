Thanks for the effort of detailed reply. It is very informative.

Hmm, Krill and Isaku, can you confirm that TDX doesn't need this?

I think it is a generic requirement that TDX/SNP are not expecting the
host to touch a private page either from the kernel or the userspace.

No, it doesn't cause problem for TDX as TDX doesn't need such callback.

Unlike SNP, which has (1 NPT + 1 RMP) and the enforced HW check is done by RMP, TDX has
two EPT(smiliar with NPT)s (1 shared + 1 private). Converting the memory attr is achieved
by zapping the mapping from one EPT and creating the mapping in the other one in the fault
when guest access the memory. The fault GPA will carry the "SHARED" bit (!C-BIT), so
KVM knows which EPT should be chosen for populating the mapping.

I was trying to figure out what should be the proper callback and at which layer it should
sit for achieving changing memory attr for both TDX/SNP. The current callback looks a little
bit hacky. Duplicate code pieces because of locks implies the SW structure might need to be
re-considered.

Yes, I was talking about the sequence above. I was confused of why changing
RMP requires a zapping-recreating flow of NPT in SNP.

In this case, an extra tlbflush would solve? Still, the unnecessary
zapping/recreating of mapping is not promising. I understand that the way
how this patch goes is probably to minimize the changes, but it would be
nice to focus more on what is really needed in a common path and abstract
and re-factor from there.

Can you elaborate more about how the lazy-pinning unpin path is connected
with the zapping here? So that I can dig more about it.

Selftest is a minor case, guess we deal with them via enabling a switch.
E.g. a prop in debugfs.

I see. rmp fault handler only deals with page size mismatch for now.

Besides the HW design, I guess one major purpose is to optimize the
booting time of VMs with large memory. Also, post migration can be another case.

Out of curiosity, What is the avg cost of RMUPDATE? Suppose it is an x86
instruction and not going through PSP firmware.

I was thinking that zapping of the mapping in EPT/NPT was required by TDX
while SNP might only need an RMP update + TLB flush. Thus, the abstraction
of the kvm_x86_ops.update_mem_attr should sit at this level. But let's
scratch this for now as I need to dig more about the lazy pinning stuff.

That sounds better. I am just little bit worried that update_mem_attr() will
end up as an SNP-only callback.

Yes.
