To be fair, most people tended to care more about memory footprint
than about security at the time. And I don't recall a lot of
enthusiasm in the Linux community either for rounding up kernel
sections so they could be mapped with W^X permissions. And without
PAE, all memory is executable anyway.

I take it this issue is triggered by the fact that i386 maps the EFI
runtime regions into the kernel page tables, and are therefore always
mapped, right? If anyone cares enough about this to go and fix it, we
could switch to the approach we use everywhere else, i.e., treat EFI
memory as user space mappings, and activate them only while a runtime
service is in progress.

But frankly, why would anyone still be running this? With the EFI
mixed mode support, only systems with CPUs that don't actually
implement long mode still need this, and I am skeptical that such
deployments would use recent kernels.
