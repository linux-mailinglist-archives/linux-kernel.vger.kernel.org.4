It's hard to tell what "The initial support of TDX guests" means.  I
*think* you mean "this series".  But, we try not to say "this blah" too
much, so just say this:

	To keep things simple, assume that all TDX-protected memory will
	comes page allocator.  Make sure all pages in the page allocator
	*are* TDX-usable memory.

First, this is a run-on sentence.  Second, it isn't really clear what
memblocks have to do with this or why you need to stash them off.
Please explain.

I really don't know what this is trying to say.

*How* and *why* does this module initialization failure occur?  How do
you implement it and why is it necessary?

Why does it need to be enhanced?  What's the problem?

I don't really like that comment.  It should first state its behavior
and assumptions, like:

	This check assumes that the start_pfn<->end_pfn range does not
	cross multiple tdx_memlist entries.

Only then should it describe why that is OK:

	A single memory hotplug even across mutliple memblocks (from
	which tdx_memlist entries are derived) is impossible.  ... then
	actually explain

This comment isn't quite right either.  There might actually be totally
TDX *compatible* memory here.  It just wasn't configured for use with TDX.

Shouldn't this be something more like:

'tdx_memlist' is written only once at boot and then is read-only, right?

It might be nice to mention that so that the lack of locking doesn't
look problematic.

Ahh, that's why we need to "shadow" the memblocks.  Can you add a
sentence on this to the changelog, please?

I didn't like this in the changelog either.  Try to make this "timeless"
rather than refer to what the support is today.  I gave you example text
above.

Oh, it actually uses the memory hotplug locking for list protection.
That's at least a bit subtle.  Please document that somewhere in the
functions that actually manipulate the list.

I think it's also worth saying something here about the high-level
effects of what's going on:

	Take a snapshot of the memory configuration (memblocks).  This
	snapshot will be used to enable TDX support for *this* memory
	configuration only.  Use a memory hotplug notifier to ensure
	that no other RAM can be added outside of this configuration.

That's it, right?

You would also be wise to have the folks who do a lot of memory hotplug
work today look at this sooner rather than later.  I _think_ what you
have here is OK, but I'm really rusty on the code itself.
