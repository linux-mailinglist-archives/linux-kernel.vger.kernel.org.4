Looking up 201007ef707a to see what ensuring system integrity means,
it prevents Memory Requests with PASID, which should always be routed
to the RC, from being mistakenly routed as peer-to-peer requests.

Thanks, this is exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for.  But my
understanding of ATS/PRI/PASID is weak, so I'm still working through
this.  Tell me when I say something wrong below...

In PCIe spec language, I think you're saying that a PCIe Function may
contain an ATC.  If the ATC Capability Enable bit is set, the Function
can issue Translation Requests.

The TA (aka IOMMU) will respond with a Translation Completion.  If the
Completion is a CplD, it contains the translated address and the
Function can store the entry in its ATC.  I assume the I/O page fault
case corresponds to a Cpl (with no data) meaning that the TA could not
translate the address.

If the TA doesn't have a mapping with the desired permissions, and the
Function's Page Request Capability Enable bit is set, it may issue a
Page Request Message.  It's up to the TA/IOMMU to make this message
visible to the OS, which can make the page resident, create an IOMMU
mapping, and enable a PRG Response Message.  After the Function
receives the PRG Response Message, it would issue another Translation
Request.

A Memory Request with an address that is not a P2P address, i.e., it
is not contained in any bridge aperture, will *always* be routed
toward the RC, won't it?  Isn't that the case regardless of whether
the address is translated or untranslated, and even regardless of ACS?

IIUC, ACS basically causes peer-to-peer requests to be routed upstream
instead of directly to the peer.

OK, reading this again, I realize that I just restated exactly what
you had already written, sorry about that.

> AMD GPU is one of those devices.

I guess you mean the AMD GPU has ATS, PRI, and PASID Capabilities?
And furthermore, that the GPU *always* uses Translated addresses with
PASID?

So I guess what's going on here is that if:

  - A device only uses PASID with Translated addresses, and 
  - those Translated addresses are never P2P addresses, then
  - those transactions will always be routed to the RC.  

And this applies even if there is no ACS or ACS doesn't support
PCI_ACS_RR and PCI_ACS_UF.

The black screen happens because ... ?

What can we include in the commit log to help people find this fix?  I
see these in the bugzilla:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 477 at drivers/pci/ats.c:251 pci_disable_pri+0x75/0x80
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 477 at drivers/pci/ats.c:419 pci_disable_pasid+0x45/0x50

(These look like defects in pdev_pri_ats_enable(), so really just
distractions)

I couldn't figure out the NULL pointer dereference.  I expected it to
be from a BUG() or similar in report_iommu_fault(), but I don't see
that.

Where is this special domain allocated?  I think the above tests for
*IOMMU* features (I assume "GTSup: Guest translations supported" and
"PPRSup: Peripheral page request support" based on the AMD IOMMU
spec).  It doesn't test that this is a GPU.

This change doesn't feel safe for all possible devices that have a
PASID Capability because we don't know whether they *always* use
Translated addresses with PASID TLPs.
