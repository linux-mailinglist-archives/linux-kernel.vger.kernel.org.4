Agreed, TDISP is more comprehensive, but also much more complex with
more moving parts that we don't really have yet.

Depending on your IOMMU design (+ related stuff) and interaction with
the secure guest, you might be able to block any rogue DMA until
after attestation / lock down checks even if the Hypervisor was letting
it through.

Cool. thanks for the reference.
