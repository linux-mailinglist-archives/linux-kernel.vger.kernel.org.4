Very happy that we have reached a consensus on #1.

For #2, neither returning 0 nor 7 will affect the behavior of interrupt handling in
the guest os. Because their Bit 7 are all 0, the guest os will interpret them as no
interrupt. However, keeping it as it is (return 7) will reduce the readability of
the pic_poll_read() code. When developers compare the code in kvm_pic_read_irq(),
they may think that what is returned in #2 is a spurious interrupt, but this is not.

For the reasons above, I suggest fix #2. I will split it to a separate patch.

Thank you.
