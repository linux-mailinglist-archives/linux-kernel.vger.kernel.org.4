It is kind of the other way around:

The mere fact of switching to vmcb02 *inhibits* the AVIC on the current vCPU,
but the AVIC inhibit is there only to set the is_running bits in the physid table
and in IOMMU to prevent its *peers* to try and send interrupts to it via AVIC.

It is the reason why APICv doesn't need it - the posted interrupts still work
just fine when a vCPU doens't use APICv, or uses a different posted interrupt vector
when it uses the nested APICv.

So it makes sense to remove that inhibit as soon as possible that the peers
could stop getting 'unaccellerated IPI' vmexits for nothing.


However back to the discussion, I don't think this is a problem.

We can just call both the kvm_vcpu_update_apicv() and a new function that
does the memslot disable from KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE, then 
plain kvm_vcpu_update_apicv() won't need to drop the srcu lock.

It is pretty much the same that you proposed, just instead of piggybacking on 
KVM_REQ_UNBLOCK, I proposed to piggyback on KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE.
