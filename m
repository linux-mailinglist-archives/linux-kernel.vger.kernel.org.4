Subject: [PATCH V6 0/6] coresight: etm4x: Migrate ACPI AMBA devices to platform driver

CoreSight ETM4x devices could be accessed either via MMIO (handled via
amba_driver) or CPU system instructions (handled via platform driver). But
this has the following issues :

  - Each new CPU comes up with its own PID and thus we need to keep on
    adding the "known" PIDs to get it working with AMBA driver. While
    the ETM4 architecture (and CoreSight architecture) defines way to
    identify a device as ETM4. Thus older kernels  won't be able to
    "discover" a newer CPU, unless we add the PIDs.

  - With ACPI, the ETM4x devices have the same HID to identify the device
    irrespective of the mode of access. This creates a problem where two
    different drivers (both AMBA based driver and platform driver) would
    hook into the "HID" and could conflict. e.g., if AMBA driver gets
    hold of a non-MMIO device, the probe fails. If we have single driver
    hooked into the given "HID", we could handle them seamlessly,
    irrespective of the mode of access.

  - CoreSight is heavily dependent on the runtime power management. With
    ACPI, amba_driver doesn't get us anywhere with handling the power
    and thus one need to always turn the power ON to use them. Moving to
    platform driver gives us the power management for free.

Due to all of the above, we are moving ACPI MMIO based etm4x devices to be
supported via tha platform driver. The series makes the existing platform
driver generic to handle both type of the access modes. Although existing
AMBA driver would still continue to support DT based etm4x MMIO devices.
Although some problems still remain, such as manually adding PIDs for all
new AMBA DT based devices.

The series applies on 6.5-rc1.
