Can we link directly to the libbpf overview page, rather than just
quoting it? To do that, you can create a label at the top of
libbpf_overview.rst with

.. _libbpf-overview-label:

and then link it from here with :ref`libbpf-overview-label`.

IMO this sentence reads kind of awkwardly because of the grammar and
punctuation. Wdyt about this:

A BPF application consists of one or more BPF programs (either
cooperating or completely independent), BPF maps, and global variables.
The global variables are shared between all BPF programs, which allows
them to cooperate on a common set of data.

There are quite a few sentences throughout that sound a bit like libbpf
marketing. IMO they just add noise to what's trying to be conveyed. I
think you can remove the whole "The APIs abstract away..." sentence. If
we want to go into details about what specific complexities are being
abstracted in a phase, we can do that when we explain the phase below.

> +libbpf APIs to trigger are listed below:

I don't think the libbpf APIs (e.g. bpf_object__ope()) really belong
here. This section (which is super useful) is describing the lifecycle
of a BPF program. This lifecycle applies regardless of whether you're
using bpf_object__open() or some other skeleton APIs.

Most users will also probably never use "core" APIs like
bpf_object__open() directly, so IMO if we're going to go over them, we
should just mention them briefly when we talk about skeletons to give a
bit more background on how things are implemented at a lower level.

Wdyt about rephrasing this last sentence as:

This is the phase during which BPF programs are performing useful work,
such as processing packets, or updating BPF maps and global variables
which can be read from user space.

I would suggest removing this sentence as well. It doesn't provide any
new information.

I think this paragraph can be improved. Describing how skeletons are
generated here is a bit premature. I think we need to first describe
what they are and why they're useful. I'd also argue that it's fair to
say that skeleton are the common / recommended APIs for manipulating BPF
applications from user space. If you agree that's the case, I'd suggest
mentioning that here as well, as the way it's worded now seems to imply
that bpf_object__open() and friends are the default / commonly used
APIs.

Misaligned title underscore (extra =). Also, can you add a #### above
the title as well to keep things consistent with the rest of the doc.
Lastly, there's a space missing between Skeleton and File.

"easily set up initial values of variables" is IMO kind of odd wording,
and is arguably a bit incomplete in terms of the scope it implies. What
about just "initialize BPF programs" (also removing the word 'easily').

"conveniently provides" -- Similar to my suggestions above, I recommend
removing such qualifiers. I'd remove this whole sentence, as I think
"BPF-side APIs that BPF programs can use" implies that there are
functions they can call.

Can we add an example of CO-RE in action here? I think showing a small
BPF program that accesses a kernel struct field which changes between
kernel versions would really drive the point home.

This reads like more marketing to me. I think most, if not all, of this
entire paragraph can arguably be removed.

I would rephrase "you are still expected to". Saying that users are
"expected to" do something a certain way implies that there are other
ways they _could_ do it, which is not the case. Perhaps something like
this is clearer: "Note, however, that the BPF the program themselves
must still be written in C."

I think the part about "utilizing all the BPF-side APIs" can be removed.
It's implied that the developer will have to use those C APIs if they're
writing their BPF programs in C.
