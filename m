I am fine with these two ways naming of the param. Adjusting from
enable_msi_remaping to disable_msi_bypass was aimed to trying address
your comment about dealing with the device not supporting bypass.
And in vmd drivers, the vmd bypass feature is enabled by adding the flag
"VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP".  Therefore, I think disabling
bypass seems more appropriate. This patch aims to provide a convenient
way to remove that flag in a specific case.

However, as you said, it does lead to some complicated logic.  So, I
also believe
that these two approaches have their own pros and cons.

What I mean is that there will be performance issues when a PCIe domain
is fully loaded with 4 Gen4 NVMe devices.  like this:
 +-[10002:00]-+-01.0-[01]----00.0  device0
 |                     +-03.0-[02]----00.0  device1
 |                     +-05.0-[03]----00.0  device2
 |                      \-07.0-[04]----00.0  device3

According to the perf/irqtop tool, we found the os does get the same counts
of interrupts in different modes. However, when the above situation occurs,
we observed a significant increase in CPU idle time. Besides, the data and
performance when using the bypass VMD feature were identical to when VMD
was disabled. And after the devices mounted on a domain are reduced, the
IOPS of individual devices will rebound somewhat. Therefore, we speculate
that VMD can play a role in balancing and buffering interrupt loads. Theref=
ore,
in this situation, we believe that VMD  ought to not be bypassed to handle =
MSI.

I apologize for the confusion, I think I missed the keyword 'passthrough mo=
de'.
In the virtualization scenarios, VMD doesn't support bypassing MSI-X when i=
t is
set to passthrough mode.
  PCI: vmd: Disable MSI-X remapping when possible(commit ee81ee8):
+  /*
+  * Currently MSI remapping must be enabled in guest passthrough mode
+  * due to some missing interrupt remapping plumbing. This is probably
+  * acceptable because the guest is usually CPU-limited and MSI
+  * remapping doesn't become a performance bottleneck.
+  */
This patch will not change this point, I just wanted to mention it again~

Thanks for your reviewing. I hope this reply can address your points.
