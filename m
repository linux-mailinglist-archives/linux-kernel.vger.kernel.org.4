I don't quite get what you mean. We've got some changes that are in
progress here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230111125323.1911373-1-daire.mcnamara@m=
icrochip.com/
We've been quiet there for a while, but Daire's back looking into Robin's
comments in there about the range parsing/window setup at the moment.

I'm not sure if that's what you mean though, since you said "common
bits" & Daire was doing that work in a world where there was no jh7110
driver in the mix.
Extracting common bits would be part of the process of adding a new
driver, as I don't think there's any real reason to do so without
another in-tree user.

Right. I'd expect there to be a fair difference between our integrations
of the IP, and therefore there'll be a bunch of non-shareable bits.

You need the stg,syscon & phy bits, and the clock/reset handling is
clearly different too.

rivers/pci/controller/pcie-plda.c

I had a bit of a read through this again today with Daire to check what
the differences actually are and it *looked* like the main,
non-implementation related, differences were the extra "event" domain
that was created to simplify the driver & the bottom half interrupt
handling.
That all came out of the review process, so it's likely that some of the
same requests would be made of you by the PCI maintainers anyway.

As an aside, you should probably run checkpatch --strict on this
submission, there's a rake of coding style "issues" in the new code
you've added.

Cheers,
Conor.
