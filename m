I disagree.  Failure to fetch should be fixed but is otherwise a red 
herring.  It's the whole memslot API (including dirty logging) that is a 
mess.

If you think we should overhaul it even more than just providing atomic 
batched updates, that's fine.  But still, the impossibility to perform 
atomic updates in batches *is* a suboptimal part of the KVM API.

>    - Why can't this be solved in userspace?

I don't think *can't* is the right word.  If the metric of choice was 
"what can be solved in userspace", we'd all be using microkernels.  The 
question is why userspace would be a better place to solve it.

The only reason to do it in userspace would be if failure to fetch is 
something that is interesting to userspace, other than between two 
KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION.  Unless you provide an API to pass failures 
to fetch down to userspace, the locking in userspace is going to be 
inferior, because it would have to be unconditional.  This means worse 
performance and more complication, not to mention having to do it N 
times instead of 1 for N implementations.

Not forcing userspace to do "tricks" is in my opinion a strong part of 
deciding whether an API belongs in KVM.

The main cases are:

- for the boot case, splitting and merging existing memslots.  QEMU 
likes to merge adjacent memory regions into a single memslot, so if 
something goes from read-write to read-only it has to be split and vice 
versa.  I guess a "don't merge this memory region" flag would be the 
less hideous way to solve it in userspace.

- however, there is also the case of resizing an existing memslot which 
is what David would like to have for virtio-mem.  This is not really 
fixable because part of the appeal of virtio-mem is to have a single 
huge memslot instead of many smaller ones, in order to reduce the 
granularity of add/remove (David, correct me if I'm wrong).

(The latter _would_ be needed by other VMMs).

I agree that the address space should be moved out of the single entries 
and into the header if we follow through with this approach.

(Heh, and I forgot likewise that non-x86 does not retry on 
KVM_MEMSLOT_INVALID.  Yes, that would be treated as a bug on other 
architectures).

Indeed; I would have thought that it is clear with the batch updates API 
(which requires the update to be split into delete and insert), but 
apparently it's not and it's by no means optimal.
