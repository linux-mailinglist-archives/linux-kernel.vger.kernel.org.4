Ok, thanks for pinpointing this. That series landed a long time ago ;).

So I'm curious. Do you have any workload that actually does these
synchronous random buffered IOs? Or is it just a benchmarking exercise?

OK, about 2% regression. How stable is that across multiple runs?

Yeah, probably.

So the change was intentional. When I was working on the series, I was
somewhat concerned that the old code could end up in a pathological
situation like:
  We scan range 0-1000000, find the only dirty page at index 0, return it.
  We scan range 1-1000000, find the only dirty page at index 1, return it.
  ...

This way we end up with rather inefficient scanning and in theory malicious
user could livelock writeback like this. That being said this was/is mostly
a theoretical concern.
