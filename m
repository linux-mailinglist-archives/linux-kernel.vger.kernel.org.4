IIUC, the reason why there is a convergence process on x86 is that x86's jmp
instruction length varies with the size of immediate part, so after immediate
part is adjusted, the instruction length may change accordingly, and consequently
cause the positions of subsequent instructions to change, which in turn causes
the distance between instructions to change. However, arm64's instruction size
is fixed to 4 bytes and does not change with immediate part changes. So adjusting
the immediate part of arm64 jump instruction does not result in a change in
instruction length or position.

For BPF_CALL, arguments passed to emit_call() and emit_a64_mov_i() (if called)
do not change in pass 3 and 4, so the jited result does not change. This is also
true for other non-BPF_JMP instructions.

So no convergence is required on arm64.
