I think this is only related to the page size, not to any
LoongArch-specific details.  If that's the case, I don't think the
change should be arch-specific.

I guess these BARs are from different devices, and the problem you're
pointing out is that both BARs end up in the same 16K page (actually
even the same 4K page):

  (gdb) p/x 0xe003526e800 >> 12
  $1 = 0xe003526e
  (gdb) p/x 0xe003526ec00 >> 12
  $2 = 0xe003526e

I agree that's a potential issue because a user mmap of the first
device also gets access to the BAR of the second device.  But it
doesn't seem to be a *new* or LoongArch-specific issue.

So I *think* the point of this patch is to ensure that BARs of
different devices never share a page.  Why is that suddenly an issue
for LoongArch?  Is it only because you see more sharing with 16K pages
than other arches do with 4K pages?

The minimum memory BAR per spec is 128 bytes (not 4K).  You just
demonstrated that even with 4K pages, different devices can share a
page.

Why is this under CONFIG_64BIT?  That doesn't have anything to do with
the BAR size.  The only reason I can see is that with CONFIG_64BIT=y,
we *might* have more MMIO space to use for BARs.
