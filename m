I see what you mean now, thanks.  That looks fine.  I just suspect the
pte_special trick will still be needed if this will start to apply to HGM,
as it seems to not suite perfectly with a large folio size, still.  The
MADV_DONTNEED worst case of having it loop over ~folio_size() times of none
pte is still possible.
