I wonder if mutex should actually prioritize giving the lock to RT tasks
instead of FIFO, since that's higher priority work. It sounds that's more
'fair'. But that's likely to make John's issue worse.

Agree, I was kind of hoping need_resched() in mutex_spin_on_owner() would
come to the rescue in such a scenario, but obviously not. Modifications to
check_preempt_curr_rt() could obviously aid there but...

True, but maybe the CFS task is happy to lose some bandwidth and get back to
CPU quickly, than blocking and not getting any work done. ;-)
