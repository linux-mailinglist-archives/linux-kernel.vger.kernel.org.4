We can certainly use PTE bits defined by Svpmbt extension to
differentiate between IO and memory. Also, we can use the PTE
SW bits to differentiate between shared and non-shared memory.

Performance wise both approaches will be the same because in
case of PTE based approach, the TSM can on-demand map the
shared memory and do software walk upon first access.

I think we should re-evaluate the PTE (or software walk) based approach
for CoVE spec. It is better to keep the CoVE spec as minimal as possible
and define SBI calls only if absolutely required.
