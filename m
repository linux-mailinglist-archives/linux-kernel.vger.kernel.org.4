So this patch was meant to go *after* the FRED patch set proper.

This patch does not change any of the system vectors except, by 
necessity, IRQ_MOVE_CLEANUP_VECTOR, nor does it change the way they are 
assigned to fixed vectors today.

It does make the lowest *non*-system vector a variable, but the system 
vectors are at the end.

This is something that should be commented: the setting of bits in 
system_vector is really misleading: those aren't "system vectors", they 
are the vectors reserved for hardware use. On IDT, this means vectors 
0-31 because they are used for exceptions, but on FRED interrupts and 
exceptions are separate; however vectors 0-15 still need to be reserved 
because the APIC doesn't support them.

We *could* change that, but that is completely independent of this.
