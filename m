This patch introduces a method to request a generic platform clocks
and resets by their names. As I already said these names are defined
by the DT-bindings, which are platform-specific. That's why the most
of the currently available drivers can't be converted to using it.
Instead the new drivers are supposed to be encouraged to use the
generic names (in accordance with the generic DW PCIe DT-schema) and
the resources request interface (based on the generic DT-bindings) if
it suits their design.

Anyway I honestly tried to come up with an even more generic
interface, which could be used by all the low-level drivers. But due
to too much variations of the resource names and their sometimes too
complex utilization in the drivers any solution looked too complex.
After all of thoughts I decided to keep things simpler.

>   PCI: dwc: Introduce generic resources getter

This patch defines a generic resource getter for the DW PCIe host and
end-point drivers. That's why it's called generic. 

>   PCI: dwc: Introduce generic controller capabilities interface

This patch introduces an interface to set the device-specific
capabilities. Since these capabilities can be marked as available by
both the core driver (at least two of them already defined within this
patchset) and low-level platform drivers the interface is called
as generic.

Removing some code is possible for instance from the pcie-visconti.c
driver by using the new generic clocks and resets request interface.
I've scheduled to create a small patchset which would do that after
the rest of my patches pass the review process.
