I can't quite parse this.  Are you saying that all PCI devices should
stay in D0 when the system is in S3?

The decision to keep a device in D0 is not up to qcom or any other PCI
controller driver.

I don't think we can assume that nothing will happen to cause exit
from L1.x.  For instance, PCIe Messages for INTx signaling, LTR, OBFF,
PTM, etc., may be sent even though we think the device is idle and
there should be no link activity.
