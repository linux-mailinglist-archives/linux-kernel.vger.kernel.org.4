Interesting point. I was digging the CPUID virtualization OF TDX/SNP.
It would be nice to have a conclusion of what is "sane" and what is the
proper role for KVM, as firmware/TDX module is going to validate the "sane"
CPUID.

TDX/SNP requires the CPUID to be pre-configured and validated before creating
a CC guest. (It is done via TDH.MNG.INIT in TDX and inserting a CPUID page in
SNP_LAUNCH_UPDATE in SNP).

IIUC according to what you mentioned, KVM should be treated like "CPUID box"
for QEMU and the checks in KVM is only to ensure the requirements of a chosen
one is literally possible and correct. KVM should not care if the combination, the usage of the chosen ones is insane or not, which gives QEMU flexibility.

As the valid CPUIDs have been decided when creating a CC guest, what should be
the proper behavior (basically any new checks?) of KVM for the later
SET_CPUID2? My gut feeling is KVM should know the "CPUID box" is reduced
at least, because some KVM code paths rely on guest CPUID configuration.
