No worries, the whole functionality is intrusive, so I prefer going
through some iterations until everyone is happy.  OTOH the
'supplicant' problem isn't going away soon.  We will try to move it to
the kernel but that has some difficulties as well and it's going to
take some time.  In any case, we've lived with the supplicant for
quite some time and the ftpm module has a similar set of problems.
IOW there are kernel modules that depend on it.
From a functionality point of view nothing will change if the
supplicant gets moved to kernel space.  It  will just make distros
life easier and remove the supplicant dependency.  I've attached a
patch that solves both the kernel panic and the fortunate side-effect
is that you don't have to remount the efivarfs.  If people like it, I
can send it as a fix
