Two more things to consider:
1. When wanting a 32kHz (well, 32768Hz) output with a 50% duty cycle,
   then we need hi=0 and lo=0 with a 64kHz input clock.
   See point 2 for an explanation of why 0 and not 1.
   Means we couldn't use the RTC input clock. Did you consider this?
   Or do I miss something?
2. Seems the PWM block internally increments hi and lo, except the
   constant_en bit is set on newer PWM block versions.
   For bigger cnt values the impact is negligible, but for very small
   values it's something we have to consider.
   This was one additional motivation for me to choose an input
   frequency that creates big cnt values.
