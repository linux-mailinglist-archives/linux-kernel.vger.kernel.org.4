FNAME(prefetch_invalid_gpte) has already verified the Accessed bit is set
in the GPTE and FNAME(protect_clean_gpte) has already verified the Dirty
bit is set in the GPTE.  These are only for guest AD bits.

And I don't think it is a good idea to pass @prefetch=false to make_spte(),
since the host might have cleared AD bit in the spte for aging or dirty-log,
The AD bits in the spte are better to be kept as before.

Though passing @prefetch=false would not cause any correctness problem
in the view of maintaining guest AD bits.

I might misunderstand what you meant or I failed to connect it with
the SDM properly.

I think there is no #PF here.

And even if the guest is requesting writable, the hypervisor is allowed to
set it non-writable and prepared to handle it in the ensuing write-fault.

Skipping to make it writable is a kind of lazy operation and considered
to be "the hypervisor doesn't grant the writable permission for a period
before next write-fault".

Thanks
Lai
