I do not have any ideas yet.

I suspect maybe we should plan to revert 5e85eba6f50d ("PCI/ASPM:
Refactor L1 PM Substates Control Register programming") and
4ff116d0d5fd ("PCI/ASPM: Save L1 PM Substates Capability for
suspend/resume") for now.

It's odd that they both appeared in v6.1, and we haven't seen a flood
of reports about this, so maybe there's something unusual about your
machine, Thomas.

I'll post a revert, and we can do that for v6.2 if we don't come up
with any other ideas.

Bjorn
