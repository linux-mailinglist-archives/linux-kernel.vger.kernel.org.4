Yes, I agree. TopdownL2 is not my intention here either. We can discuss
it later.

I don't think it's a pre-existing condition. KVM doesn't support the
perf metrics, so the feature will not be enumerated in a VM. The VM
kernel doesn't expose the related Topdown events.

Before the below patch, perf tool checks whether the topdown metrics
events are exposed by the kernel. If yes, it appends the topdown events
to perf stat default. If you run the previous perf tool in a ICX/SPR VM,
you should not see the topdown events.
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230219092848.639226-40-irogers@google.com/

However, the above patch delete the runtime check. It only relies on the
event list file, which doesn't have enough informatiom to tell whether
the feature/event is supported.

The kernel has been exposed the available events to
/sys/devices/cpu/events/. Why cannot we just check the availability
there, before invoking the perf_event_open?

To be honest, I don't think the current behavior is a new design.

I think I've mentioned the breakage when the change was introduced.
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/231233ec-a098-fab6-6444-3da46bdad039@linux.intel.com/

Before the above change, I think perf stat default works well, (no
multiplexing or <not counted>). I really wish we can be back to the
previous behavior.

I think the security/permission check is a different thing. We should
not return anything to a user but a warning when they don't have a
permission.

If they have the permission, I think the perf stat default should return
the available essential statistic information. No <not counted>, no
multiplexing, no warnings.

To summarize, I mainly have two comments.
- We need a clean perf stat default.
- We shouldn't only rely on the event list file. We need to do runtime
check on the availability of events. Either perf_event_open() or
/sys/devices/cpu/events/ is fine (althourh personally I prefer sys way,
since I think it's easier).

Thanks,
Kan
