So I guess acpi_pci_bridge_d3() looks for:

  - "wake signaling while in D3" (_S0W) and
  - "notification of hotplug while in D3" ("HotPlugSupportInD3")

For Root Ports with both those abilities (or bridges below such Root
Ports), we allow D3, and this patch doesn't change that.

What this patch *does* change is that all bridges with _PS0 or _PR0
previously could use D3, but now will only be able to use D3 if they
are also (or are below) a Root Port that can signal wakeup
(wakeup.flags.valid) and can wakeup from D3hot or D3cold (_S0W).

And this fixes the Pink Sardine because it has Root Ports that do
Thunderbolt tunneling, and they have _PS0 or _PR0 but their _S0W says
they cannot wake from D3.  Previously we put those in D3, but they
couldn't wake up.  Now we won't put them in D3.

I guess there's a possibility that this could break or cause higher
power consumption on systems that were fixed by c6e331312ebf
("PCI/ACPI: Whitelist hotplug ports for D3 if power managed by ACPI").
I don't know enough about that scenario.  Maybe Lukas will chime in.
