Latency is mostly related to propogation latency through SERDES PCS and
PMA layers.

On AM65x, all lanes go through SERDES of same design (but just different
instances) and thus latencies will remain same across lanes as the PCS
and PMA logics are same. So, the delays are not lane specific

I don't have a preference here...  Delays are dependent on PHYs being
used but something that host needs, will leave it to framework
maintainers.

PTM is definitely standard and vendor specific prefix don't make sense
to me.
