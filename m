Hi Song,

Ok, I mean the current patch was meant to be fairly conservative in that 
it attempts to only change codepaths where we are doing discards above 
the first zone. IE Changing only the codepaths that currently don't work.

But if we want to be more conservative (given this fixes corruption), I 
can post a patch to disable discard as you've suggested. I'm going to 
let the testing run for a while, so I'll post it in a bit.

Thanks,

-Jason
