Yes, although on-list discussion is still the primary channel, a call is
a nice supplement for all relevant people on a large, complex topic to
achieve quick alignment. For people not able to attend the call, the
meeting recordings/minutes can be posted for them.

This looks good, 9pm is not too late for PRC people.

Google Meet should work for me, but may not for every (PRC) people.
Besides no installation, if no registration would be even better ;)
Maybe we can run with Google Meet for the first session(s) if you
havn't get one in your mind, it's not too hard to switch to alternative
at a later time right?

Thanks for driving this, yes for UPM I would definitely join.
