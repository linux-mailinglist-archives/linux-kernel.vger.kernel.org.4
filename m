Yes, this solution seems a little cumbersome, but to solve the problem 
of error
information loss, I can only think of this solution.
I re-analyzed the issue scenario. Because the error information of the 
last journal
super block was not recorded. This will cause that the error flag will 
not be updated
when the super block is submitted subsequently. However, when processing 
orphan
list, the file system errors were recorded in the memory, and the orphan 
list were
cleared directly, resulting in file system inconsistencies. To solve 
above isuue, i sent
V3 patch.
