Recently eed807f62610 ("bpf: Tweak definition of KF_TRUSTED_ARGS")
relaxed things a bit, now that constraint is only for PTR_TO_BTF_ID
and it allows other types without ref_obj_id > 0.

But you're right, ctx loads should usually be trusted, this is the
current plan (also elaborated a bit in that link [0]), usually that is
true, an exception is free path as you noted in your reply for patch 1
(and especially fexit path where object may not even be alive
anymore). There are some details to work out, but eventually I'd want
to force KF_TRUSTED_ARGS by default for all kfuncs, and we only make
exceptions in some special cases by having some KF_UNSAFE flag or
__unsafe tag for arguments. It's becoming harder to think about all
permutations if we're too permissive by default in terms of acceptable
arguments.
