Ah, yes. I forgot to mention it in the cover letter but I noticed that 
some of those seem to be workarounds for the cases where core refuses to 
disable ASPM. Some sites even explicit have a comment about that after 
the call to pci_disable_link_state():

static void bcm4377_disable_aspm(struct bcm4377_data *bcm4377)
{
        pci_disable_link_state(bcm4377->pdev,
                               PCIE_LINK_STATE_L0S | PCIE_LINK_STATE_L1);

        /*
         * pci_disable_link_state can fail if either CONFIG_PCIEASPM is disabled
         * or if the BIOS hasn't handed over control to us. We must *always*
         * disable ASPM for this device due to hardware errata though.
         */
        pcie_capability_clear_word(bcm4377->pdev, PCI_EXP_LNKCTL,
                                   PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_ASPMC);
}

That kinda feels something that would want a force disable quirk that is 
reliable. There are quirks for some devices which try to disable it but 
could fail for reasons mentioned in that comment. (But I'd prefer to make 
another series out of it rather than putting it into this one.)

It might even be that some drivers don't even bother to make the 
pci_disable_link_state() call because it isn't reliable enough.
