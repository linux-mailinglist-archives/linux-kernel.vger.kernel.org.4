IIRC there were reasons for wanting as much ZONE_NORMAL memory as 
possible; for the embedded folks who are already typically running with 
"swiotlb=noforce" to save memory because they know their hardware, we 
may as well let them have the footgun. Distros and other general-purpose 
configs should rightly not be going anywhere near this.
