It should, see REFCOUNT_ADD_UAF in include/linux/refcount.h.

This should work, but you would have to go through a lot of tests,
sadly I assumed it is global in a lot of places to make testing easier
(e.g. observing count after releasing by doing p->next, which gave me
a PTR_TO_BTF_ID that is preserved after release).
Some other way would have to be found to do the same thing.

In the case of RCU I don't plan on passing the rcu pointer to acquire
functions, but rather kptr_get stops taking pointer to pointer. I.e.
in your point 3, kptr_get does what you want _acquire to do. It takes
an rcu protected pointer to an object and safely increments its count.

I think it's unlikely kptr_get can work without it, spinlocks may be
required internally (e.g. to inspect the object key/generation in
SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU case without races) but that goes on top of RCU
protection. But yes, it depends, maybe it will work for some special
cases. Though I don't think it's worth adding an example for the
uncommon case.

So you will still need kptr_get helpers, some of them simply do
refcount_inc_not_zero, others may do a little more.
Anyway, let's discuss more when the set is posted.

Yes.
