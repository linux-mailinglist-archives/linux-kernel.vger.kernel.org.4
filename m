I am afraid that you mixed things up:

You mistake is that x2avic is just a minor addition to AVIC. It is still for
all practical purposes the same feature.

 
1. The AVIC is indeed kind of broken on Zen2 (but AFAIK for all practical purposes,
   including nested it works fine, the errata only shows up in a unit test and/or
   under very specific workloads (most of the time a delayed wakeup doesn't cause a hang).
   Yet, I agree that for production Zen2 should not have AVIC enabled.
 

2. Zen3 does indeed have AVIC soft disabled in CPUID. AFAIK it works just fine,
   but I understand that customers won't use it against AMD's guidance.
 
 
3. On Zen4, AVIC is fully enabled and also extended to support x2apic mode.
   The fact that AVIC was extended to support X2apic mode also shows that AMD
   is committed to supporting it.
 
 
My nested AVIC code technically doesn't expose x2avic to the guest, but it
is pretty much trivial to add (I am only waiting to get my hands on Zen4 machine
to do it), and also even in its current form it would work just fine if the host
uses normal AVIC .
 
(or even doesn't use AVIC at all - the nested AVIC code works just fine
even if the host has its AVIC inhibited for some reason).
 
Adding nested x2avic support is literally about not passing through that MMIO address,
Enabling the x2avic bit in int_ctl, and opening up the access to x2apic msrs.
Plus I need to do some minor changes in unaccelerated IPI handler, dealing
With read-only logical ID and such.
 
Physid tables, apic backing pages, doorbell emulation, 
everything is pretty much unchanged.
 
So AVIC is nothing but a legacy feature, and my nested AVIC code will support
both nested AVIC and nested X2AVIC.
 
Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
