Indeed -- my point was that I don't think e.g. clearing PTR_TRUSTED when
we set PTR_UNTRUSTED will work, at least not yet. It's still too tricky
to find all the places where we'd have to &= ~PTR_TRUSTED or |=
PTR_TRUSTED when setting specific type modifiers. As described below, we
first have to clarify the general workflow to enable the presence of
PTR_TRUSTED to be the single source of truth for trust.

I think I agree. MEM_ALLOC should always imply PTR_TRUSTED. Ideally we
shouldn't have to check MEM_ALLOC for KF_TRUSTED_ARGS at all, and
PTR_TRUSTED should be the only modifier representing if something is
safe. For now I'd prefer to keep them separate until we have a clear
plan, especially with respect to clearing PTR_TRUSTED for when something
unsafe happens like PTR_UNTRUSTED or PTR_MAYBE_NULL. It's all too
muddied still.

I think it's probably too cumbersome now, but yeah, as mentioned above,
I think it's the right direction. I think it will require a lot of
thought to do it right, though. With the code the way that it is now, I
can't convince myself that we wouldn't do something like |= PTR_TRUSTED
when we observe ref_obj_id > 0, and then later &= ~PTR_TRUSTED when
setting PTR_MAYBE_NULL. I think Kumar's latest patch set is a nice step
towards achieving this clearer state. Hopefully we can continue to
improve.

Further agreed, this is the correct longer-term direction.

Yeah, I think this is the correct way to model this for now. Later on
once we refactor things, the presence of PTR_TRUSTED on its own should
be sufficient. A good north star to aim towards.

I'll send this out as v8 tomorrow.
