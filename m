Here's the link to the Code of Conduct:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html

Which states:

  Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

    - Using welcoming and inclusive language
    - Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
    - Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
    - Focusing on what is best for the community
    - Showing empathy towards other community members

  Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    - The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
    - Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
    - Public or private harassment
    - Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
    - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

I do not see how Dave's response is a violation of any of the above.

Asking someone to resign is a personal attack, and that can be construed as
a violation of the Code of Conduct.

Let's please keep this on a technical level, as there appears to be a fix
we all can agree on, and let's move forward on that.

Thanks,
