I've read this code before, but it doesn't run and since you haven't updated
it, I assumed you dropped it :(

This approach seems appropriate for dynamic ftrace trampolines, but I think
there are two more issues for bpf.

1. bpf trampoline was designed to be called directly from fentry (located in
    kernel function or bpf prog). So to make it work as ftrace_op, we may end
    up with two different bpf trampoline types on arm64, one for bpf prog and
    the other for ftrace.

2. Performance overhead, as we always jump to a static ftrace trampoline to
    construct execution environment for bpf trampoline, then jump to the bpf
    trampoline to construct execution environment for bpf prog, then jump to
    the bpf prog, so for some small bpf progs or hot functions, the calling
    overhead may be unacceptable.

Sorry for that, hope you getting better soon.
