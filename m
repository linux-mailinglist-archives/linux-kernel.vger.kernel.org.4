Persistent data is stored encypted with e.g. the master key in hex-ascii 
already and should not be affected. Only persistent data stored 
unencrypted is affected, but the encrypted-keys stuff is just about 
avoiding that. Or do I still misunderstand something?

The unencrypted data from testcases/kernel/syscalls/keyctl/keyctl09.c 
looks like hex-ascii to me:
#define ENCRYPTED_KEY_VALID_PAYLOAD    "new enc32 user:masterkey 32 abcdefABCDEF1234567890aaaaaaaaaa"

And beeing it hex-ascii is checked in encrypted.c driver:
 		for (i = 0; i < strlen(decrypted_data); i++) {
 			if (!isxdigit(decrypted_data[i])) {
 				pr_err("encrypted key: decrypted data provided must contain only hexadecimal characters\n");
 				return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
 			}
 		}

It was never possible to provide unencrypted data other than hex-ascii, it 
just wasn't decoded to binary, so the resulting key was simply wrong and 
rendered CONFIG_USER_DECRYPTED_DATA useless. Because the resulting binary 
key was limited to the hex-ascii range of values.

With that being said, I would expect the existing test fail and the 
corrected test to pass.
