I was thinking this today. SNP uses this trick to cope with the existing
HW design. It is mandatory for SNP. What was the benefit of
removing/restoring the directmap for the purpose of restricting the access
from the kernel for TDX? Probably catching a wrong touch to a private
kernel page from the kernel space instead of triggering MCE.

My point goes to let them stay in SNP for now as they seems closely coupled
with RMUPDATE so far and the timing of doing RMUPDATE is still under
discussion. Maybe we invent some new pre/post, but they turn not necessary
later if the timing of RMUPDATE is changed.

Yes. I was thinking so. When I was reading the APM, I thought one of the
advantages of SNP architecture was splitting the HW-enforced check from NPT
mapping management. Thus when updating the RMP, the NPT can stay as it is. I
guess that's why I was so fancying of eliminating the extra zapping.

After reading the code of the UPM, I think we did need the zapping here for
SNP as pages for private memory and shared memory seem from different
sources. shared <->private memory conversion needs to wipe the mapping of
pages from one source and go through a fault-mapping flow on the pages
from the other source. Still wondering if there is any good idea to improve
it based on the current approaches.

Do you mean pre-accepting the whole system memory? or only the initial
allocated memory for OVMF?

TDX has already been working in a lazy-acceptance style. I believe the
lazy-acceptance will be the furture direction. But I understand that part
can be in stage 2 with the lazy-acceptance for SNP.

They are mainly for the TDP MMU to manipulate the TDX secure EPT through
firmware call. Due to the TDX architecture (1 shared + 1 secure EPT) and
mirror secure EPT design, TDP MMU is aware there is a "secure EPT but with
reduced-features", when  a #PF happens which EPT should be operated, and
when memory attr is changed which EPT should be zapped. Those callbacks
in TDP MMU are used for maintaining the mirror secure EPT.

SNP designs in a different way. It doesn't need the TDP MMU to be aware of
"there is another kind of NPT" as the enforced check is done in RMP, SNP can
easily, keep all the RMP routines out of the TDP MMU. Also, SNP doesn't need
 a mirror NPT. Thus, SNP doesn't need those callbacks.

In *theory*, it is possible to re-purpose some of the callbacks and merge
RMP update into TDP MMU, like omitting the manipulating mirror secure EPT part
for SNP, but updating the RMP in the callback of setting SPTE. But I have to
think about what would be the benefit as it doesn't fit the SNP HW nature.
