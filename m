I meant that the entry was incorrect, not that Linux behaviour was incorrect.

I have also searched and browsed the ACPI spec, but have found no general rule
that the OS should use the first or the last matching element from a list (in a general case,
not just _PRT).

I don't know whether this works on Windows, or just the laptop OEM did not care
about the i2c bus on this model.

As a start, we may just print a warning when the _PRT table contains multiple matching
entries for a given device - to see if there are any other devices that are affected
(and which of the interrupt vectors for them is the correct one). This would be simpler
then my proposed patch.

Greetings,

Mateusz
