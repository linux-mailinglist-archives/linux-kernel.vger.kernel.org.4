Wouldn't a compiler be within its rights to implement a one byte store as:

	load-word
	modify-byte-in-word
	store-word

and if this is a lockless store to a word which has an adjacent byte also
being modified by another CPU, one of those CPUs can lose its store?
And WRITE_ONCE would prevent the compiler from implementing the store
in that way.
