Firmware do you mean the firmware on I219 device, or BIOS?

There's nothing gets logged. When this happens the ACPI GPE is dead silent.

Device Manager shows the current PCI state.

Sure, will change it.

The restriction for CNP+ was introduced by commit 459d69c407f9
("e1000e: Disable runtime PM on CNP+") and modified by 3335369bad99
("e1000e: Remove the runtime suspend restriction on CNP+").
