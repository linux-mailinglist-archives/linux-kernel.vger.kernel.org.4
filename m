Some metric groups have metrics that don't have fully overlapping
events, meaning that the group's events become unique event groups
that may need to multiplex with each other. This can be particularly
unfortunate when the groups wouldn't need to multiplex because there
are sufficient hardware counters.

Add a flag so that if recording a metric group then the metrics within
the group needn't use groups for their events. The flag is added to
Intel TopdownL1 and TopdownL2 metrics.
