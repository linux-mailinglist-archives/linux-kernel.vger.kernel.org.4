Yes, devm_regmap_del_irq_chip() also led to a call trace. I thought it
might be the order of release, so I called it myself without devm_.

I used to be rough at fixing in my test, I tried to set gc->irq.domain = NULL
after calling irq_domain_remove() in gpiochip_irqchip_remove(). But
there seemed to be some other issue that was causing my device to not
work, so I didn't go further. I wonder what risks such fix introduces.

Sorry I may not be able to do the fix patch for a while. I'm working on
other patches, this test will disrupt my work.
