IIUC, the problem is observed on the link between the ASM2824
downstream port and the PI7C9X2G304 upstream port, so my question is
about asserting SBR on the ASM2824 downstream port.  I think that
should cause the link between ASM2824 and PI7C9X2G304 to go down and
back up.

Thanks for the question; I didn't notice before that this quirk
applies to *all* devices.  I'm a little queasy about trying to fix
problems we have not observed.  In this case, I think the hardware is
*supposed* to establish a link at the highest supported speed
automatically.

If we need to work around a hardware bug, that's fine, but I'm not
sure I want to blindly try to help things along.
