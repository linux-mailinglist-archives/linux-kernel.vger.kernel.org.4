I recommend doing it as a separate patch, hardening cpu_feature_enabled() s=
houldn't
have a dependency on tweaking the xfeatures mask.  I tested this with an al=
lyesconfig
if you want to throw it in as a prep patch.

Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpufeature: Require compile-time constant in
 cpu_feature_enabled()

Assert that the to-be-checked bit passed to cpu_feature_enabled() is a
compile-time constant instead of applying the DISABLED_MASK_BIT_SET()
logic if and only if the bit is a constant.  Conditioning the check on
the bit being constant instead of requiring the bit to be constant could
result in compiler specific kernel behavior, e.g. running on hardware that
supports a disabled feature would return %false if the compiler resolved
the bit to a constant, but %true if not.

All current usage of cpu_feature_enabled() specifies a hardcoded
X86_FEATURE_* flag, so this *should* be a glorified nop.

The CPUID bits that enumerate support for a feature are independent from th=
e CPUID
bits that enumerate what XCR0 bits are supported, i.e. what features can be=
 saved
and restored via XSAVE/XRSTOR.

KVM does mostly account for host XCR0, but in a very ad hoc way.  E.g. MPX =
is
handled by manually checking host XCR0.

	if (kvm_mpx_supported())
		kvm_cpu_cap_check_and_set(X86_FEATURE_MPX);

PKU manually checks too, but indirectly by looking at whether or not the ke=
rnel
has enabled CR4.OSPKE.

	if (!tdp_enabled || !boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_OSPKE))
		kvm_cpu_cap_clear(X86_FEATURE_PKU);

But unless I'm missing something, the various AVX and AMX bits rely solely =
on
boot_cpu_data, i.e. would break if someone added CONFIG_X86_AVX or CONFIG_X=
86_AMX.
