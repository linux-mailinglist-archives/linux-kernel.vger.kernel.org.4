We receive a lot of bindings to review. If I glimpse through every
datasheet, when would I work?

Instead of expecting reviewer to dive into datasheets for this one
particular sensor, make it explicit in commit msg.

Not really an argument... You can correct the other pieces in separate
patch.

The same.

It does not matter here, what the driver is doing. Use only one unit
here, matching the DTS.

There are multiple datasheets and how would I know to which one this refers?

Not really an argument... Poor examples like to spread, it's an effort
to drop them.

Yes, I am clueless and that's not the way how the review conversation
should look like.

NAK.

Nope. I expect the new pieces to be correct, not incorrect because
"there is already poor pattern, so I will do the same".

If inconsistency bothers you, anyone can fix it in following up patch.
Also you.
