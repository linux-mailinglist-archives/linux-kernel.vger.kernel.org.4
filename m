I think we probably *should* be evaluating _REG for bridges and
endpoints during enumeration, but I don't think we should depend on
pci_enable_device() to do it.

If a method uses the PCI config OpRegion, I think it should work at
any time, but with this patch it looks like it will only work after a
transition to D0.
