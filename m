I read this as "trying to bring the link up is mandatory because
we can't detect an empty slot, therefore ~1ms delay during boot
is unavoidable" and on that Rob's suggestion applies.

Just to understand where this thread is going. The suggestion
above does not change the aim of this patch, that seems reasonable
to me and it makes sense even if/when what Rob is suggesting is
implemented.

Is that correct ?
