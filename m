What you want is against the architecture. To fix this, you might change
the architecture of the driver to have one chip for the controller, but
it's quite questionable change. Also how can you guarantee ordering of
the enumeration? You probably need to *disable* SMP on the boot time.
This will still be fragile as long as GPIO chip can be unbound at run
time. Order can be changed.

So, the patch is good and the correct way to go.

P.S. The root cause is that hardware engineers and documentation writers
do not consider their hardware in the multi-tasking, multi-user general
purpose operating system, such as Linux. I believe the ideal fix is to fix the
documentation (datasheet).
