By RT Linux, I am referring to Linux with Real Time configs enabled such as
PREEMPT_RT, which results in faster code execution and lower latency.
All along, it appears to be the case that with the Link Training initiated in
PCIe controller hardware, the driver proceeds to finish the probe and therefore
allow the PCI core subsystem to perform enumeration. However, as it turns out,
the driver appears to have been depending on the latency of other processes
running in the background, due to which the device enumeration process by the
PCI core subsystem got delayed, thereby ensuring that the Link Training process
in the PCIe controller hardware had successfully finished by that point in time.
With RT configs, that latency has been reduced, resulting in the bus enumeration
process starting off much earlier, and occurring while the PCIe controller is
still performing Link Training.

Please let me know if further clarification is required in addition to my
comment above.
