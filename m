No, I think it would be good enough: locality 0 means anyone (including
the kernel on a machine which doesn't function correctly) could have
created this key.  Locality 2 would mean only the kernel could have
created this key.

By the time the kernel boots and before it loads the hibernation image
it will know the answer to the question "does my TPM support locality
2", so it can use that in its security assessment: if the kernel
supports locality 2 and the key wasn't created in locality 2 then
assume an attack.  Obviously, if the kernel doesn't support locality 2
then the hibernation resume has to accept any old key, but that's the
same as the situation today.

It's probably good enough.  Current laptops which can't use locality 2
are in the same position as now, but newer ones can provide more
security guarantees.

There is, however, another wrinkle: can Kaby Lake be persuaded, though
bios settings perhaps, to shut off the non zero localities?  This would
allow for a downgrade attack where you shut off locality 2 then present
a forged locality 0 key and hibernation image; the kernel will think,
because it can't access locality 2, that it's in a reduced security
environment so the key might be OK.  We could fix this by requiring
Kaby Lake and beyond to have locality 2 and refusing to hibernate if it
can't be accessed and building "is this Kaby lake or beyond" into the
check for should I have locality 2, but this is getting complex and
error prone.
