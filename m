So, not having actually been send many of the patches I've no idea what
you've done... Please, eradicate this ridiculous idea of sending random
people a random subset of a patch series. Either send all of it or none,
this is a bloody nuisance.

Having said that; my biggest worry is that you're making scheduler
internals into an ABI. I would hate for this paravirt interface to tie
us down.
