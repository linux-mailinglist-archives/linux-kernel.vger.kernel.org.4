Right. :)

It's doable but I was a bit afraid of the complexity or confusion
it might bring up.  It should handle expressions like 'A && B || C'
then we need to be clear on the precedence of them.  Currently
it would behave like 'A && (B || C)' but users might expect
'(A && B) || C'.

Then we might want to add the parentheses explicitly to adjust
the operator priority.  That could result in complex expressions
possibly with nested parentheses.  I'm not sure if we really want
this.  Considering the restrictions in BPF, I think we should keep
the expressions as simple as possible.

Thanks,
Namhyung
