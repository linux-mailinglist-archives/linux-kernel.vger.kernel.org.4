I'm not sure about replacing tracepoint filters.  IIRC BPF is optional,
then tracepoints should work without it.  From the BPF's perspective,
it has its own way of handling tracepoints so no need to deal with
perf or event tracing (ftrace) for that.

From the perf's perspective, I think it can use either the existing ftrace
filters or build a new BPF filter for each event.  But it cannot use BTF
for perf tracepoint events at least for now.  Certainly it can use RAW
sample data and parse the event format to access the fields but I'm
not sure it's worth doing that. :)

Thanks,
Namhyung
