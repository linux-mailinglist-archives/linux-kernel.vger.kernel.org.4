Remote draining reduces interruptions whether CPU 
is marked as isolated or not:

- Allows isolated CPUs from benefiting of pcp caching.
- Removes the interruption to non isolated CPUs. See for example 

https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/6/13/2769

"Minchan Kim tested this independently and reported;

       My workload is not NOHZ CPUs but run apps under heavy memory
       pressure so they goes to direct reclaim and be stuck on
       drain_all_pages until work on workqueue run.

       unit: nanosecond
       max(dur)        avg(dur)                count(dur)
       166713013       487511.77786438033      1283

       From traces, system encountered the drain_all_pages 1283 times and
       worst case was 166ms and avg was 487us.

       The other problem was alloc_contig_range in CMA. The PCP draining
       takes several hundred millisecond sometimes though there is no
       memory pressure or a few of pages to be migrated out but CPU were
       fully booked.

       Your patch perfectly removed those wasted time."
