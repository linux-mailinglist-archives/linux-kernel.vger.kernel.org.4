That's also a hell much more snazzier MODULE_DEBUG_AUTOLOAD_DUPS if we
ever wanted to do something similar there if we wanted to also
join request_module() calls, instead of it hiding under debug.

For boot it's fine, as I can't think of boot wanting to support trying
to load a module with different arguments but who knows. But I can't
see it sensible to issue concurrent multiple requests for modules
with different arguments without waiting in userspace for the first
to fail.

Even post-boot, doing that sounds rather insane, but it would certainly
be a compromise and should probably be clearly documented. I think just
a comment acknolwedging that corner case seems sensible.

Because we won't be able to get the arguments until we process the
module, so it would be too late for this optimization on kread. So it is
why I had also stuck to the original feature being in kread, as then it
provides a uniq kread call and the caller is aware of it. But indeed I
had not considered the effects of arguments.

Lucas, any thoughts from modules kmod userspace perspective into
supporting anyone likely issuing concurrent modules requests with
differing arguments?

Personally I think it's a fine optimization without the arguments.

The only thing I can think of is allowing threads other than the
first one to complete before the one that actually loaded the
module. I thought about this race for module auto-loading, see
the comment in kmod_dup_request_announce(), so that just
further delays the completion to other thread with a stupid
queue_work(). That seems more important for module auto-loading
duplicates than for boot finit_module() duplicates. But not sure
if odering matters in the end due to a preemtible kernel and maybe
that concern is hysteria.

Sold:

on 255 vcpus 0 duplicates found with this setup:

In terms of bootup timing:

Before:
Startup finished in 41.653s (kernel) + 44.305s (userspace) = 1min 25.958s        
graphical.target reached after 44.178s in userspace.                             
                                                                                 
After:                                                                           
Startup finished in 23.995s (kernel) + 40.350s (userspace) = 1min 4.345s         
graphical.target reached after 40.226s in userspace. 

So other than the brain farts above, I think this is pretty sexy.
