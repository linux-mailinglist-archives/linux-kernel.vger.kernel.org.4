Hi Raghavendra,

Right off the bat, I'd much prefer it if the patches weren't posted this
way. Building on top of an in flight series requires that reviewers page
in the context from Reiji's selftest patch in another thread then read
what you have.

I imagine this happened organically because you two are developing in
parallel (which is great!), but at this point Reiji's kernel changes are
only tangientally related to the selftest. Given that, is it possible to
split the test + KVM changes into two distinct series that each of you
will own? That way it is possible to get the full picture from one email
thread alone.

sidenote: if you wind up reposting the complete series these can just be
squashed into the original patch.
