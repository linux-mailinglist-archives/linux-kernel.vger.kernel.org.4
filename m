If that sounds OK I'd prefer that. This keeps the drivers current limit:

static int get_ext_report(struct snp_guest_dev *snp_dev, struct
snp_guest_request_ioctl *arg)
...
if (req.certs_len > SEV_FW_BLOB_MAX_SIZE ||
    !IS_ALIGNED(req.certs_len, PAGE_SIZE))
return -EINVAL;

I'd prefer not to add extra features during the bug fix. But happy to
make this work with buffers greater than SEV_FW_BLOB_MAX_SIZE as
follow up if you want.
