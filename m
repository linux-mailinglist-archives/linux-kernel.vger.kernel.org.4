Not necessarily, but to play safe I would go case-by-case and make
sure other governors are aligned to this new feature.

E.g. the bang-bang governor operates only on current temperature and
current trip value + trip hysteresis. The flow graph describes it [1].
The control (state of the fan: ON or OFF) of that governor could be
simply adjusted to the new reality -> new trip point temp. That would
just mean 'toggling' the fan if needed. There are only 2 'target'
states: 0 or 1 for the fan. You can images a situation when the
temperature doesn't change, but we manipulate the trip value for that
governor. The governor would react correctly always in such situation
w/o a need of a reset IMO.

OK, thanks.

Di could you implement that 'reset()' API according to this description,
please?

Thanks Rafael for the comments and the progress that we made :)
