Any specific reason you didn't cc: the linux-hardening mailing list?
This seems to be in their area as well, right?

That is, frankly, a very funny threat model.  How realistic is it really
given all of the other ways that a hypervisor can mess with a guest?

So what do you actually trust here?  The CPU?  A device?  Nothing?

So you trust all of qemu but not Linux?  Or am I misreading that
diagram?

I hate the term "hardening".  Please just say it for what it really is,
"fixing bugs to handle broken hardware".  We've done that for years when
dealing with PCI and USB and even CPUs doing things that they shouldn't
be doing.  How is this any different in the end?

So what you also are saying here now is "we do not trust any PCI
devices", so please just say that (why do you trust USB devices?)  If
that is something that you all think that Linux should support, then
let's go from there.

Again, as our documentation states, when you submit patches based on
these tools, you HAVE TO document that.  Otherwise we think you all are
crazy and will get your patches rejected.  You all know this, why ignore
it?

Random github trees of kernel patches are just that, sorry.

Yes, start out by laying out what you feel the actual problem is, what
you feel should be done for it, and the patches you have proposed to
implement this, for each and every logical piece.

Again, nothing new here, that's how Linux is developed, again, you all
know this, it's not anything I should have to say.

As always, we can't do anything without actual working changes to the
code, otherwise it's just a pipe dream and we can't waste our time on it
(neither would you want us to).

thanks, and good luck!
