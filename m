And those changes have already been implemented and pushed out

When moving out of the kernel to userspace, you loose the common and
neutral user/kernel api and are now forced to rely on a userspace
program for access to that device.  no longer can you do something like
normal socket calls, but instead, you have to rely on a library for the
same functionality.

Same for block devices.  Do you really want to give up that common
interface to your block device and rely on a library instead of the
kernel?

If so, great, but don't take away the functionality from all users, as
you will break their systems.
