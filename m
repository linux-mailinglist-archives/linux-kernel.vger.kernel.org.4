TDX provides increased levels of memory confidentiality and integrity.
This requires special hardware support for features like memory
encryption and storage of memory integrity checksums.  Not all memory
satisfies these requirements.

As a result, the TDX introduced the concept of a "Convertible Memory
Region" (CMR).  During boot, the BIOS builds a list of all of the memory
regions which can provide the TDX security guarantees.  The list of CMRs
is available to the kernel by querying the TDX module or its loader.

However those TDX-capable memory regions are not automatically usable to
the TDX module.  The kernel needs to choose the memory regions that will
be used as TDX memory and pass those memory regions to the TDX module
when initializing it.  Once passed to the TDX module, those TDX-usable
memory regions are fixed during the module's lifetime.  The TDX module
doesn't support adding new TDX-usable memory after it gets initialized.

To keep things simple, this initial implementation chooses to use all
boot-time present memory managed by the page allocator as TDX memory.
This requires all boot-time present memory to be TDX convertible memory,
which is true in practice.  If there's any boot-time memory which isn't
TDX convertible memory (which is allowed from TDX architecture's point
of view), it will be caught later during TDX module initialization and
the initialization will fail.

However one machine may support both TDX and non-TDX memory both at
machine boot time and runtime.  For example, any memory hot-added at
runtime cannot be TDX memory.  Also, for now NVDIMM and CXL memory are
not TDX memory, no matter whether they are present at machine boot time
or not.

This raises a problem that, if any non-TDX memory is hot-added to the
system-wide memory allocation pool, a non-TDX page may be allocated to a
TDX guest, which will result in failing to create the TDX guest, or
killing it at runtime.

The current implementation doesn't explicitly prevent adding any non-TDX
memory to system-wide memory pool, but depends on the machine owner to
make sure such operation won't happen.  For example, the machine owner
should never plug any NVDIMM or CXL memory into the machine, or use kmem
driver to hot-add any to the core-mm.

This will be enhanced in the future.  One solution is the kernel can be
enforced to always guarantee all pages in the page allocator are TDX
memory (i.e. by rejecting non-TDX memory in memory hotplug).  Another
option is the kernel may support different memory capabilities on basis
of NUMA node.  For example, the kernel can have both TDX-compatible NUMA
node and non-TDX-compatible memory NUMA node, and the userspace needs to
explicitly bind TDX guests to those TDX-compatible memory NUMA nodes.

Use memblock to get all memory regions as it is the source from where
the memory pages are freed to the page allocator.  This saves the
metadata that is needed to be allocated and given to the TDX module when
initializing it in case like 'memmap' kernel command is used.

Also, don't use memblock directly when initializing the TDX module, but
make a snapshot of all memory regions in the memblock during kernel
boot.  This is because:

1) Memblock is discarded after kernel boots if CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK
   is not enabled.
2) Memblock can be changed by memory hotplug (i.e. memory removal of
   boot-time present memory) at runtime if it is kept.
3) The first 1MB may not be enumerated as CMR on some platforms, so the
   first 1MB cannot be included as TDX memory.  Looping over all TDX
   memory blocks will be done couple of times when initializing the TDX
   module.  Instead of using memblock directly and manually excluding
   the first 1MB for each loop, just do a snapshot to exclude the first
   1MB once.
