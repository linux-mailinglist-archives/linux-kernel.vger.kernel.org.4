Not only that NVMe is expecting the device state to be always in D0. So 
any PCIe
drivers should not turn off the link in suspend and do link retraining 
in the resume.
As this is considered a power cycle by the NVMe device and eventually 
increases the
wear of the NVMe flash.

We are trying to keep the device in D0 and also reduce the power 
consumption when the system
is in S3 by turning off clocks and phy with this patch series.

After the link enters the L1.x it will come out only if there is some 
activity on the link.
AS system is suspended and NVMe driver is also suspended( queues will  
freeze in suspend)
who else can initiate any data. As long the link stays in L1ss we can 
turn off clocks and phy.
When the system resumes we turn off clocks and phy before resuming the 
NVMe, this makes sure
the clocks and phy are up before there is any activity to bring up the 
link back to L0 state from L1.x.
