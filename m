Ah, I see. Hmm, I guess this is better than what we have now, but is
still a lot of macros and boilerplate which IMO is a sign we're not
going in quite the right direction. I don't really have a better
suggestion at this point, though I do like Kumar's suggestion below.

If nobody would come after us with pitchforks for this, IMO this is the
most user-friendly option and what I would vote for. It doesn't seem
like this is violating anything in [0]?
