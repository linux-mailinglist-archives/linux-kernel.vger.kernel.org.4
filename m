And I concur with all the above as well. Putting this in the kernel is
not an obvious fit at all as that requires a number of assumptions about
the VMM.

As Oliver pointed out, the guest topology, and how it maps to the host
topology (vcpu pinning etc) is very much a VMM policy decision and will
be particularly important to handle guest frequency requests correctly.

In addition to that, the VMM's software architecture may have an impact.
Crosvm for example does device emulation in separate processes for
security reasons, so it is likely that adjusting the scheduling
parameters ('util_guest', uclamp, or else) only for the vCPU thread that
issues frequency requests will be sub-optimal for performance, we may
want to adjust those parameters for all the tasks that are on the
critical path.

And at an even higher level, assuming in the kernel a certain mapping of
vCPU threads to host threads feels kinda wrong, this too is a host
userspace policy decision I believe. Not that anybody in their right
mind would want to do this, but I _think_ it would technically be
feasible to serialize the execution of multiple vCPUs on the same host
thread, at which point the util_guest thingy becomes entirely bogus. (I
obviously don't want to conflate this use-case, it's just an example
that shows the proposed abstraction in the series is not a perfect fit
for the KVM userspace delegation model.)

So +1 from me to move this as a virtual device of some kind. And if the
extra cost of exiting all the way back to userspace is prohibitive (is
it btw?), then we can try to work on that. Maybe something a la vhost
can be done to optimize, I'll have a think.

I presume some kind of signalling mechanism will be necessary to
synchronously update host scheduling parameters in response to guest
frequency requests, but if the volume of data requires it then a shared
buffer + doorbell type of approach should do.

Thinking about it, using SCMI over virtio would implement exactly that.
Linux-as-a-guest already supports it IIRC, so possibly the problem
being addressed in this series could be 'simply' solved using an SCMI
backend in the VMM...
