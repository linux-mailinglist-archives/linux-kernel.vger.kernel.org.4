If option 3 is the best one, should I post another patch implementing your
suggestion of using the boolean variable (link_trained) for storing the link
training status as suggested by you at:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/ZIBanRGGPeFw90NZ@lpieralisi/

Also, I can drop the:
dev_info(dev, "Link training complete\n");
message as suggested by Mani at:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230608154206.GI5672@thinkpad/

Please let me know.
