I am not talking about an implicit behavior that we do not want to cast
into interface. If we want to allow a fine grained control over demotion
then the implementation shouldn't rely on the current behavior.

Demotion is just a fancy name of a directed migration. There is no realy
dependency on the HW nor the technology.
