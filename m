Both QC and Google know there were other factors which delayed this last 
3-4 months.

But, I do not have any concrete justification to give you for the delays 
before that apart from perhaps other higher priority chrome and upstream 
bugs which kept cropping up.

Hence, all I can offer is my apologies for the delay.

After seeing this patch on the list, we have revived this effort now and 
re-assigned this within our team to take over from where that was left 
off. It will need some time to transition but this will see the end of 
the tunnel soon.

Thanks

Abhinav
