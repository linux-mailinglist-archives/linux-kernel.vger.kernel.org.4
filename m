Hi Mario,

The patch itself looks fine, but since I don't have all the power
management details in my head, it would help me a lot to make the
description more concrete.

It sounds like the real issue is that "Root Ports in D3hot/D3cold may
not support wakeup", and the USB, xHCI, USB-C, AMD USB4 router bits
are probably not really relevant.  And hopefully even the "AMD
platforms" mentioned below is not relevant.

Can we connect this to a spec so it's not just the empirical "some AMD
platforms work like X" observation?

"s2idle" is meaningful on the power management side of the house, but
it doesn't appear in PCI or ACPI specs, so I don't know what it means
here.  I assume the D3hot/D3cold state of the Root Port is the
critical factor, regardless of how it got there.

The Windows behavior was probably useful to you in debugging, but I
don't really care about these Windows details because I don't think
they help us maintain this in the future.

But I *would* like to know specifically what "power manageable" means
here.  I might naively assume that a device with the PCI Power
Management Capability is "power manageable", and that if PME_Support
includes D3hot and D3cold, we're good to go.  But obviously it's more
complicated than that, and I'd like to cite the spec that mentions the
actual things we need here.

I assume "it's not safe" really means "Root Ports in D3hot/D3cold may
not be able to signal PME interrupts unless ... <mumble> platform
firmware <mumble> e.g., ACPI method <mumble> ..."

Can we include some of those hints here?
