Never mapping anything into the userspace page table is infeasible.  Techni=
cally
it's doable, but it'd effectively require all of the work of an fd-based ap=
proach
(and probably significantly more), _and_ it'd require touching core mm code=
.

VMAs don't provide hva=3D>pfn information, they're the kernel's way of impl=
ementing
the abstraction provided to userspace by mmap(), mprotect() etc.  Among man=
y other
things, a VMA describes properties of what is mapped, e.g. hugetblfs versus
anonymous, where memory is mapped (virtual address), how memory is mapped, =
e.g.
RWX protections, etc.  But a VMA doesn't track the physical address, that i=
nfo
is all managed through the userspace page tables.

To make it possible to allow userspace to mmap() but not access memory (wit=
hout
redoing how the kernel fundamentally manages virtual=3D>physical mappings),=
 the
simplest approach is to install PTEs into userspace page tables, but never =
mark
them Present in hardware, i.e. prevent actually accessing the backing memor=
y.
This is is exactly what Kirill's series in link [3] below implemented.

Issues that led to us abandoning the "map with special !Present PTEs" appro=
ach:

 - Using page tables, i.e. hardware defined structures, to track gfn=3D>pfn=
 mappings
   is inefficient and inflexible compared to software defined structures, e=
specially
   for the expected use cases for CoCo guests.

 - The kernel wouldn't _easily_ be able to enforce a 1:1 page:guest associa=
tion,
   let alone a 1:1 pfn:gfn mapping.
=20
 - Does not work for memory that isn't backed by 'struct page', e.g. if dev=
ices
   gain support for exposing encrypted memory regions to guests.

 - Poking into the VMAs to convert memory would be likely be less performan=
t due
   to using infrastructure that is much "heavier", e.g. would require takin=
g
   mmap_lock for write.

In short, shoehorning this into mmap() requires fighting how the kernel wor=
ks at
pretty much every step, and in the end, adding e.g. fbind() is a lot easier=
.

#3 isn't entirely correct.  If a different process (call it "B") maps share=
d memory,
and then the guest converts that memory from shared to private, the backing=
 pages
for the previously shared mapping will still be mapped by process B unless =
userspace
also ensures process B also unmaps on conversion.

#3 is also a limiter.  E.g. if a guest is primarly backed by 1GiB pages, ke=
eping
the 1GiB mapping is desirable if the guest converts a few KiB of memory to =
shared,
and possibly even if the guest converts a few MiB of memory.
