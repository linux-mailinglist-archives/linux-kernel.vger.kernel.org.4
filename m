If the userspace component is not ready maybe this can be delayed for a
future patchset?
The basic features should already be useful with a generic client like
fwupd.
Doing it in steps should be faster both in development and wall time.

That sounds great.

I want to get a feeling for the exposed bios settings and how the
sure-start stuff works.

Maybe mention this in the commit message.

Also it would be useful to test the new driver with fwupd which is the
existing userspace user of this ABI.
Just to make sure that nothing is obviously broken there.
(And mention this in the commit message)
