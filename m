Bugh...

Returning EAGAIN has some unfortunate consequences that I've missed
until now...

The stage2 attr walker is used to handle faults as well as range-based
operations. In the former case, EAGAIN is sane as we retry execution but
the latter is not. I stupidly got hung up on write protection not
working as intended for some time.

I think that callers into the page table walker should indicate whether
or not the walk is to address a fault. If it is not,
__kvm_pgtable_visit() and __kvm_pgtable_walk() should chug along instead
of bailing for EAGAIN.

Let me mess around with this and figure out what is least ugly.
