Very interesting. I was under the assumption that everything that goes
on in sev_enable() in the decompressor would be rather indispensable
to boot in SEV mode (which I only spotted today) so I am quite
surprised that things just appear to work. (There is some 32-bit SEV
code in the decompressor as well that obviously never gets called when
booting in long mode, but I hadn't quite grasped how much other SEV
code there actually is)
