I am not saying that your patch is incorrect other than handling the 
partition case. However, it is rather complex and is hard to understand 
especially for those that are not that familiar with the cpuset code. 
 From the maintainability point of view, a simpler solution that is 
easier to understand is better.

If we want to get it into the next merge windows, there isn't much time 
left for linux-next testing. So a lower risk solution is better from 
that perspective too.

OK, I can remove the "TODO". I have no objection to that.

If we decide that we should always try to keep possible offline cpus in 
a task's cpumask. We could adopt your solution or we can try to keep 
that information in the cpuset structure itself. At this point, I don't 
see any advantage in doing that except for tasks in the top cpuset 
because the hotplug code won't update their cpumasks. Also inferring 
offline cpus that should be in the cpuset is only possible with cgroup 
v2. It does not work for v1. So it is also not a complete solution. To 
be complete, we may need keep this information in the cpuset.

Cheers,
Longman
