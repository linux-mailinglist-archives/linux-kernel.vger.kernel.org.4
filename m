Real L1 and L2. In this whole discussion L0 is Hyper-V, L1 is KVM and L2 is a Linux VM.

Noted. My concern here is about changing a default in a way that lowers performance,
because the proper fix that comes later might end up not being suitable for stable.

I agree with that. Right now L2 is broken, I've never even attempted L3 to
see if it would work.
