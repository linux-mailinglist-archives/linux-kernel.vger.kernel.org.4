Thx for this. In that case I'll move this issue to the list of
regression on the backburner -- and likely will remove it in a few
months while reminding everyone a final time about it. Sure, in an ideal
world this would be fixed, but tradeoffs like "latency vs throughput"
are always tricky -- and if this is only noticed now it's likely not
that common.

#regzbot title: ext4: 3% degradation in IOPS score, likely due to a
change that influences latency vs throughput

more of an research project than an easy fix
