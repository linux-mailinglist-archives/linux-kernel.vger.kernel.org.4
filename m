Hi Frank,

The platform devices exposed by this PCIe card are available via some=20
BAR using PCI memory mapped areas, so it's totally standard PCI stuff.

I'm not sure to understand what you mean here. PCI configuration headers
only provides some basic registers allowing to identify the PCI device
(vendor/product) and some memory areas that are exposed (BAR). They do
not provides the "list" of peripherals that are exposed by the devices,
only some BARs that can be mapped and that allows to access.

In the case of the lan9662 cnetwork controller, BAR 0 and 1 exposes
multiples devices that are located at some subranges of this BAR. For
instance (not accurate), we have the I2C controller located at BAR 0
+ offset 0X1000, then the flexcom controller exposed in BAR 0 at offset
  0x20000, etc. This list of peripheral is not exposed at all by the PCI
configuration headers (since it is not the purpose of course). All of
these peripherals have already existing platform drivers which can then
be reused thanks to the PCI device-tree overlay series.

You can probably read the cover letter which described the use case in=20
details. However, don't spend too much time reading the patchset, we
discarded them for many good reason (way too much modifications in
subsystems, no standardization of software node bindings, etc).
