From a user perspective none of this is clear from any of the
documentation I read.

Indeed that fixes things and makes things work *exactly* as one would
expect. The simple case of just editing a file and immediately comparing
sha1sum on the host and guest yields the exact same result.

In comparison using the default cache of loose... things are not what
you'd expect. The cache is completley useless even if you do a full
kernel compilation on the host. The guest will not get any updates at
all.

OK thanks, it seems we should probably help test 9p with fstests and get
a baseline, and then check to see how many tests actually do test cache
modes. If none exists, we should add some to test for each invalidation
strategy possible.

We can certainly use kdevops to help test this but I suspect that
since it relies on a client / host model it may make sense to share
some code for automation on bringup with what NFS folks are doing
with kdevops.

The documentation is not so clear what the pain is in terms of
performance.

Nice, thanks, since kdevops relies on a host kernel though and we strive
to have stability for that, I personally like to recommend distro
kernels and so they're a few kernel releases out of date. So debian-testing
is on 6.1 as of today for example.

So I'll go with the following for now on kdevops for now. This seems to
fix all the woes I had for now. Once a cache mode with proper testign
proves to pass most tests in fstests we can switch to it on kdevops.

BTW the qemu wiki seems to suggest cache=loose and its why I used it on
kdevops as a default. What about the following so to avoid folks running
into similar issues? I can go and update the wiki too.
