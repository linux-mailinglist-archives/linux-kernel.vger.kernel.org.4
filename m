I'll leave the BPF namespace discussion aside (I agree that it needs
way more thought).

I am a bit surprised that we require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for GET_NEXT_ID
operations. GET_FD_BY_ID is definitely CAP_SYS_ADMIN, as they allow
you to take over someone else's link and stuff like this. But just
iterating IDs seems like a pretty innocent functionality, so maybe we
should remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN for GET_NEXT_ID?

By itself GET_NEXT_ID is relatively useless without capabilities, but
we've been floating the idea of providing GET_INFO_BY_ID (not by FD)
for a while now, and that seems useful in itself, as it would indeed
help tools like bpftool to get *some* information even without
privileges. Whether those GET_INFO_BY_ID operations should return same
full bpf_{prog,map,link,btf}_info or some trimmed down version of them
would be up to discussion, but I think getting some info without
creating an FD seems useful in itself.

Would it be worth discussing and solving this separately from
namespacing issues?
