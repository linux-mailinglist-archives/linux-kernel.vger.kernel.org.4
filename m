Many thanks for your thought. :)

Sure, in this case a stack dump will be really helpful. We can gather these stack dumps
and try to make the most frequent machine check scene recoverable.

Agree. A stack dump won't be helpful in this case. But I tend to keep the stack dump in case
it would be helpful and also make mce_panic() dumps the stack as expected. What do you think?

Thanks,
