I read "OS natively comprehends MMCFG space" as meaning "the OS has
device-specific knowledge of the PCI host bridge and the associated
MMCFG space." But in that case, the OS wouldn't need MCFG at all, so
maybe I'm not reading it right.

There must have been some reason for that sentence, e.g., some system
that didn't or couldn't report MMCFG via PNP0C02 _CBA, but it sure
makes a mess of what could have been a simple "range must be reserved"
statement.

Probably none, and I think that's what we'll have to do.  Ugh.
Another random special-case rule.
