I forgot, what was the problem with doing the above?

I'm not totally against this, but I'd like to know the full issue its
solving. Perhaps I need to know more about what is being done, and what is
needed too.

It's to match avaliable_filter_functions

Another way is to add a tracing option to make the address show up in the
available_filter_functions file. That would be my preferred choice.

  echo 1 > options/available_filter_addrs

Or something like that.

Because it's part of ftrace, and that belongs in tracefs.

tracefs is not debugfs, as debugfs includes all things debuggy (and
considered not secure). tracefs is its own file system dedicated to the
tracing code in the kernel. It exists with CONFIG_DEBUG not defined, and
lives in /sys/kernel/tracing. The only reason /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
(which is a duplicate mount point) exists is for backward compatibility for
before tracefs existed. But that path really should be deprecated.

Is it really that big of an issue? Again, I'm not against this change, but
I'm just wondering how much of a burden is it relieving?

Or we could add an option to change it ;-)

Hmm, why not add the print here?

	if (iter->flags & FTRACE_ITER_ADDRS)
		seq_printf(m, "%lx ", rec->ip);

and not touch print_rec().
