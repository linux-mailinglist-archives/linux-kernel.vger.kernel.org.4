Toggling PID.SN as close to the world switch as possible is undesirable.  If KVM
re-enters the guest without enabling IRQs, i.e. handles the VM-Exit in the fastpath,
then the notification IRQ will be delivered in the guest.

The natural location to do the toggling is when KVM "toggles" software, i.e. when
KVM sets IN_GUEST_MODE (clear SN) and OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE (set SN).

I believe that would also obviate the need to manually send a PI Notification IRQ,
as the existing ->sync_pir_to_irr() call that exists to handle exactly this case
(notification not sent or handled in host) would ensure any outstanding posted IRQ
gets moved to the IRR and processed accordingly.

> Opportunistically clean up vmx_vcpu_pi_put(); when a vCPU is preempted,

Uh uh, this patch is already way, way too subtle and complex to tack on clean up.
"Opportunistic" clean up is for cases where the clean up is a pure refactoring
and/or has zero impact on functionality.

I'm pretty sure this is wrong.  If the vCPU is preempted between prepare_to_rcuwait()
and schedule(), then skipping pi_enable_wakeup_handler() will hang the guest if
the wakeup event is a posted IRQ and the event arrives while the vCPU is preempted.

The overhead is more than likely due to pi_is_pir_empty() in the VM-Entry path,
i.e. should in theory go away if PID.SN is clear/set at IN_GUEST_MODE and
OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE

Why?

Ah, sorry, missed v1.  Rather than key off of IN_GUEST_MODE in the sync path, add
an explicit kvm_x86_ops hook to perform the transition.  I.e. make it explict.

These exports will hopefully go away.

To handle the preempted case, I believe the correct behavior is to leave SN
as-is, although that would require setting SN=1 during vCPU creation.  Arguably
KVM should do that anyways when APICv is enabled.

Hmm, or alternatively this should do the same?

As much as I wish we could get rid of kvm_arch_vcpu_blocking(), I actually think
this would be a good application of that hook.  If PID.SN is cleared during
kvm_arch_vcpu_blocking() and set during kvm_arch_vcpu_unblocking(), then I believe
there's no need to manually check the PIR here, as any IRQ that isn't detected by
kvm_vcpu_check_block() is guaranteed to set PID.ON=1.

As above, I don't think skipping this for preempted is correct.

Assuming I'm correct, hoist the "note" above to document that KVM needs to enable
the wakeup handler even when the vCPU is preempted.

Should be unnecessary.
