Yeah, and I think reproducibility issue is another problem, which means
it's quite hard to select a random fs without some change to get the
best result.  I do find these guys work on e2fsprogs again and again.

I've already told them internally again and again, but.. They only focus
on some minor points such as how to do I/O and CPU prefetch to get
(somewhat) better performance and beat EROFS.  I don't know, I have no
enough time to even look into that whether this new kernel stuffs is
fine: because of a very simplist idea:

  stacked storage overhead generally takes double runtime/memory
footprints:
    filesystem + block drivers

Agreed, I hope you guys could actually sit down and evaluate a proper
solution on the next OCI v2, currently I know there are:

  - Composefs
  - (e)stargz   https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter
  - Nydus       https://github.com/containerd/nydus-snapshotter
  - OverlayBD   https://github.com/containerd/accelerated-container-image
  - SOCI        https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter
  - Tarfs
  - (maybe even more..)

Honestly, I do think OSTree/Composefs is the best approach for now for
deduplication and page cache sharing (due to kernel limitation of page
cache sharing and overlayfs copyup limitation).  I'm too tired of
container image stuffs honestly.  Too much unnecessary manpower waste.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
