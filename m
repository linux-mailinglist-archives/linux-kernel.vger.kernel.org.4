Right, but unless I am misunderstanding you, that is an extension for the
IOMMU spec, not for Chapter 9 of the AIA spec?

I would say that it is likely that if you have AIA and IOMMU that you'd
want to be implementing Chapter 9, but that would not appear sufficient to
draw a conclusion from.

Maybe the RVI lads that you've added (or Anup for that matter!) can
clarify if there is a requirement that if you do AIA and IOMMU that you
must do Chapter 9.
If not, my prior question about a differentiation mechanism still applies
I think!
