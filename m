I suspected a Linux problem (e.g., we messed up disabling/restoring
PTM).  That's why I was asking about your debug patch, to see if we
could find something wrong with Linux.

But if you also see the Unsupported Request errors on Windows, that
makes it more likely that it's a firmware issue.

I assume PTM was not enabled by firmware at boot-time (you might be
able to confirm this by tweaking early_dump_pci_device() to dump more
space and using "pci=earlydump").  If that's the case, it seems
strange that firmware would enable PTM at resume-time.

Linux *should* be disabling PTM at suspend-time, so firmware should
never see the fact that it had been enabled, so I don't know how it
could conclude that it's safe to enable PTM at resume-time.
