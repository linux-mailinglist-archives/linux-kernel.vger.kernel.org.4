Yeah, I got all that.  What I'm trying to say, and why I asked about whether or
not userspace controls the mappings, is that AFAIK there is nothing in the kernel
that coordinates mappings between VFIO and KVM.  So, very technically, userspace
could map a 2MiB range contiguous in VFIO but not in KVM, or RW in VFIO but RO in KVM.

I can't imagine there's a real use case for doing so, and arguably there's no
requirement that KVMGT honor KVM's memslot.  But because KVMGT taps into KVM's
page-tracking, KVMGT _does_ honor KVM's memslots to some extent because KVMGT
needs to know whether or not a given GFN can be write-protected.

I'm totally fine if KVMGT's ABI is that VFIO is the source of truth for mappings
and permissions, and that the only requirement for KVM memslots is that GTT page
tables need to be visible in KVM's memslots.  But if that's the ABI, then
intel_gvt_is_valid_gfn() should be probing VFIO, not KVM (commit cc753fbe1ac4
("drm/i915/gvt: validate gfn before set shadow page entry").

In other words, pick either VFIO or KVM.  Checking that X is valid according to
KVM and then mapping X through VFIO is confusing and makes assumptions about how
userspace configures KVM and VFIO.  It works because QEMU always configures KVM
and VFIO as expected, but IMO it's unnecessarily fragile and again confusing for
unaware readers because the code is technically flawed.

On a related topic, ppgtt_populate_shadow_entry() should check the validity of the
gfn.  If I'm reading the code correctly, checking only in ppgtt_populate_spt() fails
to handle the case where the guest creates a bogus mapping when writing an existing
GTT PT.

Combing all my trains of thought, what about this as an end state for this series?
(completely untested at this point).  Get rid of the KVM mapping size checks,
verify the validity of the entire range being mapped, and add a FIXME to complain
about using KVM instead of VFIO to determine the validity of ranges.
