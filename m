Inspired by Sean's reply yesterday a "nit on the bot" from my side, too:

Reports like this will sometimes generate a discussion, hence it IMHO
would be good if the bot would suggest to place a "Link:" tag to the
report itself right after the "Reported-by:" tag. That might be a bit
tricky, but with a bit of luck the bot might already know the msgid of
the msg it is about to sent, which makes it straight forward to predict
the link the report will later have in the lore archives.

To explain: These links make things easier for future code
archaeologists. That's why Linus[1] considers proper link tags important
and why our documentation for some time says to place tags in cases like
this, too[2].
