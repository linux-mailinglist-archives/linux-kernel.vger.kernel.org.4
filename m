Configuring the C-bit inside vm_sev_create_*() won't work (at least not well).
The C-bit needs to be known before kvm_vm_elf_load(), i.e. can't be handled after
__vm_create(), and needs to be tracked inside the VM, i.e. can't be handled before
__vm_create().

The proposed kvm_init_vm_address_properties() seems like the best fit since the
C-bit (and TDX's S-bit) is stolen from GPA space, i.e. directly affects the other
values computed in that path.

As for the kvm_vm_arch allocation ugliness, when we talked off-list I didn't
consider the need to allocate in kvm_init_vm_address_properties().  That's quite
gross, especially since the pointer will be larger than the thing being allocated.

With that in mind, adding .../include/<arch>/kvm_util.h so that "struct kvm_vm_arch"
can be defined and referenced directly doesn't seem so bad.  Having to stub in the
struct for the other architectures is annoying, but not the end of the world.
