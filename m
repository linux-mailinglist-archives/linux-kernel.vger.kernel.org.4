What duplicate commits?  As far as I know there aren't any.  My normal
practice is to send a secondary push to fix a few bug fixes targetted
for upcoming release (in this case, 6.3), and then I'll reset to -rc2
or -rc3 for patches that are targetted for the next merge window (in
this case, 6.4).

The data=writeback patches was dropped from dev before the pull
request, and won't show up on dev until they are ready for Linus.

Cheers,
