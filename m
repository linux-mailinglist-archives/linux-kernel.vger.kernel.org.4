I think it would be useful to handle special cases, for example you
could allow a process that created a file with memfd to use it, at the
condition that nobody else writes it.

This would be required during the boot, otherwise services could fail
to start (depending on the policy).

Ok, it is a well known issue. Hopefully, it will be fixed soon.

>   * Squash patch 05/12, 07/12, 09/12 to [10/16]
>   * Squash patch 08/12, 10/12 to [11/16]
>   * Change audit records to MAC region (14XX) from Integrity region (18XX)
>   * Add FSVerity Support
>   * Interface changes:
>       1. "raw" was renamed to "pkcs7" and made read only
>       2. "raw"'s write functionality (update a policy) moved to "update"
>       3. introduced "version", "policy_name" nodes.
>       4. "content" renamed to "policy"
>       5. The boot policy can now be updated like any other policy.
>   * Add additional developer-level documentation
>   * Update admin-guide docs to reflect changes.
>   * Kunit tests
>   * Dropped CONFIG_SECURITY_IPE_PERMISSIVE_SWITCH - functionality can
>     easily come later with a small patch.
>   * Use partition0 for block_device for dm-verity patch
> 
> v8:
>   * Add changelog information to individual commits
>   * A large number of changes to the audit patch.
>   * split fs/ & security/ changes to two separate patches.
>   * split block/, security/ & drivers/md/ changes to separate patches.
>   * Add some historical context to what lead to the creation of IPE
>     in the documentation patch.
>   * Cover-letter changes suggested by Roberto Sassu.
> 
> v9:
>   * Rewrite IPE parser to use kernel match_table parser.
>   * Adapt existing IPE properties to the new parser.
>   * Remove ipe_context, quote policy syntax, kernel_read for simplicity.
>   * Add new function in the security file system to delete IPE policy.
>   * Make IPE audit builtin and change several audit formats.
>   * Make boot_verified property builtin
>
