I was talking to Marc Zyngier earlier and he reckons the need for a
higher MAX_ORDER is the GIC driver ITS allocation for Thunder-X. I'm
happy to make ARCH_MAX_ORDER higher in defconfig (12, 13?) if
CONFIG_ARCH_THUNDER. Mobile vendors won't enable this platform.

Regarding EXPERT, we could drop it and do like the other architectures
but we'll have randconfig occasionally hitting weird values that won't
build (like -1). Not sure EXPERT helps here.
