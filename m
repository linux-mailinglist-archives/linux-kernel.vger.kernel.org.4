I think this is correct. My use case is to request from the kernel to
do demotion without reclaim in the cgroup, and the reason for that is
stated in the commit message:

"Reclaim and demotion incur different latency costs to the jobs in the
cgroup. Demoted memory would still be addressable by the userspace at
a higher latency, but reclaimed memory would need to incur a
pagefault."

For jobs of some latency tiers, we would like to trigger proactive
demotion (which incurs relatively low latency on the job), but not
trigger proactive reclaim (which incurs a pagefault). I initially had
proposed a separate interface for this, but Johannes directed me to
this interface instead in [1]. In the same email Johannes also tells
me that meta's reclaim stack relies on memory.reclaim triggering
demotion, so it seems that I'm not the first to take a dependency on
this. Additionally in [2] Johannes also says it would be great if in
the long term reclaim policy and demotion policy do not diverge.

My understanding is that with this interface in order to trigger
demotion I would want to list both the top tier nodes and the bottom
tier nodes on the nodemask, and since the bottom tier nodes are in the
nodemask the kernel will not just trigger demotion, but will also
trigger reclaim. This is very specifically not our use case and not
the goal of this patch.

I had also suggested adding a demotion= arg to memory.reclaim so the
userspace may customize this behavior, but Johannes rejected this in
[3] to adhere to the aging pipeline.

All in all I like Johannes's model in [3] describing the aging
pipeline and the relationship between demotion and reclaim. The nodes=
arg is just a hint to the kernel that the userspace is looking for
reclaim from a top tier node (which would be done by demotion
according to the aging pipeline) or a bottom tier node (which would be
done by reclaim according to the aging pipeline). I think this
interface is aligned with this model.
