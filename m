No, just make the driver opt-in to async probe. It's 1 flag to set for
the driver. Then the delay in your probe is not blocking other probes
and the whole probe for the driver happens in parallel. Then the delay
is only an issue if it is longer than all the other things
initializing during boot or if you are on a single core system.
Neither is likely true.
