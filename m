Well, I stole that phrase from someone else (gregkh).

I'm not aware of anyone except for DRM wanting the changelog in the 
final commits, but that's really a different issue.

I'm pretty sure no one will complain about a changelog in the patches. I 
guess you just have to duplicate it if you think it should be in both. 
b4 could be taught to do that I suppose. IMO, the cover letter should 
have a higher level changelog than the individual patches.
