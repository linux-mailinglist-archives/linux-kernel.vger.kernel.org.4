Hi Paolo, Marc, Eric and others,

Did you have a chance to take a look at this v3 patchset?

Just to remind the context: this patchset implements a solution I
proposed in [1], only that it doesn't introduce the additional "pending
oneshot" state (which was Marc's concern in [2]): I realized that this
extra state is not really needed, as we can just unconditionally notify
the resamplefd once again at unmask, with the same end result.
