I applied this series on next-20221108, which has the call depth
tracking patches, and I no longer see the panic when starting a guest on
my AMD test system and I can still start a simple nested guest without
any problems, which is about the extent of my regular KVM testing.  I
did test the same kernel on my Intel systems and saw no problems there
but that seems expected given the diffstat. Thank you for the quick
response and fixes!

One small nit I noticed: kvm-asm-offsets.h should be added to a
.gitignore file in arch/x86/kvm.

$ git status --short
?? arch/x86/kvm/kvm-asm-offsets.h

Cheers,
Nathan
