OK you got me there :)

The function name makes it pretty clear that it will round *up* to the
nearest power of 2 but you're right the comment should also make that
clear.

The initial wording implied that it would always over-allocate so yes I
think it's important to make it clear that it doesn't round up if it
doesn't need to.
