For system PMUs we'll pretty much always have a platform device 
corresponding to a DT/ACPI entry used to describe MMIO registers and/or 
interrupts. In many cases the PMU is going to be the only part of the 
underlying device that is meaningful to Linux anyway, so I don't see any 
issue with just hanging the PMU device off its corresponding platform 
device - it still gives the user a way to map a PMU instance back to 
some understandable system topology (i.e. ACPI/DT) to disambiguate, and 
that's the most important thing.

Thanks,
Robin.
