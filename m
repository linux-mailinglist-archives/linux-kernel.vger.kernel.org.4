Ah, I see. Thanks for explanation. But then the problem is deeper than just
a mismatch in number of reserved delalloc block. The problem really is that
if extent status tree update fails, we have inconsistency between what is
stored in the extent status tree and what is stored on disk. And that can
cause even data corruption issues in some cases.

So I think we rather need to work on handling of errors in extent status
tree operations. In the extent status tree, we have extents which we can
just drop without issues and extents we must not drop - this depends on the
extent's status - currently ext4_es_is_delayed() extents must stay, others
may be dropped but I'd wrap the decision in a helper function.

I'm currently inclined towards the following:

1) Removal must never fail. If we need to split extent, we use GFP_NOFAIL
if we cannot just drop the second part of the split extent in case of
allocation failure.

2) Similarly if inserting extent that cannot be dropped, we use GFP_NOFAIL.

3) We do not try to "undo" failed operations like we currently do - with
the above rules we never loose information that cannot be restored.

And this should also fix the problem you've hit because in case of
allocation failure we may just end up with removed extent from the extent
status tree and thus we refetch info from the disk and find out blocks are
already allocated.
