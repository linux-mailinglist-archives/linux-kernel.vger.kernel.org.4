I am not sure when you say stricter than needed.  Historically
file systems assumed that sectors are updated atomically i.e.
there is never a sector with a mixture of old and new data.
The eMMC spec does not guarantee that, except for reliable
write.

File systems may use REQ_FUA for important information, like the
superblock or a journal commit record, so using reliable write
for REQ_FUA would seem to give better protection against file system
corruption than a cache flush which could leave a sector
half-written.

On the other hand, sudden power loss is probably rare in battery
powered systems because they are designed to monitor the battery
power and shutdown when it gets too low.

And file systems can use checksums to detect half-written updates.

And there is anyway no protection for other (non REQ_FUA) writes a
file system might do and expect not to tear sectors.

And you are more likely to smash the screen than bounce the battery
out and cause an unrecoverable file system error.

Nevertheless, the commit message of this patch reads like the change
is an optimization, whereas it seems more like a policy change.
The commit message should perhaps say something like:
"The consensus is that the benefit of improved performance by not
using reliable-write for REQ_FUA is much greater than any potential
benefit that reliable-write might provide to avoid file system
corruption in the event of sudden power loss."

As for allowing for the policy to be overridden, perhaps an mmc_core
module option?

It is the natural conclusion though.  The eMMC probably does not
update mapping information with every write, instead if power is
lost, it scans the updated areas at the next initialization. (The
power-off notify feature would commit the mapping information to
media to avoid that).  So a reliable write might have to:
1. write information to record that the old mapping
should be used, not what might be discovered by scanning
2. do the actual write
3. write mapping information to record the new mapping
