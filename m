Right, if BIOS CSM puts EfiMemoryMappedIO in the E820 map the same way
bootloaders do, and the kernel doesn't have the EFI memory map, this
series won't help.

Yes, I agree CSM could still be broken if BIOS puts EfiMemoryMappedIO
in the E820 map.

I'm not clear on the grub cases.  Do some grub versions hide the EFI
memory map from the kernel?  If they do, they could be broken the same
way as CSM.

Yes, I'm afraid you're right.  Comparing the logs at comment #31
(fails) and comment #38 (works):

  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xdfa00000-0xfebfffff window]
  pci 0000:00:1c.0: BAR 14: assigned [mem 0xdfa00000-0xdfbfffff] fails
  pci 0000:00:1c.0: BAR 14: assigned [mem 0xdfb00000-0xdfcfffff] works

Since 0xdfa00000 is included in the host bridge _CRS, but isn't
usable, my guess is this is a _CRS bug.

Or maybe BIOS is using the producer/consumer bit in _CRS to identify
this as register space as opposed to a window?  I thought we couldn't
rely on that bit, but it's been a long time since I looked at it.  An
acpidump might have a clue.
