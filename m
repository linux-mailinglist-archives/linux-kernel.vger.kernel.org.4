I only see similar situation on ARM SMMUv3 platforms. The device ATS is
only allowed when the ATS bit is set in RC node of the ACPI/IORT table.

It's irrelevant to untrusted devices.

Untrusted devices, with pci_dev->untrusted set, means device connects to
the system through some kind of untrusted external port, e.g.
thunderbolt ports. For those devices, ATS shouldn't be enabled for those
devices.

Here we are talking about soc-integrated devices vs. discrete PCI
devices (connected to the system through internal PCI slot). The problem
is that the DMAR ACPI table only defines ATS attribute for Soc-
integrated devices, which causes ATS (and its ancillary features) on the
discrete PCI devices not to work.

For example, users might purchase general servers and use their own or
third-party PCIe adapters on them. They have no means to customize the
BIOS.
