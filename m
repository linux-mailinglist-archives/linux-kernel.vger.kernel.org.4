Nothing special at all in the userspace.

I think details of my test bed might be in some other thread from when
that original patch went in or when the original bug report came, but
from memory, I believe what I did to reliably reproduce various issues
was comment out the sleep in random.c so that it keeps asking the TPM
for more bytes from the kthread, like this:

diff --git a/drivers/char/random.c b/drivers/char/random.c
index ce3ccd172cc8..708110c780aa 100644

 /*
  * Handle random seed passed by bootloader, and credit it depending
  * on the command line option 'random.trust_bootloader'.
  */
 void __init add_bootloader_randomness(const void *buf, size_t len)
 {

Then I hooked the tpm emulator up to qemu and put it in tpm1 mode. I had
userspace `echo mem > /sys/power/state` every couple of seconds (or
continuously maybe?), and then I used the qemu monitor interface to wake
the system from sleep. And kaboom.
