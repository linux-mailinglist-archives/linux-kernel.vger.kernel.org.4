Yes, pretty much.

So how was this supposed to work on his system?

If you have a system with two different memory controllers and you want
to have two different EDAC drivers for each, then the whole EDAC core
code needs to be audited wrt concurrency and synchronizing access to
its facilities because I don't think it has ever supported more than a
single EDAC driver per system.

And it has never needed to, at least not on x86 land. Which is
currently changing because of CXL, because of accelerators needing
RAS, GPUs needing RAS and so on and so on. So eventually we'd have to
either put the new RAS functionality in the existing chipset-specific
driver or have to go the multiple EDAC drivers route. But that's only
tangential...

So first I'd like to hear what your use case is: single EDAC driver for
your particular Baical-T1 device or you need to support multiple EDAC
drivers.

If so, why?

See above.

If by that you mean the aspect of a driver associating with a device and
performing operations with it then why do you assume that EDAC drivers
have to adhere to that model?

Lemme reply to it directly.

Yes, I have read it and it contains a lot of unnecessary detail which
should be in the respective patches themselves. And I still don't know
exactly what *you* are trying to do, as I said above.

A cover letter should contain a short executive summary explaining only
the goal of the patchset and then you can go into details if you prefer.
A reviewer should not have to dig into patch management details to know
what this patchset is trying to do.

A possible structure could be:

Problem is A.

It happens because of B.

Fix it by doing C.

(Potentially do D).

Btw, when you're writing your commit messages, please use passive voice
in your commit message: no "we" or "I", etc, and describe your changes
in imperative mood.

Thx.
