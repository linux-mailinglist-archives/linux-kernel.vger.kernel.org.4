I'll post a v2 that removes only regions 256KB or larger in a minute.

Just trying to follow along here, so not sure any of the following is
relevant ...

This attachment is from
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2029207, and it shows:

  efi: mem46: [MMIO|RUN|  ] range=[0xdfa00000-0xdfa0ffff] (0MB) [64K]
  efi: mem47: [MMIO|RUN|UC] range=[0xf80f8000-0xf80f8fff] (0MB)  [4K]
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xdfa00000-0xfebfffff window]
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xfed40000-0xfed4bfff window]

mem46 is included in the PNP0A08 _CRS, and Ivan has verified
experimentally that we have to avoid it.

mem47 is also included in the _CRS, but I don't have a clue what it
is.  Maybe some hidden device used by BIOS but not visible to us?

I don't know what bug this attachment is from.

Is the point here that you considered doing the E820 removal based on
the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME memory *attribute* instead of the
EFI_MEMORY_MAPPED_IO memory *type*?

I don't really know the details of EFI_MEMORY_MAPPED_IO vs
EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME, but it looks like EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME can be
applied to things like EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES_CODE (not MMIO space) that
should stay in E820.
