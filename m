Good catch, I was using 'efi=noruntime' on the CRD so I did not notice
that race.

I think it would be best to avoid that if we can, but that should work.

The problem here is that the firmware claims to support the EFI variable
services even when it clearly does not and the corresponding callbacks
just return EFI_UNSUPPORTED. As far as I understand, this is still spec
compliant though so we just need to handle that.

One way to address this could be to have efi core not register the
default efivars ops in this case. That would require checking that the
services are indeed available by making one of those calls during
initialisation.

This would however expose the fact that the Google SMI implementation
implicitly relies on overriding the default ops, but I think that's a
good thing as what we have now is racy in multiple ways.

Instead I think we should move the efivarfs availability check from
module init to mount time. That should allow the Google driver, and your
SCM implementation, to continue to be built as modules.

Any consumers (e.g. the Qualcomm RTC driver) would instead need to
check if efivars is available or else defer probe.

Alternatively, it seems all efivars implementation would need to be
always-built in which is not ideal for generic kernels.

I just posted a series here as food for thought:
