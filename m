Thanks for this info, it helps a lot.

I actually don't have references to any previous PCI devices that are
based on FPGAs, let alone with a high frequency of images changing.

The Alveo devices are the first such devices that have come to my
attention.  Note that this is a technology space that I do not
follow, so my lack of awareness does not mean much.

I do not remember the specific discussion that was asserting or
desiring a high frequency of image changes for an FPGA.  The
current overlay architecture and overall device tree architecture
would not handle this well and/or robustly because (off the top of
my head, hopefully I'm getting this correct) the live system device
tree does not directly contain all of the associated data - some of
it is contained in the unflattened device tree (FDT) that remains in
memory after unflattening, both in the case of the base system device
tree and overlay device trees.  Some of the device tree data APIs return
pointers to this data in the FDT.  And the API does not provide reference
counting for the data (just reference counting for nodes - and these
reference counts are know to be frequently incorrect).

In general I have very little visibility into the FPGA space so I go
out of my way to notify them before making changes to the overlay
implementation, API, etc; listen carefully to their input; and give
them lots of opportunity to test any resulting changes.
