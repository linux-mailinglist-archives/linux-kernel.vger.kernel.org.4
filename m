Except that it is not used in all transitions; see the callers oif
pci_power_up() for example.

Technically, the config space should become accessible right after
acpi_pci_set_power_state() has transitioned the device into D0 and it
should be accessible still right before acpi_pci_set_power_state()
attempts to transition the device into a low-power state, so it looks
like _REG could be evaluated from there.
