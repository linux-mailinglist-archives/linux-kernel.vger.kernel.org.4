That does look plausible to me.

And yes, RCU really cares about whether its part of this counter has
been a multiple of two during a given interval of time, because this
indicates that the CPU has no pre-existing RCU readers still active.
One way that this can happen is for that value to be a multiple of two
at some point in time.  The other way that this can happen is for the
value to have changed.  No matter what the start and end values, if they
are different, the counter must necessarily have at least passed through
multiple of two in the meantime, again guaranteeing that any RCU readers
that around when the count was first fetched have now finished.

But we should take the machine's opinions much more seriously than we
take any of our own opinions.  Why not adjust RCU_DYNTICKS_IDX so as
to crank RCU's portion of this counter down to (say) two or three bits
and let rcutorture have at it on TREE04 or TREE07, both of which have
nohz_full CPUs?

Maybe also adjust mkinitrd.sh to make the user/kernel transitions more
frequent?

Please note that I do -not- recommend production use of a three-bit
(let alone a two-bit) RCU portion because this has a high probability
of excessively extending grace periods.  But it might be good to keep
a tiny counter as a debug option so that we regularly rcutorture it.

							Thanx, Paul
