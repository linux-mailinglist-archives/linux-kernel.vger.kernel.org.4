Basically just don't touch the coherent mask. The eDMA drivers can still 
set the streaming mask to something larger, and that's the one that's 
going to matter for most dmaengine clients anyway. Even if someone does 
call dma_alloc_coherent() for their eDMA channel, it's not going to make 
much practical difference if that has to come from a DMA zone, unless 
the system is under severe memory pressure anyway.

Thanks,
Robin.
