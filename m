Yes, QEMU will probably clear it, but GRUB, shim, etc do a terrible
job at implementing image loading correctly, i.e., not bothering to
parse the PE/COFF header at all, but just copying the image into
memory and invoke it at a fixed offset of 0x290 bytes into the image
(the famous EFI handover protocol, see the last patch in this series
if you want to know more :-))

This also means that the balance of the file size vs the image size
(where BSS lives) is completely ignored, and we actually have to
relocate the image from the EFI stub in such cases, because we cannot
be sure that the BSS does not overlap with memory that is already in
use, given the top down allocation strategy the EFI usually employs.

In summary, I guess there are multiple way how we might end up in this
situation, and simply putting the variable back into .data where it
came from is probably the best approach here.
