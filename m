Hi Frank,

The driver has slightly evolved to be based on Lizhi Patches and the
interrupt driver was reworked to be a standard platform driver. I'll
clean that up and push a new branch based on this work.

This driver is indeed the driver for the LAN9662 Ethernet Controller
which allows using the 2 SFPs ports and 2 RJ45 ports successfully (which
involves multiple subsystem and drivers).

While doing this work, I found multiple of_noderefcount issues which I
fixed and that are currently being reviewed. I won't be surprised if
there are other lying around in various part of the kernel. Just saying
so you know there is actually effort to make that more robust.
