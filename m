Well, I already updated it a few moths ago, but yeah, will revisit the
docs and make it even clearer if needed (I assume that's the case).

Good idea. FWIW, the section patch 3 changes has a space here as well:
```
> } elsif ($rawlines[$linenr] !~ /^\s*signed-off-by:\s*(.*)/i) {
```
Hence I guess I'll remove it as well, unless you for some reason tell me
that's a bad idea.

Also a good idea. That being said:

I think I'll drop this check, as your comment made me think: why should
we check for "https?://" here at all? If we want to check that a "Link:"
is followed by a URI, then we should do that all the time, not just in
this single case.

Or am I missing something?
