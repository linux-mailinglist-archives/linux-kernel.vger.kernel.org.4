Hmmm. Not sure. Every special case makes things harder for humans and
software that looks at a commits downstream. Clicking on a link also
makes things easy for code archaeologists that might look into the issue
months or years later (which might not even know how to find the report
and potential discussions on lore from the syzbot report ID).

Hence, wouldn't it be better to ask the syzbot folks to change their
reporting slightly and suggest something like this instead in their
reports (the last line is the new one):

```
IMPORTANT: if you fix the issue, please add the following tag to the commit:
Reported-by: syzbot+bba886ab504fcafecafe@syzkaller.appspotmail.com
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/cafecaca0cafecaca0cafecaca0@google.com/
```

This might not be to hard if they known the message-id in advance. Maybe
they could even use the syzbot report ID as msg-id to make things even
easier. And for developers not much would change afaics, they just need
to copy and paste two lines instead of one.

Yeah, right now I most of the time stay away from CI reports and leave
the tracking to the people that run the CI (unless it's something I
consider worth tracking), but I hope that might change over time to have
things in one place.

Thx for saying this!

Ciao, Thorsten
