Huh, I've never seen this deadlock with vfio-pci-zdev or vfio-ap, but I see what you're saying...  I guess it's not seen under typical circumstances with QEMU because kvm_vfio_group_del would have already been triggered via KVM_DEV_VFIO_GROUP_DEL by the time we close the device, such that the group would not be found during the kvm_vfio_destroy call?  (I'm not at all suggesting that we should rely on userspace behaving in this order, just wondering why I never saw it while testing)

Yeah, this is also what I was thinking, replace the direct kvm_put_kvm calls with, say, schedule_delayed_work in each driver, where the delayed task just does the kvm_put_kvm (along with a brief comment explaining why we handle the put asynchronously).

Other than that..  The goal of this patch originally was to get the kvm reference at first open_device and release it with the very last close_device, so the only other option I could think of would be to take the responsibility back from the vfio drivers and do the kvm_get_kvm and kvm_put_kvm directly in vfio_main after dropping the  (but that would result in some ugly symbol linkage and would acquire kvm references that a driver maybe does not care about so I don't really like that idea)
