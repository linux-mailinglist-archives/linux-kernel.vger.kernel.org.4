Implementing 1) in itself requires more than simply splitting this
patch. And I don't think we should be making life harder for developers,
as well as users assisting during debugging, by going in that direction.

We have tons of modules in the kernel and very few that cannot be
unloaded. Anyone who doesn't trust root to not unload modules can
always disable unloading completely using CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD.
