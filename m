Yes, this is understood. But it is not really clear to me why would any
draining be necessary for such an isolated CPU if no workload other than
the RT (which pressumably doesn't charge any memory?) is running on that
CPU? Is that the RT task during the initialization phase that leaves
that cache behind or something else? Sorry for being so focused on this
but I would like to understand on whether this is avoidable by a
different startup scheme or it really needs to be addressed in some way.

Yeah, I am not supper happy about additional spin lock TBH. One
potential way to go would be to completely avoid pcp cache for isolated
CPUs. That would have some performance impact of course but on the other
hand it would give a more predictable behavior for those CPUs which
sounds like a reasonable compromise to me. What do you think?
