My point is: time is different. When KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP is there,
there was *only* one vendor and SEV/SNP didn't know how the future vendor
is going to use the ioctl. That is a reasonable case an generic ioctl can
have one vendor to back up.

The background here is: now another vendor is coming and there are going to
be two vendors. The two vendors' flows are much clearer than early stage.
Like, they know which flow is going to be used by each other.

With these kept in mind, IMHO, it is not appropriate to introduce
an generic ioctl that only one vendor is going to use, meanwhile
we have already known another vendor is not going to use it.

Defining a new userspace ABI is a serious thing and it is not an early
stage anymore. Actually I think it is the best time to see how the
code infrastructure should be re-purposed at this time.

I am not opposed to this option as it shows effort to improve it and it
is constructive. But this needs to be figured out with AMD folks and
maintainers. E.g. what should be the best CC ioctl scheme for KVM?
vendor-specific or generic, which brings better benefit for the userspace,
and less maintenance burden.

Back to the reason why I think a vendor-specific sysinfo interface for TDX
is necessary:

1) SEV driver has been there for quite some time. Unless people thinks an
generic CC ioctl scheme is a way to go, then there will be motivation and
efforts putting on it. The efforts is not only about wrapping SEV ioctls,
it needs a systematic spec of generic CC ioctl scheme. 

2) TDX doesn't have a driver like SEV and possibly not going to have one in
the future. For those non-KVM related control flow of TDX in future, they
can re-use this and stay away from KVM interface. (If vendor-specific
scheme is the future direction.)

I am afraid that in this case it is avoidable right?
