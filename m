Yes, it was correct when introduced by commit bb38919ec56e for a goo =
reason.
And it was broken by bde4a5a00e76 an all attempts later made it worse.

It fixes all between bde4a5a00e76 and HEAD. Well, one can argue that
commit bde4a5a00e76 could be sufficient for Fixes:

I don't know if it is a problem because I have no overview over =
side-effects.

As far as I know the reasons why imprecise aborts occur may be SoC =
specific.

So I have no experience with i.MX6 to judge this. My goal is to shield =
other
architectures from this fault handler may it be correct or wrong.

Yes, at least if it is triggered on OMAP4/OMAP5 by accessing =
non-existing
registers in some subsystems (e.g. through devmem2).

Well, I used it for debugging, but for production code it has indeed no =
benefit.

of_find_matching_node it is just a static inline wrapper for
of_find_matching_node_and_match with NULL parameter, but we can save one =
stack position.

I'll send a v2 soon.
