Yeah. And it's probably fine if we don't, I just wanted to see some
explanation on the long-term plan.
If the purpose is to have a bpf namespace and use it for pure
isolation purposes, let's state it clearly in the cover letter.
Otherwise it's not clear whether it's only about isolation or
potentially allowing CAP_BPF in user namespaces.
Maybe clone(CLONE_NEWBPF|CLONE_NEWUSER) should return an explicit
error? (or maybe it already does, haven't looked at the patches)

One other question I have is: should init bpf namespace see
everything? Otherwise it might be hard to chase down the namespaces
that loaded some BPF program...
