it can be both, the fprobe/ftrace filter setup will take care of looking
up and translating the provided address to the patch-side address

that's tricky because on x86 with IBT we would need to read the first
instruction and check if it's endbr to get the real address, like we
do in get_entry_ip:

	#ifdef CONFIG_X86_KERNEL_IBT
	static unsigned long get_entry_ip(unsigned long fentry_ip)
	{
		u32 instr;

		/* Being extra safe in here in case entry ip is on the page-edge. */
		if (get_kernel_nofault(instr, (u32 *) fentry_ip - 1))
			return fentry_ip;
		if (is_endbr(instr))
			fentry_ip -= ENDBR_INSN_SIZE;
		return fentry_ip;
	}
	#else
	#define get_entry_ip(fentry_ip) fentry_ip
	#endif


I'm not familiar with arm implementation, so I'm not sure if there's
a way to do this

but in any case Steven wants to keep the patch-side address:
