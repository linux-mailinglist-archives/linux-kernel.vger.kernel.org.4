Ou, you are right. Correct interpretation is "depends on 32-bit mvebu".
And because ARCH_MVEBU means "32-bit mvebu OR 64-bit mvebu" there is
additional "depends on ARM" to filter-out 64-bit mvebu.

So _architecture_ dependency based on intention should be:

(ARCH_MVEBU && ARM) || ARCH_DOVE || COMPILE_TEST

But because there is no 64-bit Dove, it has same meaning as moving ARM
from inner conjunction to outer.

I do not know which syntax is better. So choose what you prefer (current
version or some modification).
