As you might expect, we are working on a SIMD implementation of LEA in a
general-purpose CPU environment. However, since no such implementation has
been submitted yet, we agree that it's right to leave it out for now.

In the next version, we would like to change the description to the
following:

LEA is a South Korean 128-bit block cipher (with 128/192/256-bit keys)
included in the ISO/IEC 29192-2:2019 standard (Information security -
Lightweight cryptography - Part 2: Block ciphers). If dedicated cipher
instructions are available, or other options with performance benefits
are available, using LEA is likely not a suitable choice. Therefore,
it is not recommended to use LEA-256-XTS unless there is a clear reason
to do so, such as if there is a mandate. Also, to enable LEA support,
it needs to be enabled in the kernel crypto API.
