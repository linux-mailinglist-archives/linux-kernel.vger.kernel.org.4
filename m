And on small systems, you might of course have the rcuog kthread directly
invoke callbacks if there are not very many of them.  This would of
course need to be done quite carefully to avoid any number of races
with the rcuoc kthreads.  You could do the same thing on a large system,
but on a per-rcuog basis.

I vaguely recall discussing this in one of our sessions, but who knows?

Would this really be of benefit?  Or did you have something else in mind?
