Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

This is apparently is a regression and thus got on my radar.

This all sounds a bit unfortunate. What can we do to get this properly
solved? Which commit actually causes this? I wonder if poking maintainer
higher in the hierarchy might help getting this finally fixed.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
