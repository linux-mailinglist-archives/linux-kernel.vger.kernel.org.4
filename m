There's not much need of knowing the specifics of a card, but there might
be a need of knowing the workload to determine what allocation limits to set.

I've left region to be implementation specific, but it would make sense to
standardise it.
TTM, the layer used by drivers that support VRAM, have the following regions:
* sysmem - All system memory allocated; includes evicted VRAM.
* mapped - All physical system memory that is mapped to the GPU, when unbound
           moves to sysmem. When evicting VRAM to sysmem, it's temporarily
           mapped here.
* vramN - All VRAM regions of the device.
* driver specific regions - probably doesn't make sense to put in cgroup at all,
  this includes stolen from the PoC.

That leaves the question, what regions would make sense for a cgroup?
Since vramN can be moved to mapped and sysmem (VRAM eviction, suspend/resume,
driver_madvise), it becomes a subject of debate if we should include the other
regions, since things become complicated fast.

For the first iteration, I focus on a single category, vramN.

Even when not knowing anything about a GPU, it will be easy to partition its
memory like that.

If you can assign a weight for the scheduler, then you can also partition it's
vram by parsing /drm.capacity for total amount, and then splitting it across
cgroups.

Most GPU's have dedicated vram that works roughly in the same way, some
integrated chips like i915 or arm use shared memory from the host system
only. I would say amd, nvidia and intel's chips with dedicated memory work
roughly in the same way for vram.

I hope this explains it a little bit more,
