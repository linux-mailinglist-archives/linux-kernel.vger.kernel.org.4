1) Application which is not time sensitive executes on isolated CPU,
with memcg control enabled. Per-CPU stock is created.

2) App with memcg control enabled exits, per-CPU stock is not drained.

3) Latency sensitive application starts, isolated per-CPU has stock to
be drained, and:

/*
 * Drains all per-CPU charge caches for given root_memcg resp. subtree
 * of the hierarchy under it.
 */
static void drain_all_stock(struct mem_cgroup *root_memcg)
{
        int cpu, curcpu;

        /* If someone's already draining, avoid adding running more workers. */
        if (!mutex_trylock(&percpu_charge_mutex))
                return;
        /*
         * Notify other cpus that system-wide "drain" is running
         * We do not care about races with the cpu hotplug because cpu down
         * as well as workers from this path always operate on the local
         * per-cpu data. CPU up doesn't touch memcg_stock at all.
