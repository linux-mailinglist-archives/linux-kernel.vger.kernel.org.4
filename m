Each sbat CSV file line has following fields:

  component_name: the name we're comparing
  component_generation: the generation number for the comparison
  vendor_name: human readable vendor name
  vendor_package_name: human readable package name
  vendor_version: human readable package version (maybe machine parseable too, not specified here)
  vendor_url: url to look stuff up, contact, whatever.

So 'linux' is 'component_name' and '1' is component_generation

AFAICT beyond being "human readable package version", it is a fairly
arbitrary decision. A release version number for formal releases, or
a 'git describe' version string for git snapshots both satisfy the
versioning requirement IMHO.

The PE files are signed by the vendor who builds them, using their
SecureBoot signing key. The data covered by the signature includes
the '.sbat' section.

IOW, if you binary edit the section, the SecureBoot signature
verification fails and the kernel won't be booted.

That's simply what the spec defines as the approach.

The PE file format used by EFI applications has multiple
sections and the spec has declare that the '.sbat' section
is where this data shall live.

First it identifies the data format, and second if a
problem is ever discovered with the  SBAT concept,
a fixed approach can be indicated by changing to
'sbat,2,.....' and thus have the effect of revoking
use of any binaries which declare the 'sbat,1,....'
version. Pretty unlikely this will happen, but a useful
backup plan/safety net.

It is hard to predict the future, but my gut feeling is very infrequently.

I can't say I recall any specific Linux bugs that would warrant it, but
those involved in Linux/Bootloade/SecureBoot world can probably answer
this better than me. IIUC, the scope of bugs relevent to this is quite
narrow.

If applicable, yes.

Everything involved in the boot path is covered by signatures, so if
SecureBoot is enabled you can't simply build custom binaries. They
won't run unless you modify your EFI firmware config to trust your
own signing keys. If a user wants to compromise their own machine in
that way, that's fine.

Lets say Fedora applied a non-upstream kernel patch that compromised
SecureBoot. Upstream Linux has no reason to change their SBAT component
generation number. Instead Fedora would change their 'linux.fedora'
component generation number to reflect their own mistake.

My understanding is that CVEs in general would not apply in this
scenario, the scope of bugs that are impactful is reasonably
narrow. I'll defer to people more experienced in SecureBoot though
if they have a better answer.
