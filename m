Many thanks for your quick reply. :)

As you mentioned in [1]:
"""
In order to ease the hunt for additional code flows where machine check
errors can be recovered it is useful to know, for example, why the
kernel was copying a page.
"""

So I think it's better to have at least one stack dumps. Also what the commit
6e6f0a1f0fa6 ("panic: don't print redundant backtraces on oops") and commit
026ee1f66aaa ("panic: fix stack dump print on direct call to panic()") want
to do is avoiding nested stack-dumping to have the original oops data being
scrolled away on a 80x50 screen but to have *at least one backtraces*. So
this patch acts more like a BUGFIX to ensure having at least one backtraces
in mce_panic(). What's your thought, Luck?

Thanks,
Miaohe Lin
