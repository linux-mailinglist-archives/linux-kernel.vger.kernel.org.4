No.  Again, KVM _should never_ manipulate VMX MSRs in response to CPUID changes.
Keeping the existing behavior would be done purely to maintain backwards
compability with existing userspace, not because it's strictly the right thing to do.

E.g. as a strawman, a weird userspace could do KVM_SET_MSRS => KVM_SET_CPUID =>
KVM_SET_CPUID, where the first KVM_SET_CPUID reset to a base config and the second
KVM_SET_CPUID incorporates "optional" features.  In that case, clearing bits in
the VMX MSRs on the first KVM_SET_CPUID would do the wrong thing if the second
KVM_SET_CPUID enabled the relevant features.

AFAIK, no userspace actually does something odd like that, whereas there are VMMs
that do KVM_SET_MSRS before KVM_SET_CPUID, e.g. disable a feature in VMX MSRs but
later enable the feature in CPUID for L1.  And so disabling features is likely
safe-ish, but enabling feature most definitely can cause problems for userspace.

Hrm, actually, there are likely older VMMs that never set VMX MSRs, and so dropping
the "enable features" code might not be safe either.  Grr.  The obvious solution
would be to add a quirk, but maybe we can avoid a quirk by skipping KVM's
misguided updates if userspace has set the MSR.  That should work for a userspace
that deliberately sets the MSR during setup, and for a userspace that blindly
migrates the MSR since the migrated value should already be correct/sane.

No, it's correct.  The EXITING controls are just inverted feature flags.  E.g. if
RDRAND is disabled in CPUID, KVM sets the EXITING control so that KVM intercepts
RDRAND in order to inject #UD.
