You are very right. I am able to also trigger the warning with a synthetic
program that just mremaps a range and moves it in the same way that triggers
this issue, however I had to hack the kernel to prevent mremap from erroring
out if ranges overlap (unlike exec, mremap does some initial checks for
that). Also had to do other hacks but I did reproduce it consistently.

The issue is that even though the PMD is empty, it is allocated. So
pmd_none() is kind of a lie in some sense, it is pointing to empty PTEs when
the range is really empty.

How about we replace the warning with something like the following?

+       if (unlikely(!pmd_none(*new_pmd))) {
+               // Check if any ptes in the pmd are non-empty. Doing this here
+               // is ok since this is not a fast path.
+               bool pmd_empty = true;
+               unsigned long tmp_addr = new_addr;
+               pte_t* check_pte = pte_offset_map(new_pmd, new_addr);
+
+               new_ptl = pte_lockptr(mm, new_pmd);
+               spin_lock_nested(new_ptl, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING);
+               for (; tmp_addr < old_addr + PMD_SIZE; check_pte++, tmp_addr += PAGE_SIZE) {
+                       if (!pte_none(*check_pte)) {
+                               pmd_empty = false;
+                               break;
+                       }
+               }

+               WARN_ON_ONCE(!pmd_empty);
+               spin_unlock(new_ptl);
+       }
+

Exactly.

I actually didn't follow what you meant by "mutually PMD-aligned". Could you
provide some example address numbers to explain?

AFAIK, only 2MB aligned memory addresses can be directly addressed by a PMD.
Otherwise how will you index the bytes in the 2MB page? You need bits in the
address for that.

Just to mention, mremap errors out if you try to move overlapping ranges
because this in  mremap_to():

       /* Ensure the old/new locations do not overlap
        if (addr + old_len > new_addr && new_addr + new_len > addr) {
                pr_err("%s: (%s) (%d)", __func__, __FILE__, __LINE__);
                goto out;
        }

Or is there an mremap trick I might be missing which actually allows
overlapping range moves?

thanks,
