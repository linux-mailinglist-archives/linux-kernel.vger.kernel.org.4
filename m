The pci_device_group() path handles this like below:

/*
  * For multifunction devices which are not isolated from each other, find
  * all the other non-isolated functions and look for existing groups.  For
  * each function, we also need to look for aliases to or from other devices
  * that may already have a group.
  */
static struct iommu_group *get_pci_function_alias_group(struct pci_dev 
*pdev,
                                                         unsigned long 
*devfns)
{
         struct pci_dev *tmp = NULL;
         struct iommu_group *group;

         if (!pdev->multifunction || pci_acs_enabled(pdev, REQ_ACS_FLAGS))
                 return NULL;

It seems that all devices of an MFD shares a single iommu group if
there lacks ACS control.
