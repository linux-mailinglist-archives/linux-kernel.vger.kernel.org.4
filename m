Heh, I actually wrote that helper yesterday for v2, but as an internal 
check for valid ops :)

The current implementation of device_iommu_mapped() just dates back to 
when dev->iommu_group was the only per-device thing we had, so in 
principle I don't have any conceptual objection to redefining it in 
terms of "device has ops" rather than "device has a group", but as 
things stand you'd still have to do something about PPC first (I know 
Jason had been pushing on that, but I've not kept track of where it got to).

Thanks,
Robin.
