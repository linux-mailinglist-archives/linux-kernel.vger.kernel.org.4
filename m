Sounds good.

dev_dbg() wouldn't be the right thing if we *expect* the link to come
up, but ISTR that maybe you can't detect device presence directly.  If
that's the case, all you can do is try to bring the link up and assume
the slot is empty if it doesn't come up.  If the usual reason for the
timeout is that the slot is empty, dev_dbg() should be fine.

Another drive-by comment, no action needed, seems slightly strange to
have two "start_link" functions called one after the other:

  cdns_pcie_host_setup
    cdns_pcie_start_link
    cdns_pcie_host_start_link

I assume both are for the same link, so it's weird to have two
functions for it.
