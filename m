I was looking at this recently and I am wondering whether we should worry about VM_SHARE
vmas. 

ie, page_to_policy() can just reverse lookup just one VMA and fetch the policy right?
if it VM_SHARE it will be a shared policy we can find using vma->vm_file? 

For non anonymous and anon vma not having any policy set  it is owning task vma->vm_mm->owner task policy ? 
We don't worry about multiple tasks that can be possibly sharing that page right?

I guess vma policy is important. Applications want to make sure that they don't
have variable performance and they go to lengths to avoid that by using MEM_BIND.
So if they access the memory they always know access is satisfied from a specific
set of NUMA nodes. Swapin can cause performance impact but then all continued
access will be from a specific NUMA nodes. With slow memory demotion that is
not going to be the case. Large in-memory database applications are observed to
be sensitive to these access latencies.
