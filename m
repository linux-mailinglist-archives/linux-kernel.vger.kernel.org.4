We are running 5.15.75 (LTS) but the problem started when we upgraded 
from 5.15.31 to 5.15.59 and is present ever since. I erroneously said 
that it's present into every 5.15.

I didn't do my homework well and blamed the commit by Yu-cheng Yu. But 
this commit never landed into 5.15, nor the fix commit that you 
referred. There are no functions fpu__clear_all(), 
copy_init_fpstate_to_fpregs(), copy_user_to_xstate() anywhere in the 
sources of 5.15.75 or 5.15.31, so the 5.15 kernel is running with a 
different FPU implementation.

Additionally, I tested the reproducer on older 5.15 kernels and on the 
super-stable 4.14.256. They all emit the same "dmesg" error, so the 
reproducer is not reliable to detect our problem.

I am sorry for wasting your time.

That's our only option, it seems. Thank you.

Best regards.
