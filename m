Yeah, that's the usual state of affair. Unrealistic platforms, no
insight (and more generally no interest) in the actual usage model.

Still, most people got it right, so I guess they must be reading the
spec. How comes this was never picked from contributions to TF-A?
Surely duplication of platform code should be a massive hint to the
firmware maintainers?
