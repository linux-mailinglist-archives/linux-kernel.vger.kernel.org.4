AFAIR, it checks all kernel.org repos, but anything outside should be
manually added. See:
https://github.com/intel/lkp-tests/pull/271

I actually proposed a talk around this for LPC, so it seems it might be
useful.

If you setup specific repo entry in LKP, you will get a quite specific
email, e.g. with subject:

[krzk:for-next] BUILD SUCCESS 5b248db78d1aa679009efa4763794890572e63fb
[krzk-github:n/of-device-id-of-match-ptr-rebase] BUILD SUCCESS ce0964f4

(where krzk/krzk-github are the names of repos in LKP)


Best regards,
Krzysztof
