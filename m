Uh, I think you're wrong on this one - structs with designated
initializers have unspecified fields initialized to 0, and I would
expect the same to hold for unions, and the language in the C standard
isn't completely explicit but it appears to apply to both.

And checking the generated assembly for a six_set_nospin() that calls a
six_set_bitmask() with the test_bit() taken out, for simplicity

00000000000002c0 <six_set_nospin>:
 2c0:	e8 00 00 00 00       	call   2c5 <six_set_nospin+0x5>
 2c5:	55                   	push   %rbp
 2c6:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
 2c9:	f0 80 4f 03 80       	lock orb $0x80,0x3(%rdi)
 2ce:	5d                   	pop    %rbp
 2cf:	c3                   	ret

meaning the compiler properly constant-propagated and didn't read
uninitialized memory. And I did the same test in userspace too, in the
unlikely event -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero was affecting things.

Because of aliasing issues? I thought it had been declared that the
kernel would never do strict aliasing.

...but, atomic_or() is clearly the right way to do this :)
