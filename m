Are you sure this is the case? Leaving the root port in D0 would mean
its power resource is left on and that would leave the whole USB4 domain
on consuming quite a lot of power. The root ports involved are supposed
to support PME from the D3hot/cold (this is what they advertise in their
config spaces) which should allow the OS to move the port into low power
states. Of course the PME from D3cold in general needs some ACPI support
(typically a GPE) in the BIOS.

Can't we then check here AMD case instead? Then generic case would be to
support according what the port announces.
