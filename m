Isn't vhost_init_device_iotlb() racy then, as d->iotlb is first updated with niotlb and later d->vqs[i]->iotlb is updated with niotlb. What does garantee this is done atomically?

Shouldn't we hold the dev->mutex to make all the sequence atomic and
include vhost_clear_msg()?Â  Can't the vhost_clear_msg() take the dev lock?

Thanks
