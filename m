That's what the suggestion I got from Qcom PCIe team. But I didn't compare the
value you added during icc support patch with downstream. More below...

Hmm, then I should've asked you this question when you added icc support.
I thought you inherited those values from downstream but apparently not.
Even in downstream they are using different bw votes for different platforms.
I will touch base with PCIe and ICC teams to find out the actual value that
needs to be used.

Regarding 0 icc vote, downstream puts all the devices in D3Cold (poweroff)
state during suspend. So for them 0 icc vote will work but not for us as we need
to keep the device and link intact.
