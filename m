Is it because L1 is a VM migrated from Intel platform to AMD's?

So w/o commit adc2a23734ac ("KVM: nSVM: improve SYSENTER emulation on AMD"):
1> L1 could be a "GenuineIntel" with SVM capability (bizarre as it is), running
in 64-bit mode.
2> With no interception of MSR writes to the SYSENTER_EIP/ESP, L1 may set its
SYSENTER_EIP/ESP to a 64-bit value successfully (though sysenter/sysexit may
fail).
3> L2 could be in 32-bit mode. And if virtual vmload/vmsave is enabled for L1,
only lower 32 bits of those MSRs will be loaded, leaking the higher 32 bits.

Is above scenario the reason of Maxim's fix?

But why it is related to nested migration?
