Are you sure? I'm proposing to add a stub which is no-op, but with a comment
inside explaining why. In such case we:

1) shut the kobject infra up;
2) keep the status quo in LSM;
3) put in the code a good explanation for others on what's going on.

I'm not talking about this patchset, but you are right that it wasn't
tested.

And continuing to spread the noise in the logs just because LSM is stubborn?

Note, I'm full for the proper fix, but the current issue is logs flooding done
by LSM that needs to be addressed.
