How is AWS nitro relevant to our discussion about adding sysfs file to Linux?
Can you please point us to the source code of that hypervisor? Does it even
run on Linux?

Anyway, I'm aware of big cloud providers who are pretty happy with live
migration in production.

Addition of VFs is serial operation, you can fire your VMs once you
counted 100 VFs in sysfs directory.
