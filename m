Wrap changelogs at ~75 chars.  It's ok to go over for things like stack traces
and Fixes:, where the format of the text is more important than the line length.
But for "just words", stay under 75 chars.

Try to avoid pronouns as they are often ambiguous, and even when they're not, using
pronouns can sometimes require more effort from the readers, e.g. might require the
reader to "jump back" in the sentence to understand what "it" means.

And for cases like this, RAX is one more char, so just type RAX.

This is "working as intended".  When someone gives a conditional Reviewed-by,
the intent is very much that _if_ you make the requested changes in good faith,
then their review will be carried.  In other words, not adding Jim's review
would be "wrong" from a certain perspective.

Heh, the fact that you felt compelled to write this is a very, very good indication
that this should be two patches.

The bug Vitaly encountered is exactly why it's pre

Pushed both (as three patches) to branch `for_paolo/6.1` at:

I shortened this one too, 94 chars is a bit much :-)

  KVM: selftests: Don't set reserved bits for invalid Hyper-V hypercall number
