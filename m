the boolean information contained in taints is not helpful, stuff like
audit logs / crash dumps / bpftool reports are much more helpful.

Again no worries, but we need to make sure that the taint flag is not
abused, and if it is being abused, limit the damage somewhere.

We should definitely carefully review any new ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION
functions, that's the real value add.

We aim to be blameless and constructive :)
