Andrew, how long will you remain in "wait-a-few-days-mode"? Given what
Greg said below and that we already had three reports I know of I'd
prefer if we could fix this rather sooner than later in mainline --
especially as Arch Linux and openSUSE Tumbleweed likely have switched to
6.4.y already or will do so soon.
