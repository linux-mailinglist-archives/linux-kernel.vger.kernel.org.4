Thank you for the review!

We are working on a v2 addressing your comments.

Just one small detail regarding these comments: I hope you don't mind if
we use "MPTCP socket" instead of "main MPTCP socket". Per connection,
there is one MPTCP socket and possibly multiple subflow (TCP) sockets.
There is then no concept of "main MPTCP socket".

It makes sense, we understand. These two patches were ready for a bit of
time but we wanted to send them only after the prerequisite commits
applied in net-next first. But that got delayed because we had a couple
of nasty issues with them :)

We hope it will not be an issue for you to maintain them in your tree
for a couple of months but we tried to minimised the modifications in
MPTCP code. Do not hesitate to reach us if there are some issues with them!

Cheers,
Matt
