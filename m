Yes, that is the elephant in the room - deleting the memslot makes all of the sense,
and I thought about doing it, except that it has a chance of letting 
the genie out of its bottle again - remember that mess we had with the fact that
the memslots are rcu protected?
 
If it works, I 100% support the idea.
 
Also I think you want to remove the KVM_REQ_UNBLOCK, in the other patch series
you just posted?
