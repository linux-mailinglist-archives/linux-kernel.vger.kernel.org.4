I meant functions that are noreturn intrinsically.  The trivial example:

void f(void)
{
	for (;;)
		;
}

Many "potentially does not return" functions (there are very many such
functions!) turn into "never returns" functions, for some inputs (or
something in the environment).  If the compiler specialises a code path
that does not return, you'll not see that marked up any way.  Of course
such a path should not be taken in the kernel, normally :-)

The trap handler can see where the trap came from.  And then look up
that address in some tables or such.  Just like __bug_table?
