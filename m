Sure it works by some definition of "works" because obviously that
implementation does not care about where a particular message originates
from.

But that's still wrong at the conceptual level because it very much
matters where a message originates from. PCIe devices and general
platform devices have very distinct mechanisms to transport that
information.

Just because it "works" does not prove that it is correct.

How are you going to do proper shielding with that approach?

And therefore the originating device is irrelevant, right? Get to the
point where you have ITS and it all falls apart.

I did not claim that _you_ said that. _I_ said that this is wrong. See
above.

Again, you are explaining what your implementation is doing, but you are
not describing the conceptual level.

I'm very well aware of the fact that a PCI endpoint does not have the
standard MSI configuration space mechanism.

>  That's reason why need "platform msi", or you called "global"

Again: platform MSI does not convey the PCIe device originator. It might
be irrelevant for your actual platform, but that does not make it more
correct. Once you have the need to track the origin of a MSI message
then the distinction between platform and MSI matters.

Sure you can argue that you don't care, but that does neither make it
correct nor future proof and there is no point to rework this whole
thing 6 month down the road when you actually have to support GIC-ITS.

As I explained to you before: The concept of MSI controller does not
exist in the kernel. It might exist in your NXP nomenclature, but that's
irrelevant here.

> Your patches focus on the msi controller itself. 

No. They focus on changing the hierarchy model from "global" MSI domains
to per device MSI domains so that the weird constructs of platform MSI
can be replaced by something which actually matches the hardware and
provides a proper abstraction for PCIe/NTB at the right level.

Sure, but at:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/devel.git devmsi-v2-arm

platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs() does not exist anymore.

You replied to exactly that series which builds on top of devmsi-v2-part3, no?

So what are you trying to tell me?

Thanks,
