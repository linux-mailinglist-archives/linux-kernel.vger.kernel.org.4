Works for me.

ctor/dtor must be implemented in each livepatch. klp_shadow_register()
would need to remember all registered implementations.
klp_shadow_alloc/get/free would need to find and choose one.
It would add an extra overhead and non-determines.

The overhead might be negligible. The callbacks should be compatible.
But still, is it worth the potential troubles?

IMHO, it is just about POV. Does it really matter if we pass id or type?

Switching to type might be a slight complication for existing API users
that are used to ID. But we are changing the API anyway.

I am sorry but I do not understand this concern. The new API hides
ctor/dtor into struct klp_shadow_type. It removes one NULL parameter
from klp_alloc/get/free API. It looks like a simplification to me.

I probably do not understand it correctly.

Normal livepatch developers do not need to use klp_shadow_{un}register().
They are called transparently in __klp_enable_patch()/klp_complete_transition()
and klp_module_coming()/klp_cleanup_module_patches_limited().

The main reason why they are exposed via include/linux/livepatch.h
and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is the selftest lib/livepatch/test_klp_shadow_vars.c.

Well, the selftest probably could be bundled into a livepatch to go
around this.


> - It's internally confusing in klp to have both 'type' and 'type_reg'.

I do not like it much either.

An idea. We could replace "bool registered" with "struct list_head
register_node" in struct klp_shadow_type. Then we could use it
for registration.

All the registered types will be in a global list (klp_type_register).
klp_shadow_unregister() would do the garbage collection when it
removed the last entry with the given id from the global list.

Good point!

They actually are unregisterd via:

  + __klp_enable_patch()
    + klp_cancel_transition()    # err: in __klp_enabled_patch()
      + klp_complete_transition()
	+ klp_unregister_shadow_types()

But there is a problem. It tries to unregister all types.
We have to make sure that it does not complain when a type has
not been registered yet.

Yup. It would be easier also if the use list_head pointing to the
global register.

I guess that there is a misunderstanding. We need two databases:

   + One for the registered shadow_types. I does the reference
     counting. It counts the number of livepatched objects
     (livepatches) that might the shadow type. It says _when_ the garbage
     collection must be done.

   + Second for existing shadow variables. It is needed for finding
     the shadow data. It says _what_ variables have to freed when
     the garbage collection is being proceed.

Yes, it would make more sense.

This probably won't be needed after we get rid of shadow_type_reg.

Also this is actually a valid scenario. klp_complete_transition()
might try to unregister a not-yet-registered type. It might happen
when called from __klp_enabled_patch() error path.

Thanks a lot for the review.
