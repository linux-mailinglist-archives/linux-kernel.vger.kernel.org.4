There is quite a bit of tribal knowledge around proper use of try_module_get()
and requiring *somehow* the module to still exist to use this call in a way
that is safe. Document this bit of tribal knowledge. To be clear, you should
only use try_module_get() *iff* you are 100% sure the module already does
exist and is not on its way out.

You can be sure the module still exists and is alive through:

1) Direct protection with its refcount: you know some earlier caller called
   __module_get() safely
2) Implied protection: there is an implied protection against module removal

Having an idea of when you are sure __module_get() might be called earlier is
easy to understand however the implied protection requires an example. We use
sysfs an an example for implied protection without a direct module reference
count bump. kernfs / sysfs uses its own internal reference counting for files
being actively used, when such file are active they completely prevent
the module from being removed. kernfs protects this with its kernfs_active().
Effort has been put into verifying the kernfs implied protection works by
using a currently out-of-tree test_sysfs selftest test #32 [0]:

./tools/testing/selftests/sysfs/sysfs.sh -t 0032

Without kernfs / sysfs preventing module removal through its active reference
count (kernfs_active()) the write would fail or worse, a crash would happen in
this test and it does not.

Similar safeguards are required for other users of try_module_get() *iff*
they are not ensuring the above rule 1) is followed.

I had actually written an initial version of these docs [0] *two years* ago
through my test_sysfs patches [1]. Back then the only pushback I got to get this
test upstream was Greg's opposition to me using copyleft-next for my test driver.
Upon feedback from the comunity, we've now have passed that hurtle, and we
have proper SPDX tags for copyleft-next driver upstream. Before I follow up
again with that test_sysfs driver though *this* patch in particular seems
important enough to get upstream and so sending this separately because
I see some folks might still be in high need of these docs.

I'll reply to the thread / patch in question next.

+ *    sysfs. The sysfs store / read file operations are guaranteed to exist
+ *    through the use of kernfs's active reference (see kernfs_active()) and a
+ *    sysfs / kernfs file removal cannot happen unless the same file is not
+ *    active. Therefore, if a sysfs file is being read or written to the module
+ *    which created it must still exist. It is therefore safe to use
+ *    try_module_get() on module sysfs store / read ops.
+ *
+ * One of the real values to try_module_get() is the module_is_live() check
