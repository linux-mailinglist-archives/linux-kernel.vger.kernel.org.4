Yes, that's the one.  Part of the BPF "splatter stuff all across the
kernel that we don't really understand" (see, I can be just as
disagreeable!)

Correct; if it's been frozen by this CPU, we'll spin forever.  I think
the other conditions where we retry are temporary and caused by
something _another_ CPU is doing.  For example, if _this_ CPU is in the
middle of modifying the tree when an NMI happens, we won't hit the
xas_retry() case.  That can only happen if we've observed something
another CPU did, and then a second write happened from that same other
CPU.  The easiest example of that would be that we hit this kind of
race:

CPU 0				CPU 1
load root of tree, points to node
				store entry in root of tree
				wmb();
				store RETRY entry in node
load entry from node, observe RETRY entry

The retry will happen and we'll observe the new state of the tree with
the entry we're looking for in the root.

If CPU 1 takes an NMI and interrupts itself, it will always see a
consistent tree.

The Uptodate flag check needs to be done by the caller; the
find_get_page() family return !uptodate pages.

But find_get_page() does not advertise itself as NMI-safe.  And I
think it's wrong to try to make it NMI-safe.  Most of the kernel is
not NMI-safe.  I think it's incumbent on the BPF people to get the
information they need ahead of taking the NMI.  NMI handlers are not
supposed to be doing a huge amount of work!  I don't really understand
why it needs to do work in NMI context; surely it can note the location of
the fault and queue work to be done later (eg on irq-enable, task-switch
or return-to-user)
