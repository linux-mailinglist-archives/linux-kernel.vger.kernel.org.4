Note that every increment of LOCKDEP_CHAINS_BITS double the storage 
space. With 99, that will likely exceed the total amount of memory you 
have in your system.

Boqun, where does the 5 figure come from. It is just a simple u16 array 
of size MAX_LOCKDEP_CHAIN_HLOCKS. The chain_hlocks array stores the lock 
chains that show up in the lockdep splats and in the /proc/lockdep* 
files. Each chain is variable size. As we add new lock into the chain, 
we have to repeatedly deallocate and reallocate a larger chain buffer. 
That will cause fragmentation in the chain_hlocks[]. So if we have a 
very long lock chain, the allocation may fail because the largest free 
block is smaller than the requested chain length. There may be enough 
free space in chain_hlocks, but it is just too fragmented to be useful.

Maybe we should figure out a better way to handle this fragmentation. In 
the mean time, the easiest way forward is just to increase the 
LOCKDEP_CHAINS_BITS by 1.

It is not just the issue of calling the memory allocator. There is also 
the issue of copying data from old chain_hlocks to new one while the old 
one may be updated during the copying process unless we can freeze 
everything else.
