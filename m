Hmm, OK. That is only for the scalability.

Yes, that's right. As far as using a global object pool, there must
be a performance bottleneck to pick up an object and returning the
object to the pool. Per-CPU pool may give a better performance but
more complicated to balance pools. Per-task shadow stack will solve it.
So I plan to expand fgraph API and use it in fprobe instead of rethook.
(I planned to re-implement rethook, but I realized that it has more issue
than I thought.)

Yeah, I understand that. Rethook (and kretprobes) is not designed
for such heavy workload.

OK, I think we are on the same page and same direction.
