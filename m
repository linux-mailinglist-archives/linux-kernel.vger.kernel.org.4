It seems that I didn't describe the issue clearly.
The container doesn't have CAP_SYS_ADMIN, but the CAP_SYS_ADMIN is
required to run bpftool,  so the bpftool running in the container
can't get the ID of bpf objects or convert IDs to FDs.
Is there something that I missed ?

Some questions,
- What if the process exits after attaching the bpf prog and the prog
is not auto-detachable?
  For example, the reuserport bpf prog is not auto-detachable. After
pins the reuserport bpf prog, a task can attach it through the pinned
bpf file, but if the task forgets to detach it and the pinned file is
removed, then it seems there's no way to figure out which task or
cgroup this prog belongs to...
- Could you pls. explain in detail how to get comm, pid, or cgroup
from a pinned bpffs file?
