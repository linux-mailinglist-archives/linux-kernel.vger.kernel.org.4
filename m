I don't thikn you can simply not update on offline, even if
effective_cpus doesn't go empty, because the intersection between
task_cpu_possible_mask() and effective_cpus might have gone empty.

Very fundamentally, the introduction of task_cpu_possible_mask() means
that you now *HAVE* to always consider affinity settings per-task, you
cannot group them anymore.
