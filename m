Um...You can google for more information about the AWS nitro system.

Yes, it's digressive, so let's back to the discussion about adding sysfs 
file.

We're having trouble coming to an agreement on this point, but it does't 
matter. Please see below.

According to the current implementation, the addition of VFs must be in 
order, so this can not properly work.

For example, the VM uses VF200, VF202, VF204, but the sriov_add_vfs can 
only add VFs in the order VF0, VF1, VF2 ... The limitation is introduced 
by the software, not the PCI spec.
