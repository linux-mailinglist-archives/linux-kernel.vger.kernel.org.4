I'm afraid there is no [1], probably got lost while resending :)

Same with [2].

Good enough for now I guess. Reserving it via memblock might be better, 
though.

What would be the main purpose of that option?

Let's be clear: nobody is going to run encrypted VMs "out of the blue".

You can expect a certain hypervisor setup to be required, for example, 
enabling it on the cmdline and then allocating that metadata from 
memblock during boot.

IIRC s390x handles it similarly with protected VMs and required metadata.

What's the primary reason to enhance that? Are there reasonable use 
cases? Why would be expect to have other (!TDX capable) memory in the 
system?
