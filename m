PCI_CONF1_EXT_ADDRESS express indirect register access. If you look at
the address space of Intel PCI Configuration Mechanism #1 then it is
really what this ARM PCIe controller implements (plus uses additional
bits for larger 4kB space). This is really common what lot of non-ECAM
ARM SoC implements. It is really bad to mix this mapping with ECAM.
