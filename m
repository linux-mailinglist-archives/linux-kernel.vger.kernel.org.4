I have looked into reusing is_error_source() and modifying
find_source_device() to also add CXL devices (the RCiEPs) to the dev
list in e_info. The problem I see is that at AER level it is unknown
whether an error happened or not. The downstream port AER capability
also does not reside in a PCI config space header and thus is not
directly bound to a pci_dev. That means the endpoint's AER capability
in pci_dev is not the one we need, instead a CXL aware driver must
lookup the RCRB which contains the AER. Additional, the CXL RAS cap
must be inspected by that driver.

Assuming we add the RCiEP to the dev list the CXL endpoint will be
processed by aer_get_device_error_info(), aer_print_error() and
handle_error_source(). This is done for the endpoint device even if
the source is the dport. Also we need to check the error status of
both caps registers first. This will cause error reports and status
checks of devices not being the error source.

That said, I think the best option is still to delegate the error down
to a CXL handler and do the error status check, reporting and handling
of the CXL specifics there.

I see your point that esp. the pci_dev's refcount handling needs to be
improved. I will address that along with the other review comments in
a next version of this patch series. Let's then revisit this
discussion here?

Thanks,

-Robert
