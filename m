I may miss something but I don't see any problem with vDPA core.

It's the duty of the parents to advertise the features it has. For example,

1) If some kernel version that is packed is not supported via
set_vq_state, parents should not advertise PACKED features in this
case.
2) If the kernel has support packed set_vq_state(), but it's emulated
cvq doesn't support, parents should not advertise PACKED as well

If a parent violates the above 2, it looks like a bug of the parents.
