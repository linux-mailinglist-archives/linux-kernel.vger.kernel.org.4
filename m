Actually let's be clearer - your cover letter says:
"In some systems the link is not brought up
during probe, but later in the context of an end-point turning on. (...)
to skip this loop."

so this is pure Linux OS stuff. You just want to control driver behavior
from DT. Not at all DT property.

Krzysztof
