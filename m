I'd even forgotten about the sparse mmap solution here, that's even
better than trying to do something clever with the mmap.

Existing QEMU has an assert in pci_register_bar() that the size of the
MemoryRegion must be a power of 2, therefore it is ABI that the a vfio
PCI BAR region must be a power of 2.  It's not sufficient to change
QEMU, an old QEMU running on a kernel with this device would assert.
The BAR region must either be properly sized or we define a new region
definition which requires new QEMU support to mimic a BAR, but I don't
know why we wouldn't just use this sparse mmap trick.

Juan and I discussed this with Ankit last week, there are a lot of down
sides with another machine type, but the automatic manipulation of the
machine is still problematic.  Another option we have is to use QEMU
command line options for each feature.  For example we already support
NUMA VM configurations and loading command line ACPI tables, hopefully
also associating devices to nodes.  Do we end up with just a
configuration spec for the VM to satisfy the in-guest drivers?
Potentially guest driver requirements may changes over time, so a hard
coded recipe built-in to QEMU might not be the best solution anyway.

I think we need to be careful about how and where we apply it.  Yes,
there could be a guest OS that caches the capabilities of the root
ports and could have stale information at the time the driver probes
Atomic Ops information.  But the spec doesn't prohibit RO defined bits
from changing that I can find... and I can't come up with a better
solution to support atomic ops.

The alternative would again be device switches on the QEMU command
line, which I think would have a dependency on disabling hotplug for
the slot (pcie-root-port,hotplug=off) and also need to validate that
all virtual downstream devices capable of those atomic ops have
equivalent host support.  I couldn't find enough downsides to the risk
that a guest booted with an Atomic Ops capable device that also caches
the capabilities of the root port (Linux doesn't) might hot-unplug that
device, hot-plug a new device w/o the same host support (ex. different
slot or different host after a migration), and report the stale atomic
ops support.

I think NVIDIA might have an interest in enabling Atomic Ops support in
VMs as well, so please comment in the series thread if there are
concerns here or if anyone can definitively says that another guest OS
we might care about does cache root port capability bits.  Thanks,

Alex
