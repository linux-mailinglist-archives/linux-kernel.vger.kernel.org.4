Fully agree! That's why I said, this change makes no sense from a memory
usage point of view. The overall memory savings are not visible at all,
recognizing that the slab allocator isn't able to put more vCPU objects
in a given slab page. However, I still remain confident that this makes
sense from a uarch point of view. Touching less cache lines should be a
win -- even if I'm unable to measure it. By preserving more cachelines
during a VMEXIT, guests should be able to resume their work faster
(assuming they still need these cachelines).

Any pointers to measure the "more performant" aspect? I tried to make
use of the vmx_vmcs_shadow_test in kvm-unit-tests, as it's already
counting cycles, but the numbers are too unstable, even if I pin the
test to a given CPU, disable turbo mode, SMT, use the performance cpu
governor, etc.

Yeah, was exactly thinking the same when modifying kvm_pmu.

Heh, just found this gem in vcpu_vmx:

struct vcpu_vmx {
  [...]
  union vmx_exit_reason      exit_reason;

  /* XXX 44 bytes hole, try to pack */

  /* --- cacheline 123 boundary (7872 bytes) --- */
  struct pi_desc             pi_desc __attribute__((__aligned__(64)));
  [...]

So there are, in fact, some bigger holes left.

Would be nice if pahole had a --density flag that would output some
ASCII art, visualizing which bytes of a struct are allocated by real
members and which ones are pure padding.
