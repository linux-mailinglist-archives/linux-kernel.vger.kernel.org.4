Thanks.  It will also be useful to comment the uapi's bpf.h and mention
prog_attach_flags should not be set during effective_query.

No.  I don't think the zero attr->query.attach_flags can be enforced 
now.  It is used as an output value only and its input value has never 
been checked.  Although the bpftool always sets it to 0 before the 
query, checking zero now does not gain much while there is a slight 
chance of breaking other users.

Only need to set/output uattr->query.attach_flags as 0 during 
effective_query.

I would not change the uapi for this.  0 implicitly means no flags or 
none.  Regardless, this change does not belong to the bpf tree where 
this fix will be landing.
