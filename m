What do you mean here by "PL330 integrated with a peripheral"?

Devicetree is for describing hardware, not the contents of registers of
a device. Your changes might fit or might not, I don't know this good
enough, so I wait for your justification. Without justification this
looks like controlling driver from DT...

Don't add discoverable stuff to DT.

I could not find here a case describing hardware. You pointed out some
code. What does the code have anything to do with DT?
