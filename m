The way to deal with this is to merge DRTM support (when it's ready of
course) so people have an option which isn't tboot.

Then warn on finding a TPM2 without SHA-2, and make it a failure for
https://fwupd.github.io/libfwupdplugin/hsi.html#tpm-20-present etc, and
eventually the vendors will decide that the easiest way to avoid getting
a cross in their customers UIs is to implement SHA-2 support properly.
