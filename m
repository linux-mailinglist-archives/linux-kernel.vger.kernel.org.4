Good point, I'll check this confused deputy attack. Extended KVM 
protections should indeed handle all ways to map guests' memory. I'm 
wondering if current VMMs would gracefully handle such new restrictions 
though.

For now, in the static kernel case, all rodata and text GPA is 
restricted, so aliasing such memory in a writable way before or after 
the KVM enforcement would still restrict write access to this memory, 
which could be an issue but not a security one. Do you have such 
examples in mind?

This would indeed be required to properly handle the dynamic cases.

Good idea. For "super locked down kernels" :) , we should disable all 
kernel executable changes with the related kernel build configuration 
(e.g. eBPF JIT, kernel module, kprobes…) to make sure there is no such 
legitimate access. This looks like an acceptable initial feature.

This is our goal. I think both static and dynamic cases are legitimate 
and have value according to the level of security sought. This should be 
a build-time configuration.
