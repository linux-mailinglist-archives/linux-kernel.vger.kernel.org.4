Here, we do not need to backup 'error_fs', as 
'EXT4_SB(sb)->s_mount_state' already
record this flag when fs has error flag before do journal replay.

My modification is to deal with the situation we missed, and I don't 
want to introduce
an invalid super block submission.
If you think my judgment is too obscure, I can send another version 
according to your
suggestion.

After jbd2_journal_load() 'es->s_state' is already covered by the super 
block in journal.
If there is super block in journal and 'es->s_state' has error flag this 
means super block
in journal has error flag. If there is no super block in journal and  
'es->s_state' has error
flag, this means super block already has error flag.In both cases we can 
do nothing.
