I agree.

I don't think it should return "true" when the PF is present and VFS
are disabled.

I think pci_device_is_present(VF) should return "true" if the PF is
present and VFs are enabled.
In the current implementation, it cannot correctly judge whether the
VF is present.
When the PF is present and VFs are enabled, I think it should return
"true", but in fact it returns "false"

Through your comments, I realize that this patch is inaccurate in
judging whether VF present in the case of "the PF is present and 
VFs are disabled"

Thinks,
Wei
