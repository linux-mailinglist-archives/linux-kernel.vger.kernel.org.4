There are two things, _SxW and _SxD, and they shouldn't be confused.

_SxW tells you what the deepest power state from which wakeup can be
signaled by the device (in the given Sx state of the system) is.

_SxD tells you what the deepest power state supported by the device
(in the given Sx state of the system) is.

And note that _SxW is applicable to the device itself, not the
subordinate devices, so I'm not sure how meaningful it is for ports.

pci_target_state() uses both _SxW and _SxD to determine the deepest
state the device can go into and so long as it is used properly, it
shouldn't return a power state that is too deep, so I'm not really
sure why you want this special "should the bridge be allowed to go
into D3hot/cold" routine to double check this.

Which is suspend-to-idle AFAICS, so from the ACPI perspective it is
all S0 anyway.

Generally speaking, pci_bridge_d3_possible() is there to prevent
bridges (and PCIe ports in particular) from being put into D3hot/cold
if there are reasons to believe that it may not work.
acpi_pci_bridge_d3() is part of that.

Even if it returns 'true', the _SxD/_SxW check should still be applied
via pci_target_state() to determine whether or not the firmware allows
this particular bridge to go into D3hot/cold.  So arguably, the _SxW
check in acpi_pci_bridge_d3() should not be necessary and if it makes
any functional difference, there is a bug somewhere else.
