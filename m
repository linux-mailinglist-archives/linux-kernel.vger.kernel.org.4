> - For patch 27, added Co-developed-by tag for Jianlong and me. Renamed
>   cpu labels to "S76_0", "U74_*" instead of "cpu*" following the style
>   of jh7100.dtsi. Moved all "clock-frequency" properties to the board dts.
>   Rewrote clock-controller nodes and deleted reset-controller nodes for
>   using auxiliary bus. Rewrote gpio nodes following generic pinctrl
>   bindings. Removed the redundant second reset entry of uart nodes.
> - For patch 28, added Co-developed-by tag for Jianlong and me. Added a
>   chosen node. Removed reserved-memory node. Added fixed frequency clock
>   nodes for overriding the "clock-frequency" properties. Rewrote the gpio
>   nodes following generic pinctrl bindings.
> - Dropped patch 30. (by Conor)
> - Reworded the commit messages.
