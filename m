If we get assured that hardware with such problem exists (if you'll get
confirmation about the supposition 3. above) then we'll need to
activate your trick for that hardware only. Adding dummy reads for all
the remote eDMA setups doesn't look correct since it adds additional
delay to the execution path and especially seeing nobody has noticed
and reported such problem so far (for instance Gustavo didn't see the
problem on his device otherwise he would have fixed it).

So if assumption 3. is correct then I'd suggest the next
implementation: add a new dw_edma_chip_flags flag defined (a.k.a
DW_EDMA_SLOW_MEM), have it specified via the dw_edma_chip.flags field
in the Akida device probe() method and activate your trick only if
that flag is set.
