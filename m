OK and if so, just set global module parameter "enable_pmu=false" for HYBRID_CPU.
With "disable vPMU" diff, this patch should be dropped since 
kvm_pmu_cap.pebs_ept = 0.

So for HYBRID_CPU, {pebs, lbr, basic PMU} would be disabled globally by KVM
until a dedicated effort enables them one by one in the near future.
