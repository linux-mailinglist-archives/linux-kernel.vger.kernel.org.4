Hi,
It is a PCIe card, so it runs on any platform that supports PCIe cards. 
We do use the HW on x86_64 and arm platforms.

The parameters are in no way connected to the platform where the card is 
used, they are properties of the video signal that can change arbitrary 
as you can connect different car infotainments (the signal source) to 
the card (the same applies to the outputs - the car displays). Usually, 
there is no auto-configuration on the signal level, that's why you have 
to provide the various properties externally according to the 
infotainment that you have at the moment connected to the card.

Any kind of device tree or ACPI parameters make no sense for the HW/the 
intended usage.

M.
