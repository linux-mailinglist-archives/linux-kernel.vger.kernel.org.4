Will try to cleanup my patches and send an RFC next week. Need to rebase,
cleanup etc. Not sure I can make it soon as I am busy with other things for 6.5
right now.

You can have a look at the work in progress here:

https://github.com/damien-lemoal/linux/tree/rockpro64_ep_v21

There are a bunch of epf and epc core patches as well as some rockchip driver
patches. The first half of the patches on top of Linus 6.3 tag patch are already
in pci-next.
