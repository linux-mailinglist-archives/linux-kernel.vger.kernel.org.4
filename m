This series comprises two related fixes:

- the FILL_RETURN_BUFFER macro in -next needs to access percpu data,
  hence the GS segment base needs to be loaded before FILL_RETURN_BUFFER.
  This means moving guest vmload/vmsave and host vmload to assembly
  (patches 4 and 6).

- because AMD wants the OS to set STIBP to 1 before executing the
  return thunk (un)training sequence, IA32_SPEC_CTRL must be restored
  before UNTRAIN_RET, too.  This must also be moved to assembly and,
  for consistency, the guest SPEC_CTRL is also loaded in there
  (patch 7).

Neither is particularly hard, however because of 32-bit systems one needs
to keep the number of arguments to __svm_vcpu_run to three or fewer.
One is taken for whether IA32_SPEC_CTRL is intercepted, and one for the
host save area, so all accesses to the vcpu_svm struct have to be done
from assembly too.  This is done in patches 2, 3 and 5 and it turns out
not to be that bad; in fact I don't think the code is much harder to
follow than before despite doing a lot more stuff.  Care has been taken
to keep the "normal" and SEV-ES code as similar as possible, too.

The above summary leaves out the more mundane patches 1 and 8.  They
are respectively preparation for adding more asm-offsets, and dead
code removal.  Most of the scary diffstat comes from patch 1, which is
purely moving inline functions to a separate header file than svm.h.

Peter Zijlstra had already sent a similar patch for the first issue last
Friday.  Unfortunately it did not take care of the 32-bit issue with the
number of arguments.  This series is independent of his, but I did steal
his organization of the exception fixup code because it's pretty.

Tested on 64-bit bare metal including SEV-ES, and on 32-bit nested.  On
top of this I also spent way too much time comparing the output of
the compiler code before the patch with the assembly code after.
