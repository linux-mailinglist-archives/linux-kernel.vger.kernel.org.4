I think so, too.

AFAICT there's nothing that prevents __modify_ftrace_direct() and
call_direct_funcs() from concurrently accessing ftrace_ops::direct_call, so we
need READ_ONCE() in call_direct_funcs() to prevent load tearing and other
issues mentioned in the article linked above.

The existing code has a similar pattern where __modify_ftrace_direct() and
ftrace_find_rec_direct() access ftrace_func_entry::direct concurrently. Do we
want a preparatory patch fixing that for stable?

Thanks,
Mark.
