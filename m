For starters, SCHED_CORE doesn't use __pick_next_task() (much). But I
think you're going to have more trouble with prio_less() (which is the
3rd implementation of the scheduling function :/)

That is a horrible situation as is, FIFO/RR are very crap scheduling
policies for a number of reasons but we're stuck with them due to
history and POSIX :-(, that is not something you should justify anything
with.

In fact, it should be an example of what to avoid.

Specifically, FIFO/RR fail at the fundamentals of OS
abstractions -- they provide neither resource distribution nor
isolation.

That all sounds quite terrible.. :/

When the scheduler isn't available it should be an error to switch a
task to the policy, when there are tasks in the policy, it must not go
away.

The policy itself should never cause policy changes.
