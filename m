Hi,

With the BSS "fix" in grub for fedora/rhel, this is now working fine for 
both systemd-boot and normal grub2, as well as booting directly from the 
UEFI shell. Given both the magic number and the bss fix were merged at 
the same time I don't think anyone should ever see the bad bss message, 
at least not on the above distro's.

I've largely been testing this on the PFTF/RPi4, and in a libvirt 
qemu/kvm env with/without ksan/etc on a mostly fedora configured kernel. 
Hooking this up to kinstall makes sense and works, although i'm not a 
big fan.

So, its looking good. All thumbs up here :)
