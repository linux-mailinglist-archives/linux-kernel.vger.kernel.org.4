That's not so much an argument against allowing the PCIe controller
driver to be unbound as it is an argument for preventing endpoint
drivers from being unbound.

And they generally need to be able to unbind due to hotplugging, right?

Having modular drivers that can be unloaded is a debugging feature. I
believe I already posted this quote from Linus:

	The proper thing to do (and what we _have_ done) is to say
	"unloading of modules is not supported". It's a debugging
	feature, and you literally shouldn't do it unless you are
	actively developing that module.

	https://lore.kernel.org/all/Pine.LNX.4.58.0401251054340.18932@home.osdl.org/

And no, keeping such patches out-of-tree is not an option as it prevents
sharing them with others and they will quickly bit rot.

If we have buggy endpoint drivers we need fix them regardless. Allowing
this fundamental debugging feature will even allow developers to catch
those bugs sooner.

And this is really no different from any other type of bug in endpoint
drivers; a failure to deregister a class device on unbind would lead to
crashes due to use-after-free, etc.
