Yes, I have updated the description from the v3 version.

So if we don't compress the symbol type, we can first compress the
searched symbol and then make a quick comparison based on the compressed
length and content. In this way, for entries with mismatched lengths,
there is no need to expand and compare strings. And for those matching
lengths, there's no need to expand the symbol. This saves a lot of time.

Good catch. I should remove "so that it gets compressed together"

They do not depend on this change, because the index in
insert_real_symbols_in_table() is still starting from 0. kallsyms_expand_symbol()
shows that it uses every byte of the compressed data to look up the token table.
The index in insert_real_symbols_in_table() starting from 0 make sure that the
raw character of 'type' occupies a separate position in kallsyms_token_table[].
So that kallsyms_expand_symbol() can still work well.

Yes, see kallsyms() in scripts/link-vmlinux.sh
	if is_enabled CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL; then
                kallsymopt="${kallsymopt} --all-symbols"
        fi

Should they call the API directly?

Yesï¼ŒI've also considered this, for the purpose of increasing the
compression ratio. See below, if the sorting is performed based on
the address and then based on the type. We can record all the symbol
type information in less than 100 bytes. Of course, this makes the
functions that look up symbols based on the address loop serveral
times more. However, I would like to wait until the current patch
series is accepted. Otherwise, I'll have to rework a lot of patches
and it's too much work. To be honest, I've been coding for it these days.

cat /proc/kallsyms | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r
  44678 r
  38299 t
  28315 T
  11644 d
   3768 D
   2778 b
    778 R
    641 B
    282 A
    178 W
     37 V

Yes, to make the code look better, I've stopped binding CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL since v3.

3. The symbol type is not compressed regardless of whether
   CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL is set or not. The memory overhead is increased
   by less than 20KiB if CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=n.
