I'm not following. How is a BPF program not kernel development?

Sorry, but again, I'm not following your point. What exactly about this
"fundamentally contradicts" with CO-RE? Please elaborate if you're going
to claim that something is a fundamental contradiction.

I don't know what you mean by "respecting CO-RE". You can compile a BPF
program that calls a kfunc and invoke it on differents, as long as
whatever kernel you're running on provides that kfunc with the same BTF
encoding. This is no different than e.g. accessing a struct element on
two kernel versions.

Also, CO-RE doesn't provide any ironclad guarantees either. If you
access a struct element in a BPF program, and then a kernel version
removes that element from the struct, that BPF program will fail to load
on that kernel.

Agreed, we should improve the QA to mention that you can load kfuncs
from a module -- thanks for pointing that out!
