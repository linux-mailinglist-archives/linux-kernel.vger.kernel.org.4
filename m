Just 2 considerations:
-
When using the schedutil governor, frequencies should be updated with
a period of cppc_cpufreq_get_transition_delay_us().
This period should be 1ms if CPPC doesn't rely on PCC channels, otherwise
the value depends on the PCC channel (cf. cppc_get_transition_latency()).

If the evaluation duration for the perf/ref counters is higher than this
period, I think this would mean that multiple frequency update would happen
while trying to evaluate the current frequency of a CPU.

-
There is a TimeWindowRegister field in CPPC (cf. enum cppc_regs::TIME_WINDOW
and ACPI 6.5 s8.4.6.1.2.5 "Time Window Register") that should approximately
match what this patch aims to solve.
"""
When Autonomous Selection is enabled, values written to the Time Window Register are ignored. Reads of the Time
Window register indicate minimum length of time (in ms) between successive reads of the platformâ€™s performance
counters.
"""
The only issue being that we should be in the case where Autonomous Selection
is disabled, where the description of the register is different.

Pierre
