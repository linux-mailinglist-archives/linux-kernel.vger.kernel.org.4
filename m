We should probably add an entire docs page which describes how kptrs
work, and I am happy to do that (ideally in a follow-on patch set if
that's OK with you). In general I think it would be useful to include
docs for any general-purpose kfuncs like the ones proposed in this set.

In regards to your specific question about the task lifecycle, nothing
being proposed in this patch set differs from how kptr lifecycles work
in general. The idea is that the BPF program:

1. Gets a "kptr_ref" kptr from an "acquire" kfunc.
2. Stores it in a map with bpf_kptr_xchg().

The program can then either later manually extract it from the map
(again with bpf_kptr_xchg()) and release it, or if the reference is
never removed from the map, let it be automatically released when the
map is destroyed. See [0] and [1] for a bit more information.

I don't think we need to worry about leaks. The verifier should fail to
load any program that doesn't properly release a kptr, and if it fails
to identify programs that improperly hold refcounts, that's a bug that
needs to be fixed. Similarly, if any map implementation (described
below) fails to properly free references at the appropriate time (when
an element or the map itself is destroyed), those are just bugs that
need to be fixed.

I think the relevant tradeoff here is really the possible side effects
of keeping a task pinned and avoiding it being reaped. I agree that's an
important consideration, but I think that would arguably apply to any
kptr (modulo the size of the object being pinned, which is certainly
relevant as well). We already have kptrs for e.g. struct nf_conn [2].
Granted, struct task_struct is significantly larger, but bpf_kptr_xchg()
is only enabled for privileged programs, so it seems like a reasonable
operation to allow.

Someone else can chime in here to correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIU
this is handled by the map implementations calling out to
bpf_obj_free_fields() to invoke the kptr destructor when the element is
destroyed. See [3] and [4] for examples of where they're called from the
arraymap and hashmap logic respectively. This is how the destructors are
similarly invoked when the maps are destroyed.
