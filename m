It's perfectly fine for the IP to support PCI features that are not
and can not be enabled in a system design.  But I expect that
strapping or firmware would disable those features so they are not
advertised in config space.

If BIOS leaves features disabled because they cannot work, but at the
same time leaves them advertised in config space, I'd say that's a
BIOS defect.  In that case, we should have a DMI quirk or something to
work around the defect.

I think limiting ASPM support to whatever BIOS configured at boot-time
is problematic.  I don't think we can assume that all platforms have
firmware that configures ASPM as aggressively as possible, and
obviously firmware won't configure hot-added devices at all (in
general; I know ACPI _HPX can do some of that).

It's possible we need some kind of policy that limits ASPM to the BIOS
config until date X, but I don't want to limit that forever.

I'm not sure I follow this, but it sounds like you're saying PTM
doesn't work correctly with some ASPM configurations.  Is this allowed
by the PCIe spec or is it a hardware defect?  If the latter, maybe we
just need a quirk to disable PTM on the device.

I'm not sure PTM is valuable enough to add a generic callback
mechanism to work around a defect in an individual device.
