You didn't get my point. The consumer wants to know if the 3 bytes is supported
or not, that's should be part of the DMA related thing, right?

It's incorrectly to say 4 for 3 if the backend DMA controller behaves differently
on this. How do you know that (any) DMA controller integrated with this hardware
has no side effects for this change.

So, I don't think the case 3 is correct in this patch.
