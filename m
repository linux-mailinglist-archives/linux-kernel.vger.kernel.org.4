No, it never happens, I just notice it because it'll be weird if I
place the comment where bfq_weights_tree_remove() is called, since bfqq
will still be accessed.

If the suituation that the comment says is possible, perhaps we should
move bfq_weights_tree_remove() to the last of bfq_completed_request().
However, it seems that we haven't meet the problem for quite a long
time...
