Hi Krzysztof,

By integration with peripheral I mean when the PL330 DMA is used to
copy data to/from memory to a peripheral hardware (e.g. FIFO of a SPI
master) where flow control of data is managed by the peripheral
request interface exposed by PL330 :

heral-request-interface

Yes this does control the driver behaviour on how the PL330 DMA
hardware is programmed but it also is a function of
   - The bus width available in the soc towards memory and peripheral
to be different.
   - The requirement of peripherals interfaced with PL330 on how odd
transfer sizes are to be copied from memory to peripheral.

But, both changes IMO can be enabled by default as well in the driver
without devicetree knobs but it carries the risk of regression on
SOC's which do not have such a requirement.

Hence I was looking for some insight from Vinod Koul to see if it is
okay to go ahead with the changes without device tree knobs.

Sure, will not add this to DT.

The instructions mentioned here are consumed by the PL330 Hardware to
generate AXI transactions on the system bus. The example mentioned in
the link is similar to how the driver would behave when this is
enabled.

I shall remove this as well and create a new patch without any DT
depency for the changes.
