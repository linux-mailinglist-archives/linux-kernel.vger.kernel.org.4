Exactly.

Yes.

Yes.

You are right. All this started when I discussed problems with writing
livepatch callbacks with Nicolai. I tried to make it easier by
introducing the klp_state API. But Nicolai realized that it was
still too hard.

The garbage collection was an idea how to easily handle the most
common case, see below.

Yes, we discussed various possibilities and it was always getting pretty
complex.

The most promising direction with the callbacks was connecting
the callbacks with the klp_state. They are versioned as you
suggest above. And we could have callbacks:

    + state_prepare    (instead of pre_patch)
    + state_enable     (instead of post_patch)
    + state_disable    (instead of pre_unpatch)
    + state_cleanup    (instead of pre_unpatch)

The above callbacks would be called only when the state is new.
We might need more callbacks if the support update/downgrade to
another version of the state:

    + state_update_prepare       (instead of pre_patch)
    + state_update_enable        (instead of post_patch)
    + state_downgrade_prepare    (instead of pre_unpatch)
    + state_downgrade_cleanup    (instead of pre_unpatch)

Also we might some callbacks when an action is needed to take
over the state from the previous livepatch:

    + state_take_over_prepare       (instead of pre_patch and pre_unpatch?)
    + state_take_over_enable        (instead of post_patch and post_unpatch?)

IMHO, it is better than the current state. It better describes
the complexity of the problem. It forces/allows livepatch authors
to handle all scenarios correctly.

Anyway, it is complex. The authors have to understand when exactly
each callback will be called. Also some callbacks might be called
from the old-to-be-replaced and some from the new-to-be-used livepatch.

We discussed various use-cases and realized that shadow variables
were very common use case. I have just double checked it and
it seems that we used:

   + post_patch callback for two CVEs
   + klp_shadow_free() for 14 CVEs

This is where the idea of the garbage collection came from. It looked
like an elegant solution for the most common use case. So that
livepatch authors do not need to think about the rather complex
ordering of the many callbacks. They would just register/define
the shadow variable type and be done.

Well, the single state_cleanup() callback would usually be
enough for the shadow variables.


Conclusion:

You are right that the shadow variables and callbacks
are connected. Or more precisely, the shadow variables and
klp_states have similar life-time handling. They both
are introduced/transfered/removed.

Maybe, we could merge klp_shadow and klp_state into a single
entity that would support versioning and various callbacks.

I am just not sure how the entity would be called.
The name is important because it should be clear what it
means and how it can be used. The unification and bad name
might cause more harm then good.

Note that the meaning is a bit different. klp_shadow is
for storing data. klp_state rather describes a change
of the behavior done by a callback.

IMHO, there does not exist 1:1 relation between shadow
variables and states. Using a particular shadow variable
type might define a system state. But a callback might
change a system state even without using shadow variables.

Another small problem is that klp_state is currently in
struct klp_livepatch. And it would be more safe to register
klp_shadow_type in struct klp_object.
