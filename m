Once a patch is applied, it's a commit, not a patch. Just start by
"Switch ...".

Please also define what is the legacy API exactly, and what sort of
API it is switched to with a bit more detail. I don't follow GPIO.

Who noted what? Please provide a reference. I do not connect this
sentence to anything, as I do not follow gpio's mailing list.
