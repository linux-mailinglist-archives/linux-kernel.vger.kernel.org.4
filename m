I'm not familiar with "high end open standards based on ethernet", would
those be some RDMA / storage things? For TCP/IP networks pretty much
the only things that matter in a switch are bandwidth, size of buffers,
power... Implementation stuff.

A lot of "standardization" efforts are just attempts to prove to 
a buyers that an ecosystem exists.

Open source the firmware. Let people actually hack on it and when
the users bring their own algorithms de facto standardization will
happen. Short of that it's all smoke and mirrors.
