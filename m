It looks like >= 2015 (not >2015).  I think "a flag" refers to
"bridge_d3".

No point in citing an old version, so please cite ACPI r6.5, sec 7.3.

The spec claims we only need one object from the table for a device to
be "power-managed", but in reality, it looks like the only things that
actually *control* power are _PRx (the _ON/_OFF methods of Power
Resources) and _PSx (ironically only mentioned parenthically).

This matches up well with acpi_pci_power_manageable(), which returns
true if a device has either _PR0 or _PS0.

  Per ACPI r6.5, sec 7.3, ACPI control of device power states uses
  Power Resources (i.e., the _ON/_OFF methods of _PRx) or _PSx
  methods.  Hence acpi_pci_power_manageable() checks for the presence
  of _PR0 or _PS0.

Tangent unrelated to *this* patch: I don't know how to think about the
pci_use_mid_pm() in platform_pci_power_manageable() because I haven't
seen a MID spec.  pci_use_mid_pm() isn't dependent on "dev", so we
claim *all* PCI devices, even external ones, are power manageable by
the platform, which doesn't seem right.

Does this refer specifically to D3cold?

I assume that if we were talking about D3hot, we wouldn't need to
check for ACPI support because D3hot behavior should be fully covered
by the PCIe spec.

Let's be specific about D3hot vs D3cold whenever possible.

If ACPI says a device is not power-manageable, i.e., ACPI doesn't know
how to put it in D0, it makes sense to return "false" here so we don't
try to put it in D3cold.

But I don't understand the ROOT_PORT check.  We may have a Switch
described via ACPI, and the ROOT_PORT check means we can return "true"
(it's OK to use D3cold) even if the Switch Port is not power-manageable
via ACPI.
