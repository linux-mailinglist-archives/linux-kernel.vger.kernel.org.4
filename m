I should add, though, that I don't fault you for lack of interest in TPM
1.2. Folks work on what they care about. If the rest of the TPM team has
a similar feeling, maybe it's best to just merge [3], rather than let
the bug linger forever? And possibly talk about sunsetting TPM 1 support
entirely if there's nobody to work on it and fix issues that inevitably
will come up? Just trying to look at the big picture here, you know...
