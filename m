OK, I see. But is memcg charging actually a RT friendly operation in the
first place? Please note that this path can trigger memory reclaim and
that is when any RT expectations are simply going down the drain.

And anytime the charging path (consume_stock resp. refill_stock)
contends with the remote draining which is out of control of the RT
task. It is true that the RT kernel will turn that spin lock into a
sleeping RT lock and that could help with potential priority inversions
but still quite costly thing I would expect.

Now I am not sure I understand. If you do not consider charging path to
be RT sensitive then why is this needed in the first place? What else
would be populating the pcp cache on the isolated cpu? IRQs?
