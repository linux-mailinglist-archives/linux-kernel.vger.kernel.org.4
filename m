Let me see if I understand this correctly as I can think of a few options
that perhaps are inline with what you are thinking.

1) All the portdrv stuff converted to normal PCI core helper functions
   that a driver bound to the struct pci_dev can use.
2) Driver core itself provides a bunch of extra devices alongside the
   struct pci_dev one to which additional drivers can bind? - so kind
   of portdrv handling, but squashed into the PCI device topology?
3) Have portdrv operated under the hood, so all the services etc that
   it provides don't require a driver to be bound at all.  Then
   allow usual VID/DID based driver binding.

If 1 - we are going to run into class device restrictions and that will
just move where we have to handle the potential vendor specific parts.
We probably don't want that to be a hydra with all the functionality
and lookups etc driven from there, so do we end up with sub devices
of that new PCI port driver with a discover method based on either
vsec + VID or DVSEC with devices created under the main pci_dev.
That would have to include nastiness around interrupt discovery for
those sub devices. So ends up roughly like port_drv.

I don't think 2 solves anything.

For 3 - interrupts and ownership of facilities is going to be tricky
as initially those need to be owned by the PCI core (no device driver bound)
and then I guess handed off to the driver once it shows up?  Maybe that
driver should call a pci_claim_port() that gives it control of everything
and pci_release_port() that hands it all back to the core.  That seems
racey.

As another similar proposal to 3 (and one Greg KH will hate :) can we
do something similar to vfio and allow an unbind of a class driver followed by
a bind of a more specific one? 

I think 1 is probably the easiest to implement, but it just moves
the problem.

If we had a way to reliably override the class driver if a more specific
one exists, that might work around the problem but I don't think we
can do that currently.
