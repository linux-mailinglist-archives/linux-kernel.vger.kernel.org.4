Is that really the relevant semantic though? I thought the point was to 
prevent userspace (or anyone else for that matter) taking ownership of a 
device with reserved regions which we can't trust them to honour. Not 
least because the series is entitled "Prevent RESV_DIRECT devices from 
user assignment", not anything about attaching to blocking domains. Plus 
the existing intel-iommu behaviour being generalised is specific to 
IOMMU_DOMAIN_UNMANAGED.

On reflection, I don't think that aspect actually matters anyway - 
nobody can explicitly request attachment to a blocking domain, so if the 
only time they're used is when the IOMMU driver has already had a 
catastrophic internal failure such that we decide to declare the device 
toasted and deliberately put it into an unusable state, blocking its 
reserved regions doesn't seem like a big deal. In fact if anything it 
kind of feels like the right thing to do for that situation. We're 
saying that we want the device to stop accessing memory because things 
might be in an inconsistent state which we can't trust; who says that 
mappings of RESV_DIRECT regions haven't also gone wonky? Having BLOCKED 
mean that the device truly cannot access - and thus potentially corrupt 
- *any* memory anywhere seems like the most robust and useful behaviour.

Thanks,
Robin.
