SCX implements ->pick_task() and the CORE selection path calls ->balance()
and then ->pick_task(). That should work, right? Will test later.

Can't it take the same approach as CFS? The BPF scheduler is gonna be the
one defining the relative priorities among SCX tasks, so that's where the
decision belongs.

The main source of difference is that we can't implicitly trust the BPF
scheduler and if it malfunctions or on user request, the system should
always be recoverable, so there are some extra things which are inherently
necessary to support that.

Yeah, this part is an interface design choice. Currently, when the BPF
scheduler fails or is not present for any reason, SCX falls back to CFS
because that seemed like the least invasive way to go about it, but it's
trivial to just let SCX do dumb FIFO scheduling with the global DSQ instead,
which in fact is already used during transition to guarantee forward
progress.

Thanks.
