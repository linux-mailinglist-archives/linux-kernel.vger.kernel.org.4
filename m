Yes, we could not do it if the set_pub_key/set_priv_key methods use 
internally the passed pointer. I guess it depends on the methods, for 
RSA and ECDSA it seems fine (they copy to a different location).

The doubt comes because the buffer is freed after crypto_wait_req() and 
not after crypto_akcipher_set_*_key(), suggesting that it could be 
actually used during the crypto operation.

Rechecked the thread, and the suggestion to reuse the buffer and not 
append the signature and digest at the end was by Eric Biggers.

Eric, in light of this finding, should we still reuse the buffer?

Thanks
