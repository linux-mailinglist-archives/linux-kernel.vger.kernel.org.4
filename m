Hi,

I am sorry for answering this so late. It somehow fallen under cracks.

IMHO, this is the reason why we should make it per-object.

If the shadow variable was used by a livepatched module and we remove
this module then the shadow variables would get unmaintained. It would
results in the problem described in this paragraph.

I agree that these mistakes might happen. And I really do not see
any reasonable way how to auto-detect which livepatched object uses
which shadow variables.

Well, the per-object registration allows to register all shadow
types for the "vmlinux" object that is always loaded. It would
work as you suggested. I mean that it would keep the shadow variables
registered as long as the livepatch is loaded.

But I would still like to keep the registration per-object.
It would allow to handle re-load of livepatched modules
the right way when needed.

And I agree that we should document these pitfalls in the documentation.

I do not think that it made the API much worse. It actually made some
things more safe and easier.

The ctor/dtor callbacks are defined by the shadow type. It removes
the risk to passing a wrong one.

Also there is not need to free the unused shadow variables in
post_un() callbacks. It was actually pretty tricky because
it required the reference counting.
