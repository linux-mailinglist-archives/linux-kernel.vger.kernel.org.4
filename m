Oh. Just saw your new selftest code, and fininally get your point(I hope
so...).  Thanks!

Well, suppose
- cpu_has_vmx_rdrand() is true;
- meanwhile guest_cpuid_has(vcpu, X86_FEATURE_RDRAND) is false.

And then, what vmx_adjust_secondary_exec_control() currently does is:
1> keep the SECONDARY_EXEC_RDRAND_EXITING set in L1 secondary proc-
based execution control.
2> and then clear the SECONDARY_EXEC_RDRAND_EXITING in the high bits
of IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 MSR for nested by
        vmx->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high &= ~control;
That means for L1 VMM, SECONDARY_EXEC_RDRAND_EXITING must be cleared
in its(VMCS12's) secondary proc-based VM-execution control, even when
rdrand is disabled in L1's and L2's CPUID.

I wonder, for native environment, if an instruction is not supported,
will the allowed 1-setting for its corresponding exiting feature in
IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 MSR be set, or be cleared? Maybe it should
be cleared, and executing such instruction in non-root will just get
a #UD directly instead of triggering a VM-Exit?

Note: I do not think this will cause any problem, just curious if L1
VMM can observe a behavior that's not supposed to be in native scenario(
only because what we are doing in KVM).
