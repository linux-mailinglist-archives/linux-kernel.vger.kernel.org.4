Reviewers raise concerns/issues and the submitters work to address
them or explain why they aren't an issue. The submitter has to push
things forward. That's how the process works.

As I noted, much of this is needed on a DT system with PCI device not
described in DT. So you could split out any ACPI system support to
avoid that concern for example. Enabling others to exercise these
patches may help too. Perhaps use QEMU to create some imaginary
device.
