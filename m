Hello Heiner

As I mentioned earlier I have some changes to take into account lo and hi regs incrementing.

But it's more convenient to base my patch on top on one of yours (https://lore.kernel.org/linux-amlogic/23fe625e-dc23-4db8-3dce-83167cd3b206@gmail.com/)

Is that ok if I resend your patch along with mine in series?

Best regards
George
