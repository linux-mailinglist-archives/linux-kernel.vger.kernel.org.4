These are stubs to integrate namespace support. I've been working on a
series that adds a tracing namespace support similiar to the IMA
namespace work [1]. That series is ending up taking more time than I
anticipated.

This is a good point, I'll delete this code and bring it back as part of
the namespace support patch series when appropriate.

Users that are given access to the single file still should be able to
be isolated for each other. The series I'm working on does this by
changing the system name of user_events on a per-namespace basis.

This prevents one namespace from messing with another, such as deleting
their events, etc. I'll reach out to you for some time to discuss this
direction to ensure I'm not off base.

In later series this is also called upon file open of user_events_data
to find the right group, etc. I'll get this code removed for now and
bring it back later.
