Something along those lines works if the facility is constrained to just
VSEC / DVSEC.
 * This one is.
 * CMA / SPDM / IDE all are - but with complexity of interrupts.
   After the plumbers SPDM BoF the resulting plan would not fit in the
   same model as this driver (need to be done earlier in PCI registration
   flow I think).  I need to write up and share some notes on what we
   are planning around that to get wider feedback - but might be a few
   weeks!

Others are less well confined.
 * CXL PMU uses registers in bar space - but is hanging off a DVSEC
   description to tell you where to find it.

I did that a few years back for our older PCI PMUs.  It wasn't pretty.

We never took that driver forwards - it was mostly useful to understand what
might work for newer hardware - we went the RCiEP route at least partly to avoid
software complexity (and because of hardware topology - counters shared by multiple
RP)

We could do something more generic along the same lines as the portdrv framework
 - that highlights some of the complexities however.
There are some nasty potential ordering issues in registering interest caused
by any attempt to make this work with modules.
I'd want to see a solution that works just as well for all the components that
might have DVSEC / VSEC entries - not just those covered by portdrv.

+CC Dan Williams and linux-cxl as they may also be interested in this discussion.
