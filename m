The user first calls SET_IRQS to enable MSI-X with some number of
vectors with (potentially) an eventfd for each vector.  The user later
calls SET_IRQS passing a -1 eventfd for one or more of the vectors with
an eventfd initialized in the prior step.  Given that we find the ctx,
the ctx has a trigger, and assuming dynamic allocation is supported, the
ctx is freed and vfio_msi_set_vector_signal() returns w/o allocating a
new ctx.  We've de-allocated both the irq and context initialized from
vfio_msi_enable().

That's not really possible given how we teardown the existing ctx
before configuring the new one and unwind to disable contexts in
vfio_msi_set_block()

If the goal is to allow the user to swap one eventfd for another, where
the result will always be the new eventfd on success or the old eventfd
on error, I don't see that this code does that, or that we've ever
attempted to make such a guarantee.  If the ioctl errors, I think the
eventfds are generally deconfigured.   We certainly have the unwind code
that we discussed earlier that deconfigures all the vectors previously
touched in the loop (which seems to be another path where we could
de-allocate from the set of initial ctxs).

A context is essentially meant to track a trigger, ie. an eventfd
provided by the user.  In the static case all the irqs are necessarily
pre-allocated, therefore we had no reason to consider a dynamic array
for the contexts.  However, a given context is really only "active" if
it has a trigger, otherwise it's just a placeholder.  When the
placeholder is filled by an eventfd, the pre-allocated irq is enabled.

This proposal seems to be a hybrid approach, pre-allocating some
initial set of irqs and contexts and expecting the differentiation to
occur only when new vectors are added, though we have some disagreement
about this per above.  Unfortunately I don't see an API to enable MSI-X
without some vectors, so some pre-allocation of irqs seems to be
required regardless.

But if non-active contexts were only placeholders in the pre-dynamic
world and we now manage them via a dynamic array, why is there any
pre-allocation of contexts without knowing the nature of the eventfd to
fill it?  We could have more commonality between cases if contexts are
always dynamically allocated, which might simplify differentiation of
the has_dyn_msix cases largely to wrappers allocating and freeing irqs.
Thanks,

Alex
