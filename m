While the SLRT is meant for UEFI and non-UEFI environments, DRTM is 
definitely a hold over when we started this and you are correct, 
probably not the best choice. In fact, I agree that SLRT is a far better 
magic. We will update the spec and fix it in the series.

Generally we would request that the bootloader submit a request to 
register for a value to be reserved in the spec. That aside, the intent 
here is to allow for the possibility for the DLE handler to be 
independent from the bootloader, but this does not have to be this way. 
If a non-open entity decides to produce their own implementation, they 
can freely use a unallocated value at their own risk that it could be 
allocated to another bootloader in the future. Though in this scenario 
it likely would not matter as the non-open DLE handler would only be 
present when the non-open bootloader was present.

Thank you for the review!
