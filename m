I presume we are talking about 873e2391e729...63761adbf5aa for TD pmu:

A quick glance brought me at least these comments:

(1) how does intel_pmu_save/restore() handle the enabled host LBR/PEBS ?
(2) guest PMI injection may be malicious and could the current guest pmu driver 
handle it ?
(3) how do we handle the case when host counters can be enabled before TDENTER
for debuggable TD and support the case like "perf-kvm for both guest and host" ?

My point is actually, changes to perf/core should be CC to the perf reviewers
as early as possible to prevent key player from killing the direction.

Yeah, plus the PUCK and LPC KVM micro-conference.

Detailed TD (plus debuggable) PMU selftest would clearly speed up the review 
process.

I totally agree that TD PMU (plus debuggable) support should not be the first 
part of the
code to be merged in, but the related discussion should be kicked off on day 0.
As a scenario for users using Intel TDX, it's expected to support "System 
Profiling Mode",
which was first introduced in 344425-001US but disappeared since version 003.
