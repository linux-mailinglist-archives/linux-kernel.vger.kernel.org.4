SNP guest support is already in Linux, and it gets a full view of the
memory given to the VM. If the firmware ever introduces unaccepted
memory, then the kernel's behavior is retroactively broken without the
"accept all if AllowUnacceptedMemory() not called" behavior of the
UEFI.
The memory that existed before becomes ignored. This is not the right
approach IMO.

What I'm saying is that you're suggesting a feature _dis_abling
requirement, which is an antipattern. Any SNP user right now would
need to add a "don't use an unimplemented feature" flag to get access
to all its memory again.

Usually it's not, but the retroactive need to create a new VM once the
firmware adds UEFI v2.9 support with unaccepted memory is a big deal.

A user buys access to a high memory VM: 768GiB. They then shut down
and bring it back up on a new firmware that uses unaccepted memory.

That VM goes from 785GiB free memory to 3GiB free memory at boot.

This is because all memory above 4GiB (and nothing there for the
3-4GiB MMIO hole) would be the unknown unaccepted memory type. We need
the accept-all-if-support-not-acked semantics with the protocol.

Gerd's response of after 6.1-lts EOL is reasonable to me. At the same
time, both SEV-SNP and TDX's Kconfig would need to strictly require
unaccepted memory.

The semantics of the UEFI under the proposed protocol is allowed to
change the default behavior when the protocol is not exposed to the
OS. The default would then be to always introduce unaccepted memory
for TDX and SEV-SNP guests.

To Gerd's point, removing "first in edk2, later in linux too" I think
is backwards. We need all users of the protocol to agree that SEV-SNP
and TDX strictly imply unaccepted memory support. Only then can we
remove the protocol from EDK2.

Thanks for your time discussing.
