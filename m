Thanks for the feedback - I had thought "is realm" was fairly
self-documenting, but perhaps I've just spent too much time with this code.

The usage is in the kvm_is_realm() function which is used in several of
the later patches as a way to detect this kvm guest is a realm guest.

I think the main issue is that I've got the patches in the wrong other.
Patch 7 "arm64: kvm: Allow passing machine type in KVM creation" should
probably be before this one, then I could add the assignment of is_realm
into this patch (potentially splitting out the is_realm parts into
another patch).

Thanks,

Steve
