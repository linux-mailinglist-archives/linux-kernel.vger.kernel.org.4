I think that was the overall gist: yes. But it's not what I was trying
to comment on :-).

HOWEVER, thinking about this more: I was confused when I wrote out my
last reply. I had thought that the issue that Michael brought up
applied even with UPM. That is, I was thinking it was still possibly
for a guest to maliciously convert a page to private mapped in by the
kernel and assumed to be shared.

But I now realize that is not what will actually happen. To be
concrete, let's assume the GHCB page. What will happen is:
- KVM has GHCB page mapped in. GHCB is always assumed to be shared. So
far so good.
- Malicious guest converts GHCB page to private (e.g., via Page State
Change request)
- Guest exits to KVM
- KVM exits to userspace VMM
- Userspace VM allocates page in private FD.

Now, what happens here depends on how UPM works. If we allow double
allocation then our host kernel is safe. However, now we have the
"double allocation problem".

If on the other hand, we deallocate the page in the shared FD, the
host kernel can segfault. And now we actually do have essentially the
same problem Michael was describing that we have without UPM. Because
we'll end up in fault.c in the kernel context and likely panic the
host.

I hope I got this right this time. Sorry for the confusion on my last reply.

Ack on merging without UPM. I wasn't trying to chime in on merging
before/after UPM. See my other comment above. Sorry for the confusion.
Ack on other concerns about "enlightening kmap" as well. I agree.
