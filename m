xHC Hardware has odd alignments and size restrictions that the driver anyway need to sort out.
The 64K is already fake, it's the most common max supported size for TRBs, but not always true.
Varies depending on TRB location in TRB ring.

xhci driver can handle any size.

As I've already raised, in this particular case I think it's actually the debug check that's misplaced, since it's not dma_map_sg() anyway, but as it stands, the implementations of dma_alloc_noncontiguous() are definitely doing the wrong thing with respect to what it is then asking to validate.

Agree that this seems to be an issue in the DMA debugging side.
Would it need to take into account cases where device driver can support different sizes than the host controller?

This would be all USB 3.x hosts, from all vendors.

keeping the 64K max seg size, and fixing the dma debug side would be optimal, but until that gets done I think
we can take this oneliner as it resolves a real world issue where USB isn't working.
