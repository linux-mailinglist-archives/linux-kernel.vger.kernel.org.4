Hi Saravana,

Thanks for the information.

I tested without the 12 patch series, just before commit 3a2dbc510c43
"driver core: fw_devlink: Don't purge child fwnode's consumer links".

I don't see the messages here. But I can see these on top of fb42378dcc7f.

Strangely, I tested without the series, and removed earlier patch from
Amelie. I don't reproduce the issue she used to hit.

Some good news here is, I've identified a recent change [1], that
creates the issue pointed above. I just sent a separate patch [2] for this.
So, it's not related to this series. (I managed to reproduce without
picking it).
