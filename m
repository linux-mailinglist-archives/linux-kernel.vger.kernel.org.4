[I'm not a h/w architect ... but I do write/support the Linux machine
check code]

Current edition of the SDM describes the MCA bit in CPUID(EAX=1).EDX in
volume 2, Table 3-11:

   Machine Check Architecture. A value of 1 indicates the Machine Check
   Architecture of reporting machine errors is supported. The MCG_CAP MSR
   contains feature bits describing how many banks of error reporting MSRs
   are supported

So a value of 0 would mean Machine check architecture is NOT supported.

The only rationale meaning for "Machine check architecture is supported"
is you get everything in Vol3B chapter 15 if MCA is supported, and you
don't get it if it isn't. The unsupported behaviour is not explicitly
defined ... so if you want the do something other than #GP, you could do
so ... but that sounds like s silly choice.

Ditto for accessing a machine check bank with number greater than that
specified in IA32_MCG_CAP.count. SDM doesn't say that this must #GP,
but #GP would be a sane and reasonble response. You could also read as
all zero and drop writes.
