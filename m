Yeah it would be great if you can contact Kees or other developers of
hardening to know their opinions about this, since I'm curious about
what they think of this as well.

For the effectiveness of this mechanism, I would like to provide some
results of the experiments I did. I conducted actual defense tests on
CVE-2021-22555 and CVE-2016-8655 by reverting fixing patch to recreate
exploitable environments, and running the exploits/PoCs on the
vulnerable kernel with and without our randomized kmalloc caches patch.
With our patch, the originally exploitable environments were not pwned
by running the PoCs.
