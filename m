I agree with you about a unit test should focus on a single behavior. But
I have concerns that each test suite uses different definitions of the
same structure, mgr/bridge stats, mgr/bridge ops, mgr/bridge ctx. Even
if we have full definitions for these structures to acommodate all
tests, it doesn't break the principle of unit test, just ignore the fields
and skip checks that you don't care. E.g. only checks mgr.write_count &
bridge.enable_count for region test.

And a single module simplifies the implementation.

struct mgr_stats {
	...
};

struct mgr_ctx {
	struct fpga_image_info *img_info;
	struct fpga_manager *mgr;
	struct platform_device *pdev;
	struct mgr_stats stats;
};

struct bridge_stats {
	...
};

struct bridge_ctx {
	struct fpga_bridge *bridge;
	struct platform_device *pdev;
	struct bridge_stats stats;
};

struct region_ctx {
	struct mgr_ctx mgr_ctx;
	struct bridge_ctx bridge_ctx;

	struct fpga_region *region;
	struct platform_device *region_pdev;
};

How do you think?
