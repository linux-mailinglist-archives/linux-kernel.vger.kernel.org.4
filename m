You are right, we dont need it.

Right, it is.

Sure, will drop this optimization completely. I will split the iteration into two
separate loops, one each for bank 0 and other for bank 1.

This function will not be required once individual loops based read for each
BRBE bank is implemented, thus reducing number of times select_brbe_bank()
gets called i.e just two times once for bank 0 and other for bank 1.

You mean pr_debug() based prints ?

Right, these are generic perf options. As you mentioned, will replace these with
pr_debug() instead.

But with a negative list, user would know what is not supported via these pr_debug()
based output when enabled ? But I dont have a strong opinion either way.

Could you please be more specific ? alloc_percpu_gfp() cannot be used here
because 'events->branches' is not a __percpu variable unlike its parent
'events' which is derived from armpmu.

Sure, will change that.

Sure, understood.

Called from smp_call_function_any() context via __armv8pmu_probe_pmu().

Right, it does. Remember dropping pr_info() during BRBE probe for the exact same
reason here but did not realize we will run into the same problem again.

Right, will do that. The only problem being 'struct brbe_hw_attr' which will not be
visible in the main thread, might need an abstraction function to do the allocation
in BRBE implementation. Regardless, a successful BRBE in the preceding function can
be ascertained from armpmu->has_branch_stack().

Sure, but shall we change fetch as get for entire BRBE implementation (where ever
there is a determination of field from a register value) or just the above function ?
Default, will change all places.

That is right, will add a comment.

Right, that is my understanding as well.

With FEAT_VHE and HCR_EL2.E2H = 1, access to BRBCR_EL1 at EL2, accesses BRBCR_EL2
without FEAT_VHE or HCR_EL2.E2H = 0, access to BRBCR_EL1 at EL2, accesses BRBCR_EL1

This is just a code hardening measure here. Before recording branch record
cycles or its flags, ensure BRBCR_EL1 was configured correctly to produce
these additional information along with the branch records.

With TX = 0 i.e no transaction was active, indicates normal sequence of branches
creating their own branch records. How can there be a transaction with TX = 0 ?
Could you please be more specific here ?

I guess these are micro-architectural implementation details which unfortunately
BRBINF_EL1/BRBCR_EL1 specifications do not capture in detail. But all it says is
that upon encountering BRBINF_EL1.LASTFAILED or BRBFCR_EL1.LASTFAILED (just for
the last record) all previous in-transaction branch records (BRBINF_EL1.TX = 1)
should be considered aborted for branch record reporting purpose.

The base IRQ handler armv8pmu_handle_irq() is in ARMV8 PMU code inside perf_event.c
which could/should not access BRBE specific details without adding an another new
abstraction function. But I guess adding a comment should be fine.

This disables BRBE completely (not only pause) providing confidence that no
branch record can come in while the existing records are being processed.

armv8pmu_branch_read() always gets called from an IRQ context only. The point
here is to force a pause (and also disable, as I had explained earlier) before
reading the buffer.

Yes, this guarantees (more so than the paused state) that BRBE remains disabled in
privilege levels that are relevant, while the contents are being read.

This is the last opportunity for a clean slate start for BRBE buffer before it is
back recording the branches. Basically helps in ensuring a clean start.

Yes, it should be paused after an IRQ but it is also enforced before reading along
with privilege level disable. Regardless the buffer needs to be un-paused and also
enabled for required privilege levels before exiting from here.
