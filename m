It seems your calculation had (512MB+64KB), instead of (512MB+4KB).
In this particular patch, we still have (512MB+4KB). How about to change
like below in this patch. In next patch, it's adjusted accordingly after
we have (512MB+64KB).

(1) In this patch, the comment is changed to as below

     /*
      * We have different number of memory slots, excluding the reserved
      * memory slot 0, on various architectures and configurations. The
      * memory size in this test is calculated by doubling the maximal
      * memory size in last memory slot, with alignment to the largest
      * supported page size (64KB).
      *
      * architecture   slots    memory-per-slot    memory-on-last-slot
      * --------------------------------------------------------------
      * x86-4KB        32763    16KB               100KB
      * arm64-4KB      32766    16KB               52KB
      * arm64-64KB     8192     64KB               64KB
      */
     #define MEM_TEST_MOVE_SIZE	0x40000           /* 256KB */

(2) In the next patch, where we have (512MB+64KB) after the various
     memory sizes are consolidated, It is adjusted accordingly as below.

     /*
      * We have different number of memory slots, excluding the reserved
      * memory slot 0, on various architectures and configurations. The
      * memory size in this test is calculated by doubling the maximal
      * memory size in last memory slot, with alignment to the largest
      * supported page size (64KB).
      *
      * architecture   slots    memory-per-slot    memory-on-last-slot
      * --------------------------------------------------------------
      * x86-4KB        32763    16KB               160KB
      * arm64-4KB      32766    16KB               112KB
      * arm64-64KB     8192     64KB               128KB
      */
     #define MEM_TEST_MOVE_SIZE	0x50000           /* 320KB */

Thanks,
Gavin
