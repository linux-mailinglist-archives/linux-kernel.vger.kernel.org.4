The memory size of the machine or how heavy the workloads it runs have
nothing to do with MAX_ORDER. Again, x86 and s390 are perfectly fine with
MAX_ORDER == 10 ...

... but this indeed could be the reason to increase MAX_ORDER.

Yeah, if we'd knew what exactly requires such huge contiguous allocation,
we probably could fix that and leave Kconfig alone.
