It obviously doesn't have zero overhead.

And correctness and maintainability trumps micro-optimizations.

What do you mean by "replace the kernel functions"? You mean an existing
kernel function can be replaced by a bpf program? Like live patching?

This seems rather dangerous, and how does one know that their system has
integrity? Is there a feature to sign bpf programs before they can be added?

Also, it may be time to bring in the lawyers. If a bpf program can replace
an existing kernel function, then it has definitely passed the "user space"
exception to the GPL, where user space must use the system call interface.
By injecting executable code into the kernel, especially something that
replaces kernel functionality, it becomes arguably derived from the kernel
itself. And the BPF program must be GPL.

Allowing proprietary BPF programs to replace kernel functionality looks
like a clear violation and circumvention of the GPL. But I could be
mistaken. As I said, it's time to bring in the lawyers on this one.

Please explain why? The recursion protection lock is a simply bit operation
on the task struct which is used to protect against recursion at the same
context. Which if you do not have, will likely happen, and the only hint of
it is that the system triple faults and reboots. If you are only hooking to
one function, then it is easy to figure this out. But with the multi work
being done, that is no longer the case.

Hooking to functions is *extremely* intrusive. And protection against
errors is a must have, and not an option.

The recursion lock allows recursions, but not at the same context. That is,
interrupt against normal context is fine. But really, you should not have
it within the same context. How do you verify that you do not run out of
stack?

Neither should fprobes / ftrace.
