There's a *slight* difference: the certain vendor you've mentioned is 
historically uncooperative in providing the documentation, so outside 
contributors had to reverse-engineer and document the HW themselves; but 
in Loongson's case, you *are* the vendor, so you are probably in a 
position that can make everyone's life easier by at least pushing for 
the docs release...

Sorry for the confusion at my side; `.word` certainly works, what 
doesn't work currently seems to be the `parse_r` helper. I know because 
I've tried in the last week with latest LLVM/Clang snapshot. And you 
can't write ergonomic inline asm with proper register allocator 
awareness without the helper; the LoongArch assembler isn't capable of 
assembling in a certain encoding format. With RISC-V `.insn` you can do 
things like `.insn r 0xNN, 0, 0, a0, a1, a2`, but you cannot simply e.g. 
express gcsrxchg with `.insn DJK 0x05000000, a0, a1, a2` because no such 
instruction format convention has been standardized. (The notation 
demonstrated here is taken from [1].)

In any case, it seems best to at least wait for the documentation 
release a little bit, or you should state clearly that this is not going 
to happen soon, so people can properly manage their expectation and 
prioritize. (For example, if I know docs and/or assembler support for 
the virtualization extension won't come soon, then I'd work on 
supporting the .word idiom before other things. Otherwise there are more 
important things than that.)
