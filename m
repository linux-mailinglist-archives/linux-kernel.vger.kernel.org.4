Yes its quite old patch series. I was tracking a regression for teams 
moving to a newer 5.10 (although that's also old) kernel from 4.14.

So database team was a running benchmark called hammerdb with 16 
connections where they started noticing dropped
performance for 5.10. We traced it back to filesystem with this 
benchmark. Although the database workload would be something similar
  I guess.

This is quite consistent. The thing to note here is this test is on 
4.14+ tip with and without
these patch series.
I tried reverting to the same behavior in 5.10 with the following patch 
but i only see a very low improvement. (~1%)

This is because on 5.10 we also have this patch
ext4: avoid unnecessary transaction starts during writeback. (This 
limits the invocation of this function within the while loop)
If i revert the above patch as well along with applying below patch i 
get back around 4% IOPS.

-       if (end == (pgoff_t)-1)
-               *index = (pgoff_t)-1;
-       else
-               *index = end + 1;
+       if (xas.xa_index > end) {
+               if (end == (pgoff_t)-1)
+                       *index = (pgoff_t)-1;
+               else
+                       *index = end + 1;
+       }
+       else if (ret)
+               *index = xas.xa_index + 1;

Ok so its more of a security concern. But do you think this has a 
latency impact? I didn't see
much latency impact between the two sets and throughput is higher.
