Moreover, it is possible that the bridge passed to acpi_pci_bridge_d3() has its
own _S0W or a wakeup GPE if it is power-manageable via ACPI.  In those cases
it is not necessary to ask the Root Port's _S0W about wakeup from D3, so overall
I would go for the patch like the below (not really tested).

This works in the same way as the current code (unless I have missed anything)
except for the case when the "target" bridge is power-manageable via ACPI, but
it cannot signal wakeup via ACPI and has no _S0W.  In that case it will consult
the upstream Root Port's _S0W to check whether or not wakeup from D3 is
supported.

[Note that if dev_has_acpi_pm is 'true', it is kind of pointless to look for the
"HotPlugSupportInD3" property of the Root Port, because the function is going to
return 'true' regardless, but I'm not sure if adding an extra if () for handling
this particular case is worth the hassle.]
