Hi Daniel,

Thanks for taking a look. The reason I choose to do this in jited progs is
because JIT is used in most real cases, so does testing/fuzzing, e.g.,
syzbot test BPF with JIT_ALWAYS_ON=3Dy. Also, a BPF program generated
by fuzzers or other tools is likely need to be run hundred times with rando=
m
inputs to trigger potential issues in it and be captured by sanitize, so JI=
T
makes this much faster.

We don't need changes in every BPF JIT I believe, supporting X86_64
and Arm64 would be enough, and the only thing need to be done there
is to backup regs on stack before calling checking functions.
Also, I'm wondering if anyone knows how to better make sure the checking
function won't corrupt scratch regs' states, e.g., a flag to force compiler=
 to
push scratch regs before using them, during gen code for those funcs.
If this is feasible, the changes to JIT can be completely removed, and
fixup in the verifier would be enough.

Regards
Hao
