Yeah most distros have ~100 ore more patches against GRUB, but this
isn't actually their fault. GRUB maintainership was defunct for a
number of years, which is why we were stuck on GRUB version 2.02-beta3
for such a long time. But in recent years, things have been getting
better, and there is an agreement with the current maintainer not to
merge the EFI handover protocol, and merge the new EFI protocol based
initrd loading method instead, which works on all architectures
instead of only on x86.

I'd rather not - see below.

I'll adopt some of that thanks.

Never tried that in .S files but I guess it should just work.

I'd venture a guess that this will break the boot even your own x86
boxes, given that almost nobody uses plain upstream GRUB..

I can work with the distros directly to start disabling this in their
downstream configs once their GRUB builds are up to date with the new
changes, so we can phase this out in a controlled manner. But
disabling tthis right now by default is going to affect everyone who
builds their own kernels and runs them on a distro Linux install.
