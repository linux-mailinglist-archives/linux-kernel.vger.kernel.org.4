The SPDX header has to be a C++ comment, please make the rest of
this a C++ comment.

You're saying that this is generic but it's really not looking
very generic at all, like I say there's a bunch of assumptions in
the code that look entirely specific to your implementation here.
Any abstraction and reusability seems extremely unclear, I'm not
seeing what this is doing that is diffrent to the driver using
this providing it's own register read and write operations.

No, what I'm objecting to there is pretty much the same thing I'm
saying here - this doesn't seem like it's a particularly generic
implementation and I'm really not clear that there'd be anything
meaningful left by the time the implementation assumptions are
removed.
