Does it also mean that, the honor PAT in such no-fill cache mode should
also happen for non-quirk case ? e.g. the effective memory type can be
WC if EPT is UC + guest PAT is WC for CD=1.

the quirk may not work after this patch if the guest PAT is
stronger than WB for CD=1, we don't if any guest "works correctly" based
on this quirk, I hope no. How about highlight this in commit message
explicitly ?

Also I agree that such issue should be fixed in guest not in KVM.
