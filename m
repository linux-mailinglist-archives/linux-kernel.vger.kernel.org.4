Bjorn/all,

I'll try to at least clarify from what I remember from "back then",
since it's over 4,5 years that I last actively worked on mainlining the
vendor driver and not being affiliated with the vendor at all.

MSI being defaulted to disabled with the possibility to try
ddbridge.msi=3D1 is the result of quite a bit of user feedback mainly at
vdr-portal.de, recommendations from the vendor itself in case of I2C
troubles with their cards, plus an explanation from them (been in
contact with the vendor at that time) telling me that "some"
PCIe/chipsets are buggy especially with regards to MSI and thus can
cause trouble with their cards. Also, in addition, I experienced I2C
troubles with ddbridge.msi=3D1 myself so I decided to make the default
"0" (with an option to toggle the default marked as "dangerous" due to
the known possible issues) as this worked the best for everyone who
opted for testing the mainlined driver code. Due to lack of real
knowledge about chipsets, PCIe, interrupts and so on, and lack of
technical docs about the cards, we could only assume we're dealing with
some sort of incompatibility between the cards and possibly certain
components, though ddbridge.msi=3D0 made everything play nicely with each
other.

Regarding #208507, I see that there are chipsets and/or platforms that
either soft-disable legacy IRQ signalling/routing (via the
mentioned/reverted/bisected commit), or even don't support this at all
and thus make MSI a requirement, and causing interrupts not being
serviced at all if MSI isn't available or enabled by the device.

If it is possible to query the underlying subsystems regarding
availability of legacy interrupt signalling, I guess the best option is
to perform such evaluation in the ddbridge driver during setup and
enable MSI signalling if that's the only option regardless of
ddbridge.msi=3Dx, what seems safe on such platforms according to the
reporter (card running fine with msi=3D1).

I'll happily provide patches for such a change though I would very
welcome any guidance on the subsystem query topic.

Best regards,
Daniel
