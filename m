I'm not saying it is never used inappropriately. But using a memory
type that gets mapped into the runtime services page tables every time
a runtime service call is made is pointless, fragments both the EFI
page tables as well as the kernel direct map for no reason.

In spite of the name, that is not really true. It is reclaimable
memory, which means that the OS can use the memory as conventional
memory after consuming its contents, or discarding them.

No, that is something completely different. Using unusable memory for
anything would be silly.

EFI loader data and EFI boot services data are the exact same thing
from this POV. They have no significance to the runtime firmware, and
can be used as ordinary available memory after ExitBootServices().

In this case, I don't think this is unreasonable for configuration
tables, which only have a GUID and a base address. If the OS knows the
GUID, and knows how to interpret the contents, it can decide for
itself whether or not to preserve it. If it doesn't know the GUID, the
memory is just treated as available memory [after EBS()]

I personally think reclaimable memory is more suitable for these
cases, which is why I am willing to consider that as well. Note that
the EFI spec now also mandates device trees on ARM to be passed via
EfiAcpiReclaimMemory, simply because it is the memory type suitable
for firmware tables that only the OS consumes.
