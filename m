We discussed things at length at the time, but perhaps it was before you
joined to project. As I alluded to above, we should not play the game of
using arbitrary numbers but instead fix the interconnect driver so that
it can map the interconnect values in kBps to something that makes sense
for the Qualcomm hardware. Anything else is not acceptable for upstream.
