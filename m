Yeah that's certainly an option. The downside is that all functions
within scope of the __diag_push() will be affected, and sometimes we mix
kfuncs with non-kfuncs (including e.g. static helper functions that are
used by the kfuncs themselves). -Wmissing-prototypes isn't a big deal,
but __used and noinline are kind of unfortunate. Not a big deal though,
it'll just result in a few extra __bpf_kfuncs_start() and
__bpf_kfuncs_end() sprinkled throughout to avoid them being included.
The upside is of course that we can get rid of the __diag_push()'es we
currently have to prevent -Wmissing-prototypes.

Wdyt? I do like the idea of getting rid of those ugly __diag_push()'es.
And we could always go back to using a __bpf_kfunc macro if and when
compilers ever support using attributes to ignore warnings for specific
functions.

Sure, if we keep this approach I'll do this in v2.
