This could also be used by certain keyboard or mice receivers, if the
keyboard or mouse is kept constantly connected and there's a way to
find out whether it's connected or not.

"wireless" isn't the attribute user-space would be interested in,
"wireless status" would be. If the headset's wireless status is
"disconnected", then the headset is unavailable. Then user-space can
route the audio accordingly.

Yes, although I haven't found devices where this would be useful.

I'll reimplement this as an interface attribute.

Thanks very much to you and Alan for the quick replies.
