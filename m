No. The efforts seems to be mostly focused on supporting a setup where shim
boots grub. Anything besides this has never really been important for the people
writing it.

The main reason for the email is to try and figure out what the EFI
configuration table adds to the threat model.

So the only trusted agent currently is the shim? It claims to be a "trivial EFI
application" but the interplay between mokutils and shim isn't documented and
not trivial to understand.

Would this change if the variable could be read from the EFI configuration table
or as an EFI variable? Instead of the current situation where we only support
the configuration table?

I assume it's a yes to "intentional design decision", and my followup question
to this would be to ask where it's documented?

The present features are all disabled by default I believe?

Most of this seems to be knowledge residing between a few people that was
present at the implementation, and as a user-space tool author comming into this
10 years later, it's really hard to figure out how a lot of these decisions came
to be.
