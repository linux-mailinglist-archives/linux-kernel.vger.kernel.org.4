I do recognize your need to control the demotion but I argue that it is
a bad idea to rely on an implicit behavior of the memory reclaim and an
interface which is _documented_ to primarily _reclaim_ memory.

Really, consider that the current demotion implementation will change
in the future and based on a newly added heuristic memory reclaim or
compression would be preferred over migration to a different tier.  This
might completely break your current assumptions and break your usecase
which relies on an implicit demotion behavior.  Do you see that as a
potential problem at all? What shall we do in that case? Special case
memory.reclaim behavior?

Now to your specific usecase. If there is a need to do a memory
distribution balancing then fine but this should be a well defined
interface. E.g. is there a need to not only control demotion but
promotions as well? I haven't heard anybody requesting that so far
but I can easily imagine that like outsourcing the memory reclaim to
the userspace someone might want to do the same thing with the numa
balancing because $REASONS. Should that ever happen, I am pretty sure
hooking into memory.reclaim is not really a great idea.

See where I am coming from?
