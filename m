James, are you or some other TPM developer looking into this? Or is this
deadlocked now? And if so: how can we get this unstuck to get this
regression solved?

Side note: I wonder if the problem that Johannes reported yesterday in
this thread (
https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y7VCcgHUC6JtnO2b@gmail.com/
) is related or something else, as it seems his issue happens with 6.1,
while Vlastimil's problems should be fixed there. Or am I missing something?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
