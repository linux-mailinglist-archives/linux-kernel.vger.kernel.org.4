That seems like a reasonable approach to me. Tables like MEMATTR or
RT_PROP are mostly relevant for bare metal where the host kernel maps
the runtime services, and in general, passing on these tables without
knowing what they do is kind of fishy anyway. You might even argue
that only known table types should be forwarded in the first place,
regardless of the memory type.
