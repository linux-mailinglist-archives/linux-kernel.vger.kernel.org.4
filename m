Yes, my apologies, after re-reading the APM I agree with you.

Yes, this is how I understand it as well.

Note that there are two cases when we need an interrupt window in nested case:

- If the L1 doesn't intercept interrupts, which is what we are taking about here.
- If the L1 does intercept interrupts, but let L2 control the L1's EFLAGS.IF and/or
  L1's GIF 
  (that is V_INTR_MASKING_MASK is not set, and/or L1 doesn't intercept STGI/CLGI).

  In this case a 'real' interrupt will be converted to a VM exit but only
  when both L1's EFLAGS.IF is true and L1's GIF is true.

How about instead moving this code to svm_set_vintr?

That is, in the guest mode, if the guest has V_INTR_MASKING_MASK, then
then a nested VM exit is the next point the interrupt window could open,
thus we don't set VINTR)

Or even better put the logic in svm_enable_irq_window (that is avoid
calling svm_set_vintr in the first place).

I also think that it worth it to add a warning that 'svm_set_intercept'
didn't work, that is didn't really set an intercept. 
In theory that can result in nasty CVEs in addition to logic bugs as you found.

This makes sense.

This won't be needed if we don't call the svm_set_vintr in the first place.

With all this said, I also want to note that this patch has *nothing* to do with VNMI,
I only added it due to some refactoring, so feel free to drop it from vNMI queue,
and deal with those bugs separately.
