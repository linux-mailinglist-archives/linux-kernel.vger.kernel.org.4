About a year ago, Greg K-H asked me (and another developer who was working
with me) to split a small batch of 5 patches into more than 20. He explained
pretty much the same reasons why we should split patches into smaller parts,
easier to understand and review. It's also much easier for the developers
themselves to prepare and debug before committing.

I thought I got the message, but I fell into the same trap again and sent one
big patch (two if we're even talking about fs/sysv) which is not so easy to
review. I guess that's why they've been set aside and not commented on for a
long time.

I was just kidding when I was talking about those "10 minutes". At the same
time I wanted to underline how the things that are difficult for me are much
easier for you to analyze and solve.

What follows is a great lesson about how to (1) make sense of what this change
is doing (2) how it is doing it (3) how we can optimize (especially how to
remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity.

The lessons which follow are great. Furthermore, I'm also having the
opportunity to follow your mental process. That will also help very much with
this task and also in future.

I see no need to reply to each of the suggestions you provided with such
clarity and huge amount of details.

As I already said I'll rework trying to do my best, although it will take some
time because of several personal reasons that are of no interests to the
readers.

I'm sincerely grateful to you for spending so much time (forget those 10
minutes, please) to help me.

Again, thank you very much,

Fabio
