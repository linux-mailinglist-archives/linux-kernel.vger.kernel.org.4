Can you tell whether there's a device present, e.g., via Slot Status
Presence Detect?  If there's nothing in the slot, I don't know why we
would print anything at all.  If a card is present but there's no
link, that's probably worthy of dev_info() or even dev_err().

I guess if you can tell the slot is empty, there's no point in even
trying to start the link, so you could avoid both the message and the
timeout by not even calling dw_pcie_wait_for_link().
