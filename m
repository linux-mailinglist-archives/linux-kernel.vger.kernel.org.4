It is the right thing to do IMHO, but I guess the implications are just too
hard to tell to enforce it by default yet. Which is I guess why it's all
protected by PREEMPT_RT still.

(I'm not sure but I assumed that logically PREEMPT_RT would convert all mutex
to rt_mutexes by default)

It depends on the worst case scenario of spinning. If we can ensure it's
bounded to something small, then yeah I don't see an issue :-)
