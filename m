Could you give more details of how often does it happen? Is it stably
reproducible or does it happen at very rare occasion?

Well, I can't know that either.) The only one who can figure it out is
you, at least at this stage (I doubt Gustavo will ever get back to
reviewing and testing the driver on his remote eDMA device). I can
help if you provide some more details about the platform you are
using, about the low-level driver (is it
drivers/dma/dw-edma/dw-edma-pcie.o?) which gets to detect the DW eDMA
remote device and probes it by the DW eDMA core.

reproduce and debug the problem discovered by you.

What do you mean by "two types of memory"? From the CPU perspective
they are the same. Both are mapped via MMIO by means of a PCIe Root
Port outbound memory window.

From your description there is no guarantee that reading from the
remote device solves the race for sure. If writes have been collected
in a cache, then the intermediate read shall return a data from the
cache with no data being flushed to the device memory. It might be
possible that in your case the read just adds some delay enough for
some independent activity to flush the cache. Thus the problem you
discovered may get back in some other circumstance. Moreover based on
the PCI Express specification "A Posted Request must not pass another
Posted Request unless a TLP has RO (Relaxed ordering) or IDO (ID-based
ordering) flag set." So neither intermediate PCIe switches nor the
PCIe host controller is supposed to re-order simple writes unless the
Root Port outbound MW is configure to set the denoted flags. In anyway
all of that is platform specific. So in order to have it figured out
we need more details from the platform from you.

Meanwhile:

Q1 are you sure that neither dma_wmb() nor io_stop_wc() help to solve
the problem in your case?

Q2 Does specifying a delay instead of the dummy read before the
doorbell update solve the problem?
