Sorry wasn't obvious to me (late to the party so if it was in some
other v* described apologies). Can we say something about the life
cycle of this acquired task_structs because they are incrementing
the ref cnt on the task struct they have potential to impact system.
I know at least we've had a few bugs in our task struct tracking
that has led to various bugs where we leak references. In our case
we didn't pin the kernel object so the leak is just BPF memory and
user space memory, still sort of bad because we would hit memory
limits and get OOM'd. Leaking kernel task structs is worse though.

quick question. If you put acquired task struct in a map what
happens if user side deletes the entry? Presumably this causes the
release to happen and the task_struct is good to go. Did I miss
the logic? I was thinking you would have something in bpf_map_free_kptrs
and a type callback to release() the refcnt?
