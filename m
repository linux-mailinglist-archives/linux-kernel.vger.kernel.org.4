This is my understanding. IMHO, if we define
watchdog_hardlockup_probe() in /arch/sparc/kernel/nmi.c
then we could remove the CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG check from
the default watchdog_hardlockup_probe().

Honestly, I am afraid that nobody really thought about any rules.
People were just adding their stuff any way that worked for them.
And this is why we ended with this maze.

It is not your fault. You just moved the ifdef from the header file
into the function definition. But it showed very well how ugly it was.

By ugly, I mean that powerpc, perf, and buddy hardlockup detectors
make watchdog_hardlockup_probe() successful by implementing
an alternative to the default weak implementation. Only, sparc64
reports success via a crazy check in the default weak configuration.

The check is crazy because it makes the decision based on
CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG. But the related code is in
arch/sparc/kernel/nmi.c which is compiled when CONFIG_SPARC64
is enabled.

The connection between CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG and
CONFIG_SPARC64 is hidden in arch/sparc/Kconfig.

It would be much more straightforward when the weak function
is implemented in arch/sparc/kernel/nmi.c. It will be clear
that probe() will succeed when the watchdog gets initialized.

Yeah, it seems that this bug was there. And it will get fixed when
the default weak implementation of watchdog_hardlockup_probe()
always returns false.

Again, I'll let Andrew to decide whether this should get cleaned
in this patchset or later. But it would be fine to fix this
after we spent so much time understanding the mess.

Petr
