The RMM (not included in this particular series[1]) sets the first
element of the 'GPRS' array which is in memory shared with the host.

The Linux half to populate the vcpu structure is in the previous patch:

+static int rec_exit_sync_dabt(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
+{
+	struct rec *rec = &vcpu->arch.rec;
+
+	if (kvm_vcpu_dabt_iswrite(vcpu) && kvm_vcpu_dabt_isvalid(vcpu))
+		vcpu_set_reg(vcpu, kvm_vcpu_dabt_get_rd(vcpu),
+			     rec->run->exit.gprs[0]);
+
+	return kvm_handle_guest_abort(vcpu);
+}

I guess it might make sense to pull the 'if' statement out of the
previous patch and into this one to keep all the MMIO code together.

[1] This Linux code is written against the RMM specification and in
theory could work with any RMM implementation. But the TF RMM is open
source, so I can point you at the assignment in the latest commit here:
https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-RMM/tf-rmm.git/tree/runtime/core/exit.c?id=d294b1b05e8d234d32684a982552aa2a17fb9157#n264
