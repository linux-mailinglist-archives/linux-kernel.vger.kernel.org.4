Per the internal discussion, there is no need to explicitly callout 
CR4[28] can be set out side of 64-bit mode in SDM/LAM spec for the 
following reasons:

According to SDM Vol.2 Move to/from Control Registers:
- "On a 64-bit capable processor, an execution of MOV to CR outside of 
64-bit mode zeros the upper 32 bits of the control register."
   It doesn't mention of clearing any of the lower bits.

- "Some of the bits in CR0, CR3, and CR4 are reserved and must be 
written with zeros. ...  Attempting to set any reserved bits in CR4 
results in #GP(0)"
   CR4[28] is not reserved on processors that support LAM, and SDM / LAM 
spec doesn't explicitly say the bit cannot be set under some specific 
condition.

So just like the reset of CR4[31:0], CR4[28] can be set by any 32-bit 
load of CR4 when LAM is supported.
For example, CR4[17] is used only with 64-bit paging, but it can be set 
by a 32-bit load of CR4 when 32-bit paging or PAE paging is in use.
Similarly, user-interrupt delivery is enabled by setting CR4[25]. It can 
be set in any mode, even though user-interrupt delivery can occur only 
in 64-bit mode.
