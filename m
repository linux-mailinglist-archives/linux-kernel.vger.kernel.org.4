Hello Jakub, I'm looking into device memory (peer-to-peer) networking
actually, and I plan to pursue using the page pool as a front end.

Quick description of what I have so far:
current implementation uses device memory with struct pages; I am
putting all those pages in a gen_pool, and we have written an
allocator that allocates pages from the gen_pool. In the driver, we
use this allocator instead of alloc_page() (the driver in question is
gve which currently doesn't use the page pool). When the driver is
done with the p2p page, it simply decrements the refcount on it and
the page is freed back to the gen_pool.

Test results are good; our best results we're able to achieve ~96%
line rate with incoming packets going straight to device memory and
without bouncing the memory to a host buffer (albeit these results are
on our slighly older, production LTS, I need to work on getting
results from linus/master).

I've discussed your page pool frontend idea with our gve owners and
the idea is attractive. In particular it would be good not to insert
much custom code into the driver to support device memory pages or
other page types. I plan on trying to change my approach to match the
page pool provider you have in progress here:
https://github.com/kuba-moo/linux/tree/pp-providers

In particular the main challenge right now seems to be that my device
memory pages are ZONE_DEVICE pages, which can't be inserted to the
page pool as-is due to the union in struct page between the page pool
entries and the ZONE_DEVICE entries. I have some ideas on how to work
around that I'm looking into.

It sounds like you don't have the time at the moment to work on the
page pool provider idea; I plan to try and get my code working with
that model and propose it if it's successful. Let me know if you have
concerns here.
