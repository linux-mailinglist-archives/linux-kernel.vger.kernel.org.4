The data do not make sense to me. My new code is executed AFTER pcie
link up/down determination.  Both test results should have the same
link status -- either "link up" or "link down".

If the system is wishy-washy, i.e. it has link-up in 5/10 boots, then
we need to repeat  the experiment to compare the "link up" cases only.
Or discount the test completely

If the system is not wishy-washy, then something has been changed
between the "before" and "after"  tests.
