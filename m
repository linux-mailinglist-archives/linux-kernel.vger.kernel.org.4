It's intermittent, but happens on both v5.10 and v6.1.15.  So we have
no reason to think this is a regression, right?

And you see it on ADL and RPL?  Do you see it on any other platforms?
Have you tried any others?

How exactly did you use setpci and what was "<garbage>"?  Can you
include the entire transcript, e.g.,

  $ setpci -G -s 01:00.0 BASE_ADDRESS_0.L
  Trying method linux-sysfs......using /sys/bus/pci...OK
  Decided to use linux-sysfs
  ec000000

What does "lspci -vvxxx" show in this case?

I guess "kernel PCI resource-0: 0x83000000" means the following from
your dmesg log, right?

  pci 0000:03:00.0: BAR 0: assigned [mem 0x83000000-0x83003fff 64bit]

I think the first access to the device should be here (same as what
Keith said):

  nvme_probe
    nvme_pci_enable
      pci_enable_device_mem
      pci_set_master
      readl(dev->bar + NVME_REG_CSTS)

But you mention nvme_reset_work() above.  How did you figure that out?

Maybe there's a race where we reset the device (which clears the BARs)
and do MMIO accesses before the BARs are restored.

Or maybe some PCI error happens and nvme_reset_work() is invoked as
part of recovery?  I see some *corrected* AER errors in your log, but
none look related to your NVMe device at 03:00.0.

I assume reading the BAR with setpci happens in "slow user time" so we
have to assume that's the steady state of the BAR after nvme_probe()
fails with -19.
