That and a fairly deep seated loathing for the regular CFI annotations
and DWARF in general. Linus was fairly firm he didn't want anything to
do with DWARF for in-kernel unwinding.

That left us in a spot that we needed unwind information in a 'better'
format than DWARF.

Objtool was born out of those contraints. ORC not needing the CFI
annotations and ORC being *much* faster at unwiding and generation
(debug builds are slow) were all good.
