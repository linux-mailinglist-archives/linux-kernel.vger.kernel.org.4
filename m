Hello, Thank you for testing the driver and commenting, I'll incorporate your
suggestions in the next version of this series.

This patch alone does not make the driver work. Without the fixes to the
address windows and translation found in [PATCH v2 6/9] ("PCI: rockchip:
Fix window mapping and address translation for endpoint") transfers will not
work. However, as you said, with the patch series, the driver works.
Good to see that you have the driver working on the rockpro64 which is a
very similar but different board than the one I used (FriendlyElec NanoPC-T4).

No, the bug is not in the TRM:
The RK3399 PCIe endpoint core has the physical address space of 64MB
@ 0xF800'0000 to access the PCIe address space (TRM 17.5.4).
This space is split into 33 windows, one of 32MBytes and 32 of 1MByte.
Read-write accesses by the CPU to that region will be translated. Each
window has a mapping that is configured through the ATR Configuration
Register Address Map (TRM 17.6.8) and the registers addr0 and addr1
will dictate the translation between the window (a physical CPU addr)
into a PCI space address (with this the unit can translate). The other
registers are for the PCIe header descriptor.
The translation process is documented in TRM 17.5.5.1.1
The core will translate all read-write accesses to the windows that fall
in the 64MB space @ 0xF800'0000 and generate the PCIe addresses
and headers according to the values in the registers in the ATR
Configuration Register Address Map (@ 0xFDC0'0000).

Translation does indeed take place and works
but requires the changes in [PATCH v2 6/9] ("PCI: rockchip:
Fix window mapping and address translation for endpoint")
because it was broken from the start...

The two writes that were removed are to unused (read-only) registers.
The writes don't do anything, manually writing and reading back these
addresses will always lead to 0 (they are read-only). So they are removed.
