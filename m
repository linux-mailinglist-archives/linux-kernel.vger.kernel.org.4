We really should. The above combination of error masks seems pretty 
arbitrary, as actually you do _not_ want to check for there error mask, 
but rather for the fact that the sense code is bogus.
So shouldn't we rather test for that one directly?

Yes. We should rather return a DID_RESET status instead of any made up 
sense code for which we don't have a good justification, and which might 
get invalidated by future SATL versions.
