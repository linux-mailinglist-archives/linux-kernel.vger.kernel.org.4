I don't think so.

I haven't dig into the bug yet. But from the source code I can tell that
the check is the same as the current 6.3-rc7.

For the current 6.3-rc7, perf stat true works.
The perf stat -M TopdownL1 --metric-no-group can work as well.

But with the current perf-tools-next branch, perf stat true gives a
Segmentation fault.

The TopdownL1 doesn't work either.

# ./perf stat -M TopdownL1 --metric-no-group
Error:
The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 22 (Invalid argument)
for event (topdown-retiring).
/bin/dmesg | grep -i perf may provide additional information.

I have pointed out many issues (crash, missing features, user-visible
changes which breaking existing tools) many times in the previous reply,
I will not repeat the details again here.

The json metrics in the current perf-tools-next branch which you want to
switch to also has many bugs based on my recent test.
- The TopdownL2 triggers unnecessary multiplexing on SPR.
- Doesn't work on hybrid platforms while the current 6.3-rc7 can.

The difference between the hard coded kernel metrics and the json
metrics is that the json metrics just collect two more events, e.g., on
Tigerlake. The core metrics is exactly the same. It's good enough for a
initial judgement with core metrics.

I don't think the switching is a good choice and necessary based on all
of the above issues.

Thanks,
Kan
