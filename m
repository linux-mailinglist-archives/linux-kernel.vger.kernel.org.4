I think it is better to name after one of the board type among all its
supported types. At least it clearly indicates they are related to board
type.

Actually it is normal for many driver modules. A driver was initially
implemented for one board type, and was named by the initial board.
But later you have more board types compatible to the driver, you don't
change the driver name, just use it.
