Thanks for the review. I have some thoughts about reliable stacktrace.

If PC is not in the range of literal_call, stacktrace works as before without
changes.

If PC is in the range of literal_call, for example, interrupted by an
irq, I think there are 2 problems:

1. Caller LR is not pushed to the stack yet, so caller's address and name
    will be missing from the backtrace.

2. Since PC is not in func's address range, no symbol name will be found, so
    func name is also missing.

Problem 1 is not introduced by this patchset, but the occurring probability
may be increased by this patchset. I think this problem should be addressed by
a reliable stacktrace scheme, such as ORC on x86.

Problem 2 is indeed introduced by this patchset. I think there are at least 3
ways to deal with it:

1. Add a symbol name for literal_call.

2. Hack the backtrace routine, if no symbol name found for a PC during backtrace,
    we can check if the PC is in literal_call, then adjust PC and try again.

3. Move literal_call to the func's address range, for example:

         a. Compile with -fpatchable-function-entry=7
         func:
                 BTI C
                 NOP
                 NOP
                 NOP
                 NOP
                 NOP
                 NOP
                 NOP
         func_body:
                 ...


         b. When disabled, patch it to
         func:
                 BTI C
                 B func_body
         literal:
                 .quad dummy_tramp
         literal_call:
                 LDR X16, literal
                 MOV X9, LR
                 BLR X16
         func_body:
                 ...


         c. When enabled and target is out-of-range, patch it to
         func:
                 BTI C
                 B literal_call
         literal:
                 .quad custom_trampoline
         literal_call:
                 LDR X16, literal
                 MOV X9, LR
                 BLR X16
         func_body:
                 ...


         d. When enabled and target is in range, patch it to
         func:
                 BTI C
                 B direct_call
         literal:
                 .quad dummy_tramp
                 LDR X16, literal
         direct_call:
                 MOV X9, LR
                 BL custom_trampoline
         func_body:
                 ...
