I see what you mean now. will do.

No worries at all. I appreciate you directly telling me how you prefer
it to be done, and that makes the job easier for both of us. Please do
bear with me though, because I'm very unfamiliar with the KVM side of
expectations.

Agreed.

Will do.

Sorry, I don't understand. You mean clear_bit() on a huge PTE is
technically wrong? Yes, that's what I mean. (cmpxchg() on a huge PTE
is not.)

I think there is a misunderstanding here. Let me be more specific:
1. Clearing the A-bit in a non-leaf entry is technically wrong because
that's not our intention.
2. When we try to clear_bit() on a leaf PMD, it can at the same time
become a non-leaf PMD, which causes 1) above, and therefore is
technically wrong.
3. I don't think 2) could do any real harm, so no practically no problem.
4. cmpxchg() can avoid 2).

Does this make sense?

Thanks.
