Is this difference really important from the OOM POV. There is no group
oom semantic in v1 and so it always boils down to a specific process
that gets selected. Which memcg it is sitting in shouldn't matter all
that much. Or does it really matter?

Generally speaking oom report is not carved into stone. While we
shouldn't make changes just nilly willy it might change for
implementation specific reasons.

In this particular case I would agree that the new output is more
confusing than helpful. Just look at

These stats are actively misleading because it would suggest there was
no memory reclaim done before oom was hit and that would imply a
potentially premature OOM killer invocation (thus a bug). There are
likely other stats which are not tracked in v1 yet they are reported
that might add to the confusion. I believe this would be a sound
justification to get back to the original reporting.
