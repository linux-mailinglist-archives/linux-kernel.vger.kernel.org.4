From the point of view of the endpoint driver, ASPM should be
invisible -- no software intervention required.  I think you're
suggesting that the PCIe controller driver could help exit L1.x by
handling a clk req interrupt and enabling clock and PHY then.

But doesn't L1.x exit also have to happen within the time the endpoint
can tolerate?  E.g., I think L1.2 exit has to happen within the LTR
time advertised by the endpoint (PCIe r6.0, sec 5.5.5).  How can we
guarantee that if software is involved?
