My apologies again for the silly mistakes and having to send multiple
versions of the patch set.

Well, it's a nonzero offset from task. But yes, to your point, it's a
misleading comment because the offset is 0 in the verifier. I'll
rephrase this to reflect that it's a nested pointer (or a walked
pointer, whatever nomenclature we end up going with).

Ah, yeah, it makes sense that some kfuncs really should only ever be
passed an object if the program owns a reference on it. Specifically for
e.g. bpf_ct_set_timeout/status() as you point out, which should only be
passed a struct nf_conn__init that was allocated by bpf_skb_ct_alloc().

It'd be nice if we could just add another flag like KF_REFERENCED_ARGS
or KF_OWNED_ARGS, which would allow a subset of arguments affored by
KF_TRUSTED_ARGS, only those with ref_obj_id > 0. That approach wouldn't
allow the flexibility of having per-argument specifications as your
proposal to use __ref or __owned suffixes on the names, but that already
applies to KF_TRUSTED_ARGS as well.

Personally I'm in agreement with Alexei that it's not a user friendly
API to use suffixes in the name like this. If we want to allow kfunc
authors to have per-argument specifiers, using compiler attributes
and/or some kind of tagging is probably the way to do it?

My proposal for now is to add a new KF_OWNED_ARGS flag, and to very
clearly document exactly what that and KF_TRUSTED_ARGS implies for
kfuncs. Later on, we could explore solutions for having per-arg
specifiers. What do you and Alexei think?
