The bluetooth device (realtek,rtl8723bs-bt) never appears, apparently
because the UART it's attached to never loads - it doesn't even try to
load the firmware.

I originally tried on 6.1.21, which is where I got the "Failed to create
device link" message. I then moved to 6.3-rc7 as I saw there had been
further changes recently. There I just get the:

serial serial0-0: deferred probe pending

message.

I have the following in my device tree:

&uart3 {
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&uart3_pg_pins>,
                    <&uart3_cts_rts_pg_pins>;
        status = "okay";

        bluetooth {
                compatible = "realtek,rtl8723bs-bt";
                device-wake-gpios = <&axp_gpio 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
                host-wake-gpios = <&pio 1 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PB3 */
        };
};

uart3 is a snps,dw-apb-uart, defined in arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i.dtsi

The UART and AXP209 device drivers are compiled into the kernel:

CONFIG_PINCTRL_AXP209=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_DW=y

The bluetooth bits are modules (btrtl, hci_uart).

If I remove the device-wake-gpios line then the Bluetooth device works
fine, and /sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred is empty.

Somehow it seems like the GPIO is being parsed as a dependency for the
serial port, even though the serial port + GPIO are both dependencies
for the bluetooth device. Even with that, given both are built-in I
don't understand why the serial port never completes setup.

When I say it's optional I mean if it's not listed everything works
fine, but I don't believe there's anyway to express that in the DTS.
It's certainly not required for the serial port, just the bluetooth
device.
