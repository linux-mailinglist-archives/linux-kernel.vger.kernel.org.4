Clearing ARI Forwarding Enable sounds reasonable, but I don't see
why all the other bits in the Device Control 2 register need to be
cleared.  If there isn't a reason to clear them, I'd be in favor of
leaving them alone.

As for clearing ARI Forwarding Enable, it seems commit b0cc6020e1cc
("PCI: Enable ARI if dev and upstream bridge support it; disable
otherwise") already solved this problem.  Quoth its commit message:

   "Currently, we enable ARI in a device's upstream bridge if the bridge and
    the device support it.  But we never disable ARI, even if the device is
    removed and replaced with a device that doesn't support ARI.
    
    This means that if we hot-remove an ARI device and replace it with a
    non-ARI multi-function device, we find only function 0 of the new device
    because the upstream bridge still has ARI enabled, and next_ari_fn()
    only returns function 0 for the new non-ARI device.
    
    This patch disables ARI in the upstream bridge if the device doesn't
    support ARI.  See the PCIe spec, r3.0, sec 6.13."

My superficial understanding of that patch is that we do find function 0,
while enumerating it we clear the ARI Forwarding Enable bit and thus the
remaining functions become accessible and are subsequently enumerated.

Are you seeing issues when removing an ARI-capable endpoint from a
hotplug slot and replacing it with a non-ARI-capable device?
If you do, the question is why the above-quoted commit doesn't avoid them.

This clears the Device Control 2 register on the hotplugged device,
but to clear ARI Forwarding Enable, you'd have to clear the register
of the hotplug port, i.e. the *parent* of the hotplugged device.

Also, this patch doesn't apply cleanly to v6.4-rc1 because of a context
change by f5eff5591b8f ("PCI: pciehp: Fix AB-BA deadlock between
reset_lock and device_lock").

Thanks,

Lukas
