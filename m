Well, ok. I guess Paul's point was that it is better to write code in
the kernel to be sure, than running in this kind of risk. Maybe for
certain workloads, it is a much better choice.

For example, if the trustworthy UMD had the task to extract the crypto
material from X.509 certificates an PKCS#7 signatures, and pass it to
the kernel, breaking the isolation almost certainly would mean that the
kernel accepts more kernel modules than it should.

The question would be, if we restrict the scope of data processed by
trustworthy UMDs, would that make the solution more acceptable?

An idea for example would be: if we do appraisal with the traditional
methods (signature in the xattr, HMAC, etc.) the trustworthy UMD would
not have any impact.

Only if the IMA policy says, allow appraisal based on what the
trustworthy UMD provides, maybe it is ok? (Mimi?)

Thanks
