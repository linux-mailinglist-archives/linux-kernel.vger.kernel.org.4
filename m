The latter resulting in the former. If for BROKENKEY 32 bytes were 
specified, a brute force attacker knowing the key properties would only 
need to try at most 2^(16*8) keys, as if the key was only 16 bytes long. 
This is what I mean with "effective size" in contrast to the key's byte 
size which is 32 in my example.

The security issue is a result of the combination of limiting the input 
range to hex-ascii and using memcpy() instead of hex2bin(). It could have 
been fixed either by allowing binary input or using hex2bin() (and 
doubling the ascii input key length). I chose the latter.
