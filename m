I don't know exactly what the panic looks like, but I wouldn't expect
UR handling to be different when there's a switch.

pcie-rockchip-host.c does handle devices on the root bus (00)
differently than others because rockchip_pcie_valid_device() knows
that device 00:00 is the only device on the root bus.  That part makes
sense because 00:00 is built into the SoC.

I'm a little suspicious of the fact that rockchip_pcie_valid_device()
also enforces that bus 01 can only have a single device on it.  No
other *_pcie_valid_device() implementations enforce that.  It's true
that traditional PCIe devices can only implement device 00, but ARI
relaxes that by reusing the Device Number as extended Function Number
bits.
