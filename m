It's a bit difficult to insert a PCIe logic analyzer on someone else's
soldered down parts. Intel is the only party with all the HW in a form
that allows that level of debugging.

Of course! But note that spamming the logs with low priority messages
isn't acceptable either. So we should be doing both.

Rajat (from Intel) has told me that Intel is investigating this.

I was told the devices are reporting two kinds of correctable
errors:replay rollover and replay timeout.

This may be related to a replay timer value (PCIERTP1) in the PCI
device is too short for PCIe tunneling (USB4).  It's not clear to me
if this value is hardcoded in the Intel NIC or if it's configurable.
But I've been waiting since last December for Intel to give me
guidance on what is implemented in their NIC.

True. I'm not sure why I thought KERN_INFO would not show up.  If they
do, I'll depend on the rate limiting patch to not spam the system
logs.

I don't think there is. Rajat previously mentioned this was for the HP
TBT4 docking station. The two USB4 docking station vendors I'm
familiar with are both using Intel i225 NIC (foxville). This appears
to be a problem only with the NIC behind a PCIe tunnel and not a HW
problem with the docking station overall (which is what I previously
assumed.)

FTR, this same NIC works and does not report correctable errors when
directly connected to a PCI host controller. It's not as happy on the
other side of a USB4 PCIe tunnel but still appears to work correctly
(retries are succeeding). I'm not able to point at any NIC failures
(yet). But I'm certainly not very happy that the same company which is
the primary backer of thunderbolt and USB4 isn't able to
design/configure parts so they play well together.

Yup - that's exactly how I've been helped so often in the past as well.

Not intentionally - but Yes - the next patch is simpler when changing
to pci_info_ratelimit. This change will show up in either the first or
second patch.

I can switch that hunk back to V1 code if you prefer that for this patch.
