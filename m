OK.

I agree it adds some complexity. The benefit is to allow shipping a kernel with
a good default where KVM users with non-vulnerable CPUs get low latency out
of the box (vs. having to figure out if they are vulnerable or not and changing
a run-time configuration).

But the idea would be to set "never" by default as long as the CPU is not vulnerable.

This would work too :)
