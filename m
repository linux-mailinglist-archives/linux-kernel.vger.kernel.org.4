The dpc driver can react to a DPC event, attempt reset recovery.

But it doesn't do de-enumeration or re-enumeration of subordinate devices.
It also doesn't do slot handling (enable/disable Power Controller etc).
That's only implemented in the hotplug driver.

PCIe r6.0.1 contains appendix I.2 which basically suggests to "use DPC"
for async hot-plug but that doesn't really seem to make sense.

In principle, yes.  Actually the hotplug driver will see both a DLLSC
*and* a PDC event and will react to whichever comes first.  Experience
has shown that the two events may occur in arbitrary order and with
significant delays in-between.

There are systems which erroneously hardwire Presence Detect to zero.
The hotplug driver works even with those.  It solely relies on the
DLLSC event then, see commit 80696f991424 ("PCI: pciehp: Tolerate
Presence Detect hardwired to zero").

The latter approach doesn't really make sense to me because we'd have to
duplicate all the slot handling and device de-/re-enumeration in the dpc
driver.

Let's try masking Surprise Down Errors first and see how that goes.

Thanks,
