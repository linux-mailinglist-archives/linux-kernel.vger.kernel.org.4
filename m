Hi Bjorn,

Sorry for the delay. I'm just back from an extended leave.

It's mentioned as an explanation for why the patch also programs LTR values.

Well it affects Rocket Lake, Tiger Lake, and Alder Lake. It partially affects
Raptor Lake because we were able to have BIOS implement a solution to program
the LTR values. The plan is to use the same method to also program ASPM by
Meteor Lake and future products. So we do intend this to be a quirk for current
platforms, not a permanent solution.

An expansion switch added between the root port and the downstream device.

I understand that they can be hot-pluggable. But the focus of the patch is to
address high power consumption on laptop systems since this is where we have
bugs reported. I don't know that it's worth the effort to make this work with
hot-plug.

Looking at the spec (and at current DSDTs) it looks like that _DSM can be used
for exactly this purpose. However, proper VMD ACPI support is yet another
headache for Linux. The AML exists, but uses a different addressing scheme in
order to hide the devices from normal enumeration. Because of this, there are no
ACPI companion devices associated with the PCI devices.
