We need to be careful about a stack overflow. I have seen that
KSYM_NAME_LEN might need to be increased to 512 because of
Rust support, see
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220805154231.31257-6-ojeda@kernel.org

Good point! I agree that the potential extra overhead is negligible
when using the old code as a fallback.
