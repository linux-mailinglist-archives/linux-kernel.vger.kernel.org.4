Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. As many (most?)
kernel developers don't keep an eye on it, I decided to forward it by
mail (note, the reporter *is not* CCed to this mail, see[1]).

Christoph, apparently it's caused by a commit of yours.

[TLDR for the rest of this mail: I'm adding this report to the list of
tracked Linux kernel regressions; the text you find below is based on a
few templates paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar
form.]

BTW, let me use this mail to also add the report to the list of tracked
regressions to ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks:

#regzbot introduced: 78013eaadf696d21
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217218
#regzbot title: dma/x86: machine with Marvell SATA controller 88SE9235
stopped booting
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (e.g. the buzgzilla ticket and maybe this mail as well, if
this thread sees some discussion). See page linked in footer for details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.
