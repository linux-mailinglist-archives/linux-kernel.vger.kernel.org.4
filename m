Your guess is correct.  UEFI world is moving to being stricter, for
example set page permissions according to the allocation type (RW for
data, RX for code).

Microsoft raised the bar for PE binaries when it comes to secure boot
signing as part of that effort.  Being a valid PE binary according to
the PE spec is not good enough, some additional constrains like sections
not overlapping and sections with different load flags not sharing pages
(so setting strict page permissions is actually possible) are required
now.  Stuff which is standard since years elsewhere.

That too.

Agree.

I don't expect much problems here.  Early EFI implementations don't
bother setting page permissions and just identity-map everything using
rwx huge pages, or run with paging turned off (hello ia32).

But playing safe (and keep demand-faulting just in case) is a good idea
nevertheless.

take care,
  Gerd
