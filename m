Thanks for the analysis, I did feel the samples were few. I am happy to
update it with more data if Qiuxu can collect more samples and provide.

Yes, it can be extended because once the default timer fires, it will
schedule a new timer to account for that. Thanks, I'll clarify in the above
docs.

Good point, it is from the start of boot always, I fixed it.

True, but actually I realize I don't even need to do it because I overwrite
it in the next step ;-). So I'll just remove it.

You are quite right, sorry to miss it. To prevent this sort of issue
happening again, I moved the locking to the caller which also simplifies the
code a bit and prevents such traps.

No it is not necessary, as we can keep the older timer and once it fires, its
callback will call rcu_end_inkernel_boot() which will queue another timer to
extend the delay further. As long as 'rcu_boot_end_delay' is updated, it will
work fine. You can see that in test #3 below.

Actually this part of the code is equivalent to what I had in my first
patch, so it is not any new code I am adding.

I prefer to keep it this way as with this method, I can not only get to
have variable rcu_boot_end_delay via boot parameter (as in my first patch), I
also don't need to add a separate sysfs entry, and can just reuse
'rcu_boot_end_delay' parameter, which I also had in my first patch. And
adding yet another sysfs parameter will actually complicate it even more and
add more lines of code.

I tested difference scenarios and it works fine, though I missed that
mutex locking unfortunately, I did verify different test cases work as
expected by manual testing.

Here are some printks and on simple testing in Qemu:

1. End the boot early, CONFIG is set to 120 seconds:
==================================================
[    1.614968] rcu_boot_end_delay = 120000
[    1.617630] schedule delayed work joel

Boot took 1.57 seconds
root@(none):/# cat /sys/module/rcupdate/parameters/rcu_boot_end_delay
120000
root@(none):/#
root@(none):/#
root@(none):/# echo 0 > /sys/module/rcupdate/parameters/rcu_boot_end_delay
[   10.108394] param called joel
[   10.110520] sys calling boot ended
[   10.112730] rcu_boot_end_delay = 0
[   10.115017] boot ended joel
-----------------------------------------------

2. End the boot passing in rcupdate.rcu_boot_end_delay as 10s.
   This should overwride the CONFIG of 120 seconds:
==================================================
[    1.700090] rcu_boot_end_delay = 10000
[    1.702628] schedule delayed work joel

Boot took 1.64 seconds

root@(none):/# [   10.414008] rcu_boot_end_delay = 10000
[   10.416670] boot ended joel
-----------------------------------------------

3. Do the same thing as #2, but extend the boot via sysfs to be longer than
10 seconds:
==================================================
[    0.060025] param called joel
[    0.060026] param called too early joel
[    1.663905] rcu_boot_end_delay = 10000
[    1.667051] schedule delayed work joel

Boot took 1.61 seconds

root@(none):/#
root@(none):/# echo 20000 > /sys/module/rcupdate/parameters/rcu_boot_end_delay
[    6.932517] param called joel
[    6.934637] sys calling boot ended
[    6.936845] rcu_boot_end_delay = 20000
[    6.939291] schedule delayed work joel
root@(none):/# [   10.389366] rcu_boot_end_delay = 20000
[   10.392047] schedule delayed work joel
[   20.117416] rcu_boot_end_delay = 20000
[   20.120073] boot ended joel
-----------------------------------------------

The debug patch is here: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jfern/linux.git/commit/?h=rcu/lazy/postboot

Appended is the updated v4 patch, tested as shown above, more testing is in progress.

thanks,

Subject: [PATCH v4] rcu: Add a minimum time for marking boot as completed

On many systems, a great deal of boot (in userspace) happens after the
kernel thinks the boot has completed. It is difficult to determine if
the system has really booted from the kernel side. Some features like
lazy-RCU can risk slowing down boot time if, say, a callback has been
added that the boot synchronously depends on. Further expedited callbacks
can get unexpedited way earlier than it should be, thus slowing down
boot (as shown in the data below).

For these reasons, this commit adds a config option
'CONFIG_RCU_BOOT_END_DELAY' and a boot parameter rcupdate.boot_end_delay.
Userspace can also make RCU's view of the system as booted, by writing the
time in milliseconds to: /sys/module/rcupdate/parameters/rcu_boot_end_delay
Or even just writing a value of 0 to this sysfs node.
However, under no circumstance will the boot be allowed to end earlier
than just before init is launched.

The default value of CONFIG_RCU_BOOT_END_DELAY is chosen as 15s. This
suites ChromeOS and also a PREEMPT_RT system below very well, which need
no config or parameter changes, and just a simple application of this patch. A
system designer can also choose a specific value here to keep RCU from marking
boot completion.  As noted earlier, RCU's perspective of the system as booted
will not be marker until at least rcu_boot_end_delay milliseconds have passed
or an update is made via writing a small value (or 0) in milliseconds to:
/sys/module/rcupdate/parameters/rcu_boot_end_delay.

One side-effect of this patch is, there is a risk that a real-time workload
launched just after the kernel boots will suffer interruptions due to expedited
RCU, which previous ended just before init was launched. However, to mitigate
such an issue (however unlikely), the user should either tune
CONFIG_RCU_BOOT_END_DELAY to a smaller value than 15 seconds or write a value
of 0 to /sys/module/rcupdate/parameters/rcu_boot_end_delay, once userspace
boots, and before launching the real-time workload.

Qiuxu also noted impressive boot-time improvements with earlier version
of patch. An excerpt from the data he shared:

1) Testing environment:
    OS            : CentOS Stream 8 (non-RT OS)
    Kernel     : v6.2
    Machine : Intel Cascade Lake server (2 sockets, each with 44 logical threads)
    Qemu  args  : -cpu host -enable-kvm, -smp 88,threads=2,sockets=2, â€¦

2) OS boot time definition:
    The time from the start of the kernel boot to the shell command line
    prompt is shown from the console. [ Different people may have
    different OS boot time definitions. ]

3) Measurement method (very rough method):
    A timer in the kernel periodically prints the boot time every 100ms.
    As soon as the shell command line prompt is shown from the console,
    we record the boot time printed by the timer, then the printed boot
    time is the OS boot time.

4) Measured OS boot time (in seconds)
   a) Measured 10 times w/o this patch:
        8.7s, 8.4s, 8.6s, 8.2s, 9.0s, 8.7s, 8.8s, 9.3s, 8.8s, 8.3s
        The average OS boot time was: ~8.7s

   b) Measure 10 times w/ this patch:
        8.5s, 8.2s, 7.6s, 8.2s, 8.7s, 8.2s, 7.8s, 8.2s, 9.3s, 8.4s
        The average OS boot time was: ~8.3s.
