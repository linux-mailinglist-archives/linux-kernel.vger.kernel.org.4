Agree. A reg->type with both PTR_TRUSTED and PTR_UNTRUSTED would be a bug,
but let's fix it when we get there.
Even if such bug hits us we can protect from it by make sure that
we treat PTR_UNTRUSTED as logically stronger flag.

exactly.

sure. we can do that in the follow up.
A bit more technical debt to address later.

Perfect. Looking forward.
