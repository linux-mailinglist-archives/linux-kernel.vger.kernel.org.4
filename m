If it is so common you should be able to reproduce the issue and give 
numbers. At this point, what I read is "that may happen because I2C is 
slow and we may monitor it at an insane rate, so let's cache the value".

No, the core code has not to be defensive against bad hardware design.

If multiple processes are reading in an infinite loop the temperature, 
they will constantly take the lock, and as the monitoring thread is a 
CFS task, this one will be considered as the readers and be delayed, 
with probably a mitigation temperature drift. Here we have a missing 
defensive / optimized code against a DoS but it is unrelated to the 
hardware and the fix is not caching the value.

Yes, and ?

That is what I said, the hwmon and the thermal zone are connected.

I'm not saying it is illogical. I'm pointing the slow drivers are under 
hwmon subsystems and usually don't aim in-kernel mitigation. The 
get_temp ops is going through hwmon and the drivers may cache the 
values. So *if* there is an in-kernel mitigation, the value will be 
already cached usually.

I do believe I raised some valid concerns regarding the approach. Could 
please take them into account instead of eluding them?

1. A real use case with temperature limit drift (easy to reproduce 
because it is very common)

2. How about the consistency between hwmon and thermal? (one driver but 
two ways to access the temperature - one may cache and the other not)

Another question regarding the I2C example, if another subsystem is 
using the I2C, won't it take the bus lock and create the contention 
also? I mean it is possible to create a mitigation drift by reading 
constantly another sensor value (eg. voltage or whatever) ?
