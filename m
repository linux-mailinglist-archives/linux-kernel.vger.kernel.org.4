An iommu driver.  So maybe you want to use virtio iommu then?

A memory controller driver, right? And you need it in a VM? why?

And virtio iommu?

Another memory controller driver? Can we decide on a single one?

How does it remove the problem? You basically get trash from host, no?
But it seems that whether said trash is exploitable will really depend
on how it's used, e.g. if it's an 8 bit value host can just scan all
options in a couple of hundred attempts. What did I miss?

This seems to be assuming drivers check return code from pci config
space accesses, right?  I doubt all drivers do though. Even if they do
that's unlikely to be a well tested path, right?

See above.  I am not sure the argument that the bugs are unexploitable
sits well with the idea that all this effort is improving code quality.
