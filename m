Actuallyï¼Œcommit 1c13d5c08728 ("ext4: Save error information to the 
superblock for analysis")
already merged error info back to the superblock after journal replay 
except 'es->s_state'.
The problem I have now is that the error flag in the journal superblock 
was not recorded,
but the error message was recorded in the superblock. So it leads to 
ext4_clear_journal_err()
does not detect errors and marks the file system as an error. Because 
ext4_update_super() is
only set error flag  when 'sbi->s_add_error_count  > 0'. Although 
'sbi->s_mount_state' is
written to the super block when umount, but it is also conditional.
So I handle the scenario "es->s_error_count && 
!jbd2_journal_errno(journal) &&
!(le16_to_cpu(es->s_state) & EXT4_ERROR_FS)". Maybe we can just store
'EXT4_SB(sb)->s_mount_state & EXT4_ERROR_FS' back to the superblock. But i
prefer to mark fs as error if it contain detail error info without 
EXT4_ERROR_FS.
