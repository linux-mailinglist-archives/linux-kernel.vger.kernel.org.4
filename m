Yes I believe you are correct, there is still an issue here,
indeed a quick test suggests I can still cause this by forcing a
probe defer in the regulator driver.

I think really the best place to look at this would be at the
regulator level. It is fine if mfd_add_devices passes, the problem
really is that the regulator core doesn't realise the regulator is
going to be arriving, and thus returns a dummy regulator, rather
than returning EPROBE_DEFER. If it did the MFD driver would probe
defer at the point of requesting the regulator, which would all
make sense.

I will see if I can find some time to think about that further
but very unlikely to happen this week.

Thanks,
Charles
