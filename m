Well, "is this binary compatible" is a property of the program, yes.
It's up to the loader to decide if it *cares*, and the compatibility
flag allows it to do that.

There has been discussion of implementing a compatibility mode that
allows you to enable NX support by default, but only breaks the old
assumptions that the stack and memory allocations will be executable if
the flag is set, so that newer OSes get the mitigations we need, but
older OSes still work.  I don't think anyone has actually implemented
this *yet*, but some hardware vendors have made noises that sound like
they may intend to.  (I realize that sounds cagey as hell.  Sorry.)

Currently I think the only shipping systems that implement
NX-requirements are from Microsoft - the Surface product line and
Windows Dev Kit - and they don't allow you to disable it at all.  Other
vendors have produced firmware that isn't shipping yet (I *think*) that
has it as a setting in the firmware menu, and they're looking to move to
enabling it by default on some product lines.  We'd like to not be left
behind.

Yeah, the PE spec is not very good in a lot of ways unrelated to how
abominable the thing it's describing is.

Yes, they have, but it's not as if they did it in a vacuum.  I think the
idea was originally Kees Cook's actually, and there's been a significant
effort on the firmware and bootloader side to enable it.  And there's
good reason to do this, too - more and more of this surface is being
attacked, and recently we've seen the first "bootkit" that actually
includes a Secure Boot breakout in the wild: https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/03/01/blacklotus-uefi-bootkit-myth-confirmed/

While that particular malware (somewhat ironically) only uses code
developed for linux systems *after* the exploit, it could easily have
gone the other way, and we're definitely a target here.  We need NX in
our boot path, and soon.

Once we've taken over paging, nothing stops us at all.  Until then,
SetMemoryAttributes() (which is more or less mprotect()) might prevent
it.

I'll let Evgeniy address that and the rest of this.
