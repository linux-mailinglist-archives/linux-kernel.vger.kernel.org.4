In your case:
Default < WP-UNPOPULATE < MADVISE < PRE-READ


In my testing on next-20230228 with this patch and my uffd async patch:

Test DEFAULT: 6
Test PRE-READ: 37157 (pre-fault 37006)
Test MADVISE: 4884 (pre-fault 4465)
Test WP-UNPOPULATE: 17794

DEFAULT < MADVISE < WP-UNPOPULATE < PRE-READ

On my setup, MADVISE is performing better than WP-UNPOPULATE consistently.
I'm not sure why I'm getting this discrepancy here. I've liked your results
to be honest where we perform better with WP-UNPOPULATE than MADVISE. What
can be done to get consistent benchmarks over your and my side?
