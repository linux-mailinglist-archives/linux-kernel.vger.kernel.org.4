I tried various things on top of v6.3 and you are right. My hunks do
not make a (significant) difference there.

So, I took a step back and can only conclude that there must be some
another regression to find, and I was confused by that other regression.
In short, I was on 6.1.<foo> and everything was fine, and then I bumped
to 6.3 and a process crashed. I went to 6.2 and that same process also
crashed. I then totally focused on v6.1..v6.2 to figure out the problem.
I simply assumed v6.3 had the same problem because the symptom from
30.000ft was the same (that process died). I failed to go back to v6.3
to confirm that it was indeed the same problem as I had found in the
v6.1..v6.2 range.

My bad, it seems I have another day of bisections lined up.

Right, the only way pwm_get_state() can be problematic is if bogus values
have made their way into pwm->state earlier. Which is what happened for
v6.2.
