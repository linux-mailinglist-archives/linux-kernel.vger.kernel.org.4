Unless we assert that SHA-1 events are unsupported, it seems a bit odd 
to force a policy on people who have both banks enabled. People with 
mixed fleets are potentially going to be dealing with SHA-1 measurements 
for a while yet, and while there's obviously a security benefit in using 
SHA-2 instead it'd be irritating to have to maintain two attestation 
policies.
