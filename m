Ah, right, of course, thanks for pulling me back out of the weeds!
Yes, I do agree.

An EDR notification is issued on a bus device that is still present,
i.e., a DPC port or parent, but child devices have been disconnected
(ACPI v6.3, sec 5.6.6).

So in edr_handle_event(), pdev is the bus device that receives the
notification, edev is a bus device (possibly the same as pdev, or
possibly a child, but one that is still present), and child devices of
edev have been disconnected.

Prior to 068c29a248b6, pcie_do_recovery(edev) always cleared DEVSTA
for edev.  Afterwards it only clears DEVSTA if the OS owns AER.  This
patch makes edr_handle_event() clear DEVSTA for edev (the Port
device).

I had been looking at the bottom blue OS "Clear error status, ..." box
in the PCI Firmware implementation note, but that's the wrong one.
This is actually the "Clear port error status, bring Port out of DPC,
..." box higher up.  That's clearly before _OST and thus inside the
window.

That box *does* suggest clearing the port error status before bringing
the port out of DPC, and we're doing it in the opposite order:

  edr_handle_event(pdev)
    edev = acpi_dpc_port_get(pdev)
    # Both pdev and edev are present; pdev is same as edev or a
    # parent of edev; children of edev are disconnected
    dpc_process_error(edev)
    pcie_do_recovery(edev, dpc_reset_link)
      if (state == pci_channel_io_frozen)
        dpc_reset_link                  # (reset_subordinates)
          pci_write_config_word(PCI_EXP_DPC_STATUS_TRIGGER) # exit DPC
      if (AER native)
        pcie_clear_device_status(edev)
          clear PCI_EXP_DEVSTA          # doesn't happen
    if (PCI_ERS_RESULT_RECOVERED)
      pcie_clear_device_status
        clear PCI_EXP_DEVSTA            # added by this patch

Does it matter?  I dunno, but I don't *think* so.  We really don't
care about the value of PCI_EXP_DEVSTA anywhere except
pci_wait_for_pending_transaction(), which isn't applicable here.  And
I don't think the fact that it probably has an Error Detected bit set
when exiting DPC is a problem.
