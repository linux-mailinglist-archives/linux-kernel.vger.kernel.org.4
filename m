This is not my process, nor my choice.

It definitely sounds like it.

You missed the point entirely.

The point is that someone contributed a dt-bindings patch that does not
represent the hardware (hence not the driver for that hardware either).
It was taken without objection.  So now what?  We are stuck with a
broken ABI that does not allow us to describe the hardware?

If there are many different drivers and other OSes, why are we solely
responsible for describing broken bindings?  Why were there no
objections elsewhere that this does not allow us to describe the
hardware in question?

Note that the person signing off on and sending that initial dt-bindings
patch for qcom,dispcc-sm6125.yaml is me, by the way.
