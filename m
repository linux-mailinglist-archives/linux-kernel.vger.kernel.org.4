That's not the point.

Why? It's the 'init a new per device domain' code which can rightfully
have a say whether it is willing to support something or not or to put
constraints on it. Those constraints can very much depend on the device
type or the MSI type. Creating random MSI domains seems to be pretty
envogue today and I really have no interest to deal with the fallout
once the fancy muck is merged in some random subsystem and the developer
moved on. I have no idea why everyone thinks that driver writers should
be granted the ultimate freedom to do what they want and anything which
puts an constraint on something is bad and troubled to begin with.

Since I started to strictly encapsulate and fence of things, the amount
of horrors I had to debug and then mop up has significantly decreased.
It also forces people who want to add some new fancy stuff to talk to
the infrastructure people so that the new functionality can be looked at
in the broader picture and solutions can be found upfront and not after
the fact when the resulting damage is discovered.

Quite some of the issues I discovered during last years discussions,
like the VFIO disable/enable trainwreck, the IRQ_VIRTUAL nonsense and
other random hacks could have neen avoided if people would actually talk
to each other and not just run off and hack something into place which
then gets somehow merged.

On the ARM side there is even a fundamental requirement for this today
due to the way how the existing infrastructure handles PCI/MSI[X] and
platform MSI, unless we go and rewrite half of the underlying code first
or in parallel.

It was also a migration aid to catch issues in the gradual conversion.

Again, we are not starting from a clean slate. I might be overly
cautious, but for very good reasons.

Thanks,
