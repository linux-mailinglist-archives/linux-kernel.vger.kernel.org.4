It is not about the sense. It's the rule and the policy. If you want to
change the existing practice, don't do it via one patch that sneaks
something in, but change entire practice for entire DT.

It's not a hardware property. Do not put software choices or policies
specific to only one OS into the DT. The DTS is used by different users,
including other operating systems, firmwares and bootloaders.

Your convenience is not justification for misusing the DT. That's the
same argument community is using since ages for every wish from someone
there wanting something "convenient for him". Same answer for all the
weird ABIs, weird new user-space interfaces, weird duplicated
subsystems, many different schedulers (yeah, because why improve
existing solution in the kernel...) etc. It's always easier for
contributor to solve only their one problem. No, we are less interested
in solving only your one specific problem if such solution breaks
existing rules and consensus.

I think Mark was here quite explicit, but since discussion is still going:

NAK for the linux,rt property.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
