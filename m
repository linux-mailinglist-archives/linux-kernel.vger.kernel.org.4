Indeed. Otherwise, the setup header may not have been copied to memory
by the loader.

You could, but at least the current PE/COFF loader in EDK2 will map it
read/write, as it only distinguishes between executable sections and
non-executable sections.

That was just arbitrary, because the raw allocations of reloc and
compat are also allocated towards the end. But I guess starting at
0x1000 for .reloc makes more sense so feel free to change that.
