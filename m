Actually it is not so hard. What VMMs need to do is:
1. Get host CPUID value.
2. Check if these bits are set.
3. Modify the return value of KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID based on step 2.
4. Pass it to KVM_SET_CPUID2.

If these bits are propagated to guests same as other bits, VMMs can
skip the above process.

VMMs trust to some extent that KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID returns cpuid
information consistent with hardware, although they should not for some
leaves (like CPU topoligy). IMHO, propagating these bits without VMM
actions would be helpful since guests come to know IBRS related
information of processors by default and applies mitigations properly
based on that information.
