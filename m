The best answer is the test results as no one sponsored me a hybrid x86 box.

According to my understanding, when a performance event (e.g. instructions)
is supported on both types of pmu (even with different event codes), perf_event
will remain enabled after the cpu migration (just changing the per-cpu context
based on migrated pmu, and allocating another available hardware counter).

Otherwise, the kernel will or should create and enable the perf_event based on
current pmu type and disable the event of the previous cpu type. For the guest,
KVM will or should recognize the migrated pmu type and enable the currently
available perf_event for guest vPMC.

But on hybrid x86, pmu capabilities are heterogeneous (even though the ISA is
the same), and incompatible migrations can result in previous pmu capabilities
(such as PEBS in this case) not being implemented on the new pmu, which breaks
the expectation of the guest pmu driver.

Making the guest aware of the differences in pmu types requires more fundamental
KVM changes (for example, presenting multiple types of cpu model for the guest),
and perhaps the simple and safe approach is to provide the guest with only the
capabilities that are available to both pmu types.

If things don't happen the way you expect them to, work it out w/ or w/o my help.

The arm64 will have more cpu types (especially in terms of power management),
but the difference in pmu capabilities will also depend on the design of IP vendors.
