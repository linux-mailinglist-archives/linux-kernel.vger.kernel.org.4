I don't really see that a malicious user can exploit anything here,
their irq allocation is bound by the device support and they're
entitled to make use of the full vector set of the device by virtue of
having ownership of the device.  All the MSI-X allocated irqs are freed
when the interrupt mode is changed or the device is released regardless.

The end result is also no different than if the user had not configured
the vector when enabling MSI-X or configured it and later de-configured
with a -1 eventfd.  The irq is allocated but not attached to a ctx.
We're intentionally using this as a cache.

Also, as implemented here in v3, we might be freeing from the original
allocation rather than a new, dynamically allocated irq.

My thinking is that if we think there's a benefit to caching any
allocated irqs, we should do so consistently.  We don't currently know
if the irq was allocated now or previously.  Tracking that would add
complexity for little benefit.  The user can get to the same end result
of an allocated, unused irq in numerous way, the state itself is not
erroneous, and is actually in support of caching irq allocations.
Removing the de-allocation of a single vector further simplifies the
code as there exists only one path where irqs are freed, ie.
pci_free_irq_vectors().

So I'd lean towards removing vfio_msi_free_irq().

There are other means besides caching irqs that could achieve the above,
for instance if a trigger is simply swapped from one eventfd to another,
that all happens within vfio_msi_set_vector_signal() where we could
hold the irq for the transition.

I think I might justify it as:

	The PCI-MSIX API requires that some number of irqs are
	allocated for an initial set of vectors when enabling MSI-X on
	the device.  When dynamic MSIX allocation is not supported, the
	vector table, and thus the allocated irq set can only be resized
	by disabling and re-enabling MSIX with a different range.  In
	that case the irq allocation is essentially a cache for
	configuring vectors within the previously allocated vector
	range.  When dynamic MSIX allocation is supported, the API
	still requires some initial set of irqs to be allocated, but
	also supports allocating and freeing specific irq vectors both
	within and beyond the initially allocated range.

	For consistency between modes, as well as to reduce latency and
	improve reliability of allocations, and also simplicity, this
	implementation only releases irqs via pci_free_irq_vectors()
	when either the interrupt mode changes or the device is
	released.

Does that cover the key points for someone that might want to revisit
this decision later?  Thanks,

Alex
