I think you have answered this above w/ pKVM and I was referring the 
host protection as well w/ Heki. The link/references below refers to the 
Android OS it seems and not guest VM.

Sure. I just hope that they are extensible enough to support for other 
Hypervisors too. I am not sure if they are on this list like ACRN / Xen 
and see if it fits their need too.

Is there any other Hypervisor you plan to test this feature as well?

Yes, if you are using the static kernel only and not considering the 
other dynamic patching features like explained. They need to be thought 
upon differently to reduce the likely impact.

Ah, I was referring the VBS Windows VM mentioned in the above text. Is 
it open-source? The reference of VM (or dedicated VM) didn't mention 
that VM itself will be open-source running Linux kernel.

Thanks. Please share the data once you have it ready.
