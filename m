And here's a v2 with somewhat less code duplication.

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>
Subject: [PATCH] PCI / ACPI: PM: Take _S0W of the target bridge into account in acpi_pci_bridge_d3(()

It is generally questionable to allow a PCI bridge to go into D3 if
it has _S0W returning D2 or a shallower power state, so modify
acpi_pci_bridge_d3(() to always take the return value of _S0W for the
target bridge into accout.  That is, make it return 'false' if _S0W
returns D2 or a shallower power state for the target bridge regardless
of its ancestor PCIe Root Port properties.  Of course, this also causes
'false' to be returned if the PCIe Root Port itself is the target and
its _S0W returns D2 or a shallower power state.

However, still allow bridges without _S0W that are power-manageable via
ACPI to enter D3 to retain the current code behavior in that case.
