So as it is now, we are not tying up a kworker kthread while waiting
for the grace period, correct?  We instead have an RCU callback queued
during that time, and the kworker kthread gets involved only after the
grace period ends.

And #4 changes that, by (sometimes) tying up a kworker kthread for the
full grace period.

I agree that the use of the polled API could be reducing delays, which
is a good thing.  Just being my usual greedy self and asking "Why not
both?", that is use queue_rcu_work() instead of synchronize_rcu() in
conjunction with the polled APIs so as to avoid both the grace-period
delay and the tying up of the kworker kthread.

Or am I missing something here?
