It turns out that cpuset does have a cpuset_fork() method defined and so 
is the legacy freezer even though they don't have a can_fork method. So 
the simplest way to fix this problem is to extend the existing 
cpuset_fork() method to handle the CLONE_INTO_CGROUP case. I have sent 
out an upstream patch to fix that issue.
