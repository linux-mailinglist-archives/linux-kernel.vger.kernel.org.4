should we Cc the next version to linux-api@vger as well just to get a

I think the "may be removed at any time" is a bit odd here. If someone
wants to just remove a kfunc, why bother with the deprecation flag at
all? Besides, that whole "deprecation is optional" bit is explained
below, in this section we're just explaining the flag. So I'd just drop
this bit and combine the first two paragraphs as:

"The KF_DEPRECATED flag is used for kfuncs which are scheduled to be
changed or removed in a subsequent kernel release. A kfunc that is
marked with KF_DEPRECATED should also have any relevant information
captured in its kernel doc. Such information typically includes the
kfunc's expected remaining lifespan, a recommendation for new
functionality that can replace it if any is available, and possibly a
rationale for why it is being removed."

As I said in a previous email, I really don't think encouraging people
to upstream BPF programs are either realistic of desirable. I think we
should drop that and change this point to something like:

b) Unlike regular kernel symbols marked with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, BPF
   programs that call kfuncs are generally not part of the kernel tree.
   This means that refactoring can not generally change callers in-place
   when a kfunc changes, as it is done for e.g. an upstreamed driver being
   updated in place when kernel symbol is changed.

   Unlike with regular kernel symbols, this is expected behaviour for
   BPF symbols, and out-of-tree BPF programs that use kfuncs should be
   considered relevant to discussions and decisions around modifying and
   removing kfuncs. The BPF community will take an active role in
   participating in upstream discussions when necessary to ensure that
   the perspectives of such users are taken into account.

I'd drop the last sentence (from "In other words..."). It's not true
that kfuncs have "the same stability guarantees", we just said above
that out-of-tree BPF programs are relevant. Also, other than that I
don't think having this sentence here adds anything that's not already
explained below, so I'd just drop it and merge the below paragraph into
the above.

reword as: "It's expected that the common case will be that kfuncs will
go through a deprecation period rather than being changed or removed
with not warning. As described in..."

drop "or sometimes earlier if necessary" - the deprecation period ends
when the kfunc is removed, that's what a deprecation period means. If
some factor means that the deprecation period is shortened, that's still
the end of the deprecation period, by definition :)
