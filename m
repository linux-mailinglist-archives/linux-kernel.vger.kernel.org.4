Can I have a brown paper bag, please?  I totally blew it here, and I'm
sorry.

You took my advice by combining this with the existing
cdns_pcie_host_wait_for_link(), but I think my advice was poor because
(a) now this additional wait is not clearly connected with the
erratum, and (b) it affects devices that don't have the erratum.

IIUC, this is all part of a workaround for the i2085 erratum.  The
original workaround, 4740b969aaf5 ("PCI: cadence: Retrain Link to work
around Gen2 training defect"), added this:

  if (!ret && rc->quirk_retrain_flag)
    ret = cdns_pcie_retrain(pcie);

I think the wait for link train to complete should also be in
cdns_pcie_retrain() so it's clearly connected with the quirk, which
also means we'd only do the wait for devices with the erratum.

Which is EXACTLY what your first patch did, and I missed it.  I am
very sorry.  I guess maybe I thought cdns_pcie_retrain() was a
general-purpose thing, but in fact it's only used for this quirk.
