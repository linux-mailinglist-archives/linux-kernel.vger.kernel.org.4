Indeed that seems horribly unclear; personally I reckon something like 
"dw_pcie_200" would be more appropriate. The address is just a 
disambiguator between multiple instances so doesn't need any further 
emphasis, but what is crucial to the user is exactly what kind of PMU it 
is (especially if there's potential for other unrelated PCIe functions 
to start exposing their own different PMUs).

Thanks,
Robin.
