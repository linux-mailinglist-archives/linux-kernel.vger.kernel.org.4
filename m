Hi,

I can confirm that the "Firefox tab crashed" problem with Verneed record 
version mismatch persisted in the
official Ubuntu's 6.0.0-06000 mainline build:

marvin@marvin-IdeaPad-3-15ITL6:~$ uname -rms
Linux 6.0.0-060000-generic x86_64
marvin@marvin-IdeaPad-3-15ITL6:~$ /snap/bin/firefox &
[1] 45245
marvin@marvin-IdeaPad-3-15ITL6:~$ /bin/bash: 
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2: unsupported version 0 of Verdef record
/bin/bash: error while loading shared libraries: 
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2: unsupported version 0 of Verneed record

[1]+  Exit 127                /snap/bin/firefox
marvin@marvin-IdeaPad-3-15ITL6:~$

The build with the Ubuntu's config-5.19.3-051903-generic config file an 
linux_stable 6.0.0 source
is currently in testing. To repeat, it usually took a couple of hours of 
work in Firefox (especially playing Youtube
videos in a tab) before the bug manifested.

Regards,
-mt
