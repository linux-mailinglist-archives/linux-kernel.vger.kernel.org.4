We're talking about the contexts that we now allocate in the xarray to
store the eventfd linkage, right?  We need to pre-allocate some irqs
both to satisfy the API and to support non-dynamic MSI-X devices, but
we don't need to pre-allocate contexts.  The logic that I propose below
supports lookup of the pre-allocated irqs for all cases and falls back
to allocating a new irq only for cases that support it.  irqs and
contexts aren't exactly 1:1 for the dynamic case due to the artifacts
of the API, but the model supports only allocating contexts as they're
used, or "active".

Mostly just trying to illustrate that all interrupt types could be
supported, if it doesn't make sense for INTx, drop it.

Interrupts and contexts allocated together would be ideal, but I think
given the API it's a reasonable and simple compromise given the
non-dynamic support to draw from the initial allocation where we can.
Actually, there could be a latency and reliability advantage to hang on
to the irq when an eventfd is unset, maybe we should only free irqs on
MSI-X teardown and otherwise use the allocated irqs as a cache.  Maybe
worth thinking about.  Thanks,

Alex
