Could you be more specific what generic things you are referring to? I
am asking because the only part of the changes which is used in my
low-level driver only is introduced in another patch of this series.
It's
< [PATCH v7 19/20] PCI: dwc: Introduce generic platform clocks and resets
The new clock/reset request interface has been implemented the way it
is due to reasons I in details described to Rob here:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220520160246.guczq52v2ycfgc6c@mobilestation
To cut it short it can't be used by the most of the already available
low-level drivers since they already have their own versions of the
names for the clock and reset resources (or don't have any name
defined at all). The only driver for which the interface could be
utilized is Toshiba Visconti PCIe host controller driver. The device
DT-bindings defines the clock names matching the generic names
introduced in the patches of this series. If you find it appropriate
enough I can provide a patch for that driver.

Note the main goal of the patch
[PATCH v7 19/20] PCI: dwc: Introduce generic platform clocks and resets
was to create some interface to stop the developers of the new drivers
from creating the platform-specific DT-bindings to the same clock and
reset resources. Since the already defined DT-bindings can't be
changed anyway I don't think it would worth risking to catch
regressions on an attempt to provide a more complicated interface
utilized in the old drivers too.
