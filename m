Well, the options here are basically:

a) Do nothing, and just expect people to update their BIOSes, since an
update is available.
b) Do nothing, and expect people with broken BIOSes to `echo blacklist
tpm >> /etc/modprobesomethingsomething`.
c) Figure out how to identify the buggy BIOS and disable the TPM's rng
with a quirk in this case.
d) Figure out how to dynamically detect TPM rng latency, and warn about it.
e) Figure out how to dynamically detect TPM rng latency, and disable it.

I think given that a firmware update *is* available, (a) is fine. And
the generic workaround remains (b). But if you want to be really nice,
(c) would be fine too. Somebody with the affected hardware would
probably have to send in some DMI logs or whatever else. (d) and (e)
sound possible in theory but I dunno really... seems finicky.
