That's unrelated. That's because you have specified a sink and without
--per-thread it tries to open the event on all cores. If the sink can't
be reached from all cores it will fail to open. You can make it work
without --per-thread if you limit it to a valid core like this, although
I don't know which ones exactly would be valid for your system:


  perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etf63/k --kcore -C 0 \
     -- taskset --cpu-list 1 uname
