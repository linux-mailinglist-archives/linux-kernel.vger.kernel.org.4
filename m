There is no relationship between the ownership of the AER related 
register and the ownership of the AER capability in the OS or Firmware. 
The processing here is to initialize the AER related register, not the 
AER event. If Firmware is configured with AER register, it will not be 
able to handle the runtime hot reset and link retrain cases in addition 
to the hotplug case you mentioned below.

What information does the OS use to decide how to configure AER? The 
ACPI Spec has the following description: PCI Express (PCIe) root ports 
may implement PCIe Advanced Error Reporting (AER) support. This 
table(HEST) contains  information platform firmware supplies to OSPM for 
configuring AER support on a given root port. We understand that HEST 
stands for user to express expectations.

In the current implementation, the OS already configures a PCIE device 
based on _HPP/_HPX method when configuring a PCI device inserted into a 
hot-plug slot or initial configuration of a PCI device at system boot. 
HEST is just another way to express the desired configuration of the user.

Yours sincerely,
Leoliu-oc
