That definitely did not come from me.  My requirement all along has
been to support a single self-signed CA certificate for the end
user/customer use case, so that they could create and load their own
public key, signed by that CA, onto the trusted IMA/EVM keyrings.

I totally agree with Coiby that there is no need for intermediate CA
certificates be vouched for by a root CA certificate.  In fact the
closer the CA certificate is to the leaf code signing certificate, the
better.  As much as possible we want to limit the CA keys being loaded
onto the machine keyring to those that are absolutely required.

thanks,

Mimi
