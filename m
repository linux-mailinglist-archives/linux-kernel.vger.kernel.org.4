I guess, if they have access to the binary, etc.
So they need both access to the binary and to the tracefs directory.
We would not give them access like this in any normal setup other than a
developer environment.

We do not need unpriv to delete events, only to write and create events.

We allow unregistering call-sites, which would still work unpriv with
this requirement.

How is this different than uprobes if we give a user access to
/sys/kernel/tracing/dynamic_events? Users can delete those as well. I
don't see a difference here.

In our production environments we are not giving out wide security to
this file.
