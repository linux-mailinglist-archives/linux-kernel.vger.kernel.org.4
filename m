Yes, it's unfortunately because we have to keep the event in the hashtable.

Typically we'd just remove the event from the hashtable, ref_dec and
then upon final ref_dec free it. The problem with that is the event in
the hashtable is an actual trace_event exposed via tracefs/perf. It
prevents us from removing it at this time as the comment tries to
explain.

Thanks for pointing this out, I likely need another comment in the code
explaining why this is ok.

It might smell that way :) But the only way once it's zero to get
another reference is by acquiring event_mutex and then calling
find_user_event(). This is why it's important that at this phase we hold
the event_mutex in all cases.

Once we set it to 1, we cannot get into this code path again until the
work that was queued is finished. The scheduled work acquires
event_mutex and ensures it's still the last reference before doing any
actual deletion or a refcount_dec that would allow for another work
queue via this path.

> Will mutex_lock help somehow? If yes, then why atomic refcnt?

I hopefully fully explained the mutex_lock above, if it's confusing
still let me know. The rason for the atomic refcnt though is because you
initially get a reference to a user_event via find_user_event() under
the lock, but then each FD (and each enabler) has a reference to the
underlying user_event (and thus the trace_event). Fork() and enablement
registers are done outside of this lock for performance reasons. When
the task exits, we also close down the enablers for that mm/task, and so
the lock is not there either (and why having the less used
refcount_dec_and_mutex_lock being required on put when it's not
acquired).

Thanks,
