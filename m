Subject: [PATCH v2] KVM: Fix comments that refer to the non-existent install_new_memslots()

The function of install_new_memslots() was replaced by kvm_swap_active_memslots().
In order to avoid confusion, fix the comments that refer the non-existent name of
install_new_memslots which always be ignored.

Fixes: a54d806688fe ("KVM: Keep memslots in tree-based structures instead of array-based ones")
