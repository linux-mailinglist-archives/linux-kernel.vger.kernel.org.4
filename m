Yes, I checked this. What I was noticed is that these tools have the same
lower and upper limits for the required version. (so min-tool-version.sh
was sufficient.) Since there is a range between the lower and upper limits
for Clang, I thought that if we are going to do version checking, we need
to extend min-tool-version.sh or something related to it.

I understand that at least this issue will be fixed in the near future (v6.6?).
I will wait and see for a while...
