From a quick scan, I still don't think this is quite right, and as it stands I
believe this will break backtracing (as the instructions before the function
entry point will not be symbolized correctly, getting in the way of
RELIABLE_STACKTRACE). I think I was insufficiently clear with my earlier
feedback there, as I have a mechanism in mind that wa a little simpler.

I'll try to reply with some more detail tomorrow, but I don't think this is the
right approach, and as mentioned previously (and e.g. at LPC) I'd strongly
prefer to *not* implement direct calls, so that we can have more consistent
entry/exit handling.

Thanks,
Mark.
