Um how?  The observation is in the above referenced email is that PCR23
is reserved in the TCG literature for application usage.  If any
application is actually using PCR23 based on that spec then revoking
access to user space will cause it to break.  This is an ABI change
which is not backwards compatible.  You can call it a distro problem if
it's command line configurable, but the default would be what most
distros take, so it's rather throwing them under the bus if there is an
application using it.

Of course, if no application is actually using PCR23, then it's
probably OK to use it in the kernel and make it invisible to user
space, but no evidence about this has actually been presented.
