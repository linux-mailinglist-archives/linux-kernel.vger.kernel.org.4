And I feel silly, because I did run them, and could have sworn they
passed...looking now at the change_status_after_alloc testcase I see
you're of course correct. Very poor example, thank you for pointing it
out.

Sigh, yeah, another ___ workaround but I agree it's probably the best we
can do for now, and in general seems pretty useful. Obviously preferable
to this patch which just doesn't work. Alexei, are you OK with this? If
so, I'll take this approach for v2.
