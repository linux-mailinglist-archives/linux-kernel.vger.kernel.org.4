It's to workaround a deficiency in KVM.

TL;DR: 100% agree, and we're working on fixing this in KVM, but were still months
away from a full solution.

Yep.  KVM uses mmu_notifiers to react to mapping changes, with a few caveats that
we are (slowly) fixing, though those caveats are only tangentially related.

The deficiency in KVM is that KVM's internal APIs to translate a virtual address
to a physical address spit out only the resulting host PFN.  The details of _how_
that PFN was acquired are not captured.  Specifically, KVM loses track of whether
or not a PFN was acquired via gup() or follow_pte() (KVM is very permissive when
it comes to backing guest memory).

Because gup() gifts the caller a reference, that means KVM also loses track of
whether or not KVM holds a page refcount.  To avoid pinning guest memory, KVM does
quickly put the reference gifted by gup(), but because KVM doesn't _know_ if it
holds a reference, KVM uses a heuristic, which is essentially "is the PFN associated
with a 'normal' struct page?".

   /*
    * Returns a 'struct page' if the pfn is "valid" and backed by a refcounted
    * page, NULL otherwise.  Note, the list of refcounted PG_reserved page types
    * is likely incomplete, it has been compiled purely through people wanting to
    * back guest with a certain type of memory and encountering issues.
    */
   struct page *kvm_pfn_to_refcounted_page(kvm_pfn_t pfn)

That heuristic also triggers if follow_pte() resolves to a PFN that is associated
with a "struct page", and so to avoid putting a reference it doesn't own, KVM does
the silly thing of manually getting a reference immediately after follow_pte().

And that in turn gets tripped up non-refcounted tail pages because KVM sees a
normal, valid "struct page" and assumes it's refcounted.  To fudge around that
issue, KVM requires "struct page" memory to be refcounted.

The long-term solution is to refactor KVM to precisely track whether or not KVM
holds a reference.  Patches have been prosposed to do exactly that[1], but they
were put on hold due to the aforementioned caveats with mmu_notifiers.  The
caveats are that most flows where KVM plumbs a physical address into hardware
structures aren't wired up to KVM's mmu_notifier.

KVM could support non-refcounted struct page memory without first fixing the
mmu_notifier issues, but I was (and still am) concerned that that would create an
even larger hole in KVM until the mmu_notifier issues are sorted out[2].
