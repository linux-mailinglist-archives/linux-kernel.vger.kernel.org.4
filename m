A vdso and a new kernel syscall is also a highly Linux-specific thing,
so I do not understand the objection here at all.  You're going to have
to wrap all of this up in some sort of common userspace library code
anyway, and that will have to handle all of the different operating
system implementations.

Also, frankly, I don't care about non-Linux implementations, so that
isn't a valid argument here :)
