IDK if it's relevant here, but I did see a commit go by to LLVM that
seemed to include such info in a custom ELF section (for the purposes of
improving fuzzing, IIUC). Maybe such an encoding scheme could be tested
to see if it's reliable or usable?

Yeah, at least a bug report is good. "See something, say something."
