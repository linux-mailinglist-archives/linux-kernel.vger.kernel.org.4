[+cc Lukas, in case you have comment on acpi_pci_power_manageable()]

There's a little bit of cognitive dissonance between the subject and
the comment line:

  PCI/ACPI: Don't assume D3 support if a device is power manageable
  +	/* Assume D3 support if the bridge is power-manageable by ACPI. */

I suggest tweaking the subject to mention the actual issue here.  It
looks like it might be something to do with _S0W?

This paragraph sounds like it describes where you found the problem,
but I don't think it helps us understand what the problem *is* or how
to make sure the patch will work on other systems.

I'm not very familiar with device links.  How does the link misbehave?
Is the link doing something wrong, or is it just that we're putting
one of the devices in the wrong power state?

I assume the USB4 router would be a descendant of the Root Port.
Generally descendants can be in lower-power states than their parents.
What expresses the constraint that the router must stay in D0 because
its parent is in D0?

It looks like acpi_pci_power_manageable(dev) means "the device has
_PS0 or _PR0".  Currently we assume that means we can put dev in D3.

And I think you're saying that assumption is a little bit too
aggressive because if _S0W says the device can't wake from D3hot or
D3cold, we should *not* use D3?

IIUC the intervening code doesn't check whether D3hot/D3cold can be
*reached*, but whether the device can *wake* from D3hot/D3cold.

For maintenance purposes, I think it will be helpful to know
specifically which devices are involved (e.g., the PCI bus/device/fns
would show the PCI relationship) and how the firmware says the Root
Port can't handle D3.  I assume this would be _S0W?

Maybe even a pidgin example of the ACPI pieces involved here, e.g.,

  RP01._PR0
  RP01._S0W (0x0)    # in S0, can wake from D0 only
