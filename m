I evaluated the first one, and yes, I do want this, but I haven't tested
it out yet, sorry.

I get patches for header files all the time and hand-verifying that they
don't break the abi is a pain at times

That's not ok, and needs to be fixed, otherwise this is useless as no
one can rely on it at all.

That needs to be unwound and fixed.

ctrl-c can be properly caught and the git state needs to be restored for
this to be able to be accepted.
