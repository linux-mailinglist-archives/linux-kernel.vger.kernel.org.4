Yes, it would eventually go away. As for adding the PIDs, the
fundamental issue is, unlike other drivers, except for the "PIDs"
everything else is architected and each CPU has this PID alone
different and we have plenty of CPUs implementaions out there.

But all that said, since we added this as an AMBA driver in the first
place (all for simply getting the apb_clk management), I am happy to
choose the "Add PIDs to stable kernel approach" for this problem.

This was mainly due to (1), given we have a platform driver anyway for
ACPI. As mentioned above, we could leave the DT alone.

This alone wouldn't be sufficient. We need a platform driver anyway to
handle the two different modes in  ACPI for ETMs. But this will be a
an option for the other CoreSight components which are always MMIO.
