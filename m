I'm sure that's the intent, but I don't see that restriction in the
spec.  Here's what I'm looking at, which doesn't directly restrict
generation of EDR notifications:

  If control of this feature was requested and denied, or was not
  requested, firmware is responsible for initializing Downstream Port
  Containment Extended Capability Structures per firmware policy.
  Further, [the OS is permitted to write several registers while
  processing an EDR notification]

No, that's not what I'm thinking at all.  I definitely would not want
to add a new _DSM, which would add yet another case the OS has to
handle.

In the firmware-first case, the firmware collects the error status and
clears it before handing the info off to the OS error handling path.

In the native case, the OS should be able to collect the error status
and clear it before starting the OS error handling path.  Same
register accesses, should be indistinguishable from the device point
of view, it's just that the register accesses would be done by the OS
instead of by firmware.
