I can agree with this - disabled APIC is indeed a valid use case, if a VM doesn't
use all the vCPUs it was assigned, and hotplugs them later.

Thus I can agree to leave it as is for Intel, although if our goal is to be as
close to x86 spec as possible as you said, then it is more correct to do it as I suggested,
because it is still better to be compliant to the x86 spec in one case of two,
that to be compliant in none of the cases.

I am not going to argue about this though.
