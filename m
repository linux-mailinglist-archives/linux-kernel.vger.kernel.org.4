Here's a thought, what if we had a static/cmd line configurable
no-auth NV Index and writelocked it with the expected key information,
name or something. I guess the problem is atomicity with write/lock,
but can't the kernel lock out all other users?

An attacker would need to issue tpm2_startup, which in this case would DOS
the kernel in both scenarios. If an attacker already wrote and locked the NV
index, that would also be a DOS. If they already wrote it, the kernel simply
writes whatever they want. Is there an attack I am missing?

I guess the issue here would be setup, since creating the NV index requires
hierarchy auth, does the kernel have platform auth or is that already shut down
by firmware (I can't recall)? A null hierarchy volatile lockable index would be
nice for this, too bad that doesn't exist.
