The Energy Aware Scheduler (EAS) estimates the energy consumption
of placing a task on different CPUs. The goal is to minimize this
energy consumption. Estimating the energy of different task placements
is increasingly complex with the size of the platform. To avoid having
a slow wake-up path, EAS is only enabled if this complexity is low
enough.

The current complexity limit was set in:
commit b68a4c0dba3b1 ("sched/topology: Disable EAS on inappropriate
platforms").
base on the first implementation of EAS, which was re-computing
the power of the whole platform for each task placement scenario, cf:
commit 390031e4c309 ("sched/fair: Introduce an energy estimation helper
function").
but the complexity of EAS was reduced in:
commit eb92692b2544d ("sched/fair: Speed-up energy-aware wake-ups")
and find_energy_efficient_cpu() (feec) algorithm was updated in:
commit 3e8c6c9aac42 ("sched/fair: Remove task_util from effective
utilization in feec()")

find_energy_efficient_cpu() (feec) is now doing:
feec()
\_ for_each_pd(pd) [0]
  // get max_spare_cap_cpu and compute_prev_delta
  \_ for_each_cpu(pd) [1]

  \_ eenv_pd_busy_time(pd) [2]
	\_ for_each_cpu(pd)

  // compute_energy(pd) without the task
  \_ eenv_pd_max_util(pd, -1) [3.0]
    \_ for_each_cpu(pd)
  \_ em_cpu_energy(pd, -1)
    \_ for_each_ps(pd)

  // compute_energy(pd) with the task on prev_cpu
  \_ eenv_pd_max_util(pd, prev_cpu) [3.1]
    \_ for_each_cpu(pd)
  \_ em_cpu_energy(pd, prev_cpu)
    \_ for_each_ps(pd)

  // compute_energy(pd) with the task on max_spare_cap_cpu
  \_ eenv_pd_max_util(pd, max_spare_cap_cpu) [3.2]
    \_ for_each_cpu(pd)
  \_ em_cpu_energy(pd, max_spare_cap_cpu)
    \_ for_each_ps(pd)

[3.1] happens only once since prev_cpu is unique. With the same
definitions for nr_pd, nr_cpus and nr_ps, the complexity is of:
nr_pd * (2 * [nr_cpus in pd] + 2 * ([nr_cpus in pd] + [nr_ps in pd]))
+ ([nr_cpus in pd] + [nr_ps in pd])

 [0]  * (     [1] + [2]      +       [3.0] + [3.2]                  )
+ [3.1]

= nr_pd * (4 * [nr_cpus in pd] + 2 * [nr_ps in pd])
+ [nr_cpus in prev pd] + nr_ps

The complexity limit was set to 2048 in:
commit b68a4c0dba3b1 ("sched/topology: Disable EAS on inappropriate
platforms")
to make "EAS usable up to 16 CPUs with per-CPU DVFS and less than 8
performance states each". For the same platform, the complexity would
actually be of:
16 * (4 + 2 * 7) + 1 + 7 = 296

Since the EAS complexity was greatly reduced, bigger platforms can
handle EAS. For instance, a platform with 112 CPUs with 7 performance
states each would not reach it:
112 * (4 + 2 * 7) + 1 + 7 = 2024

To reflect this improvement, remove the EAS complexity check.

-6.3 - Energy Model complexity
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-
-The task wake-up path is very latency-sensitive. When the EM of a platform is
-too complex (too many CPUs, too many performance domains, too many performance
-states, ...), the cost of using it in the wake-up path can become prohibitive.
-The energy-aware wake-up algorithm has a complexity of:
-
-	C = Nd * (Nc + Ns)
-
-with: Nd the number of performance domains; Nc the number of CPUs; and Ns the
-total number of OPPs (ex: for two perf. domains with 4 OPPs each, Ns = 8).
-
-A complexity check is performed at the root domain level, when scheduling
-domains are built. EAS will not start on a root domain if its C happens to be
-higher than the completely arbitrary EM_MAX_COMPLEXITY threshold (2048 at the
-time of writing).
-
-If you really want to use EAS but the complexity of your platform's Energy
-Model is too high to be used with a single root domain, you're left with only
-two possible options:
-
-    1. split your system into separate, smaller, root domains using exclusive
-       cpusets and enable EAS locally on each of them. This option has the
-       benefit to work out of the box but the drawback of preventing load
-       balance between root domains, which can result in an unbalanced system
-       overall;
-    2. submit patches to reduce the complexity of the EAS wake-up algorithm,
-       hence enabling it to cope with larger EMs in reasonable time.
