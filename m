Are you seeing any problem with that?

This has been a problematic area on powerpc. See, for instance, commits:
- 9ed5df69b79a22 ("powerpc/kprobes: Use probe_address() to read instruction=
s")
- 21f8b2fa3ca5b0 ("powerpc/kprobes: Ignore traps that happened in real mode=
")

I think we should close this race, perhaps by instroducing another=20
synchronize_rcu() in unregister_kprobe(), allowing architectures using=20
stop_machine() to override that. That would be cleaner.

Masami answered why we need the else part comparing the instruction at=20
addr with the breakpoint instruction. It is to check if the breakpoint=20
instruction has been removed since we hit it, but before the processor=20
reached the kprobe handler.

!p means the kprobe has been removed - there may or may not be another=20
breakpoint instruction at that address.

We do this since we now know that there is no breakpoint at this=20
address, so we should not continue.

If there is a breakpoint instruction at that address, we should let the=20
kernel continue processing the breakpoint.

As another data point, you may want to look at kprobe_handler() in=20
arch/powerpc/kernel/kprobes.c . We also handle cases where there is a=20
different type of breakpoint instruction.
