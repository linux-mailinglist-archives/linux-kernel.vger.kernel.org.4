The ABI for user_events has changed from mmap() based to remote writes.
Update the documentation to reflect these changes, add new section for
unregistering events since lifetime is now tied to tasks instead of
files.

+Unregistering
+-------------
+If after registering an event it is no longer wanted to be updated then it can
+be disabled via ioctl() out to the /sys/kernel/tracing/user_events_data file.
+The command to issue is DIAG_IOCSUNREG. This is different than deleting, where
+deleting actually removes the event from the system. Unregistering simply tells
+the kernel your process is no longer interested in updates to the event.
 
-Currently the size of user_events_status is a single page, however, custom
-kernel configurations can change this size to allow more user based events. In
-all cases the size of the file is a multiple of a page size.
+This command takes a packed struct user_unreg as an argument::
 
-For example, if the register ioctl() gives back a status_bit of 3 you would
-check byte 0 (3 / 8) of the returned mmap data and then AND the result with 8
-(1 << (3 % 8)) to see if anything is attached to that event.

+Status
+------
+When tools attach/record user based events the status of the event is updated
+in realtime. This allows user programs to only incur the cost of the write() or
+writev() calls when something is actively attached to the event.
 
-  if (status_page[index] & mask) {
-        /* Enabled */
-  }
+The kernel will update the specified bit that was registered for the event as
+tools attach/detach from the event. User programs simply check if the bit is set
+to see if something is attached or not.
 
 Administrators can easily check the status of all registered events by reading
 the user_events_status file directly via a terminal. The output is as follows::
 
-  Byte:Name [# Comments]
+  Name [# Comments]
   ...
 
   Active: ActiveCount
   Busy: BusyCount
-  Max: MaxCount
 
 For example, on a system that has a single event the output looks like this::
 
-  1:test
+  test
 
   Active: 1
   Busy: 0
-  Max: 32768
 
 If a user enables the user event via ftrace, the output would change to this::
 
-  1:test # Used by ftrace
+  test # Used by ftrace
 
   Active: 1
   Busy: 1
-  Max: 32768
-
-**NOTE:** *A status bit of 0 will never be returned. This allows user programs
-to have a bit that can be used on error cases.*
