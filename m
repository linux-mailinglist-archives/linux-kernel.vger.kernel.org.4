This is yet another case where you've mechanically described the "what",
but left out the implications or the underlying basis "why".

I'd take a more methodical approach to describe what is going on here.
List the steps that must occur, or at least *one* example of those steps
and how they intereact with the code in this patch.  Then, explain the
fallout.

I also don't think it's quite right to call out "CXL memory via kmem
driver".  If the CXL memory was "System RAM", it should get covered by a
CMR and TDMR.  The kmem driver can still go wild with it.

I'm frankly lost now.  Please go back and try to explain this better.
Let me know if you want to iterate on this faster than resending this
series five more times.  I've got some ideas.

Let's say that we add this TDX-compatible-node ABI in the future.  What
will old code do that doesn't know about this ABI?

I was hoping you would actually explain why it is impossible.

Is there something fundamental that keeps a memory area that spans two
nodes from being removed and then a new area added that is comprised of
a single node?

Boot time:

	| memblock  |  memblock |
	<--Node=0--> <--Node=1-->

Funky hotplug... nothing to see here, then:

	<--------Node=2-------->

I would believe that there is no current bare-metal TDX system that has
an implementation like this.  But, the comments above speak like it's
fundamentally impossible.  That should be clarified.

In other words, that comment talks about memblock attributes as being
the core underlying reason that that simplified check is OK.  Is that
it, or is it really the reduced hotplug feature set on TDX systems?

I don't think I'd hate it being in all three spots.  Also "protected by
memory hotplug locking" is pretty generic.  Please be more specific.

I actually want that snippet in the changelog.
