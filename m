Saying it's for some Intel FPGA just makes it sound like it should only
live within the driver for that FPGA.  The issue with there being only
one user:

is part of it, as is the fact that the naming is so very generic.  Even
"Intel FPGA" seems to be heading to the generic side, this is presumably
some specific thing rather than just something that everyone using a
FPGA from Intel is going to need.  The issue with this being overly
specific isn't just the name, it's the code as well.

So this interface is part of the physical IP surrounding the actual
programmable bit of a FPGA or something?  That doesn't seem entirely
right though given the fact that the registers are apparently one of the
things that gets moved around a lot.  I still have no idea what this
hardware actually looks like or what this code is trying to represent,
especially given the very few things that you are trying to
parameterise.  It's really not obvious there's even any point in trying
to share this code at the abstraction level you've gone for.

Do you have any examples of even a second user that isn't this one MFD
which you can share?

I keep telling you to either make this so that it's actually generic or
just have register get/set operations in the regmap for the device using
it.  As things stand with the code you've sent there's a bunch of things
like the way it's doing direct MMIO (which means it only works on top of
memory mapped devices) and the absolute requirement for an idle command
and a wait for completion which clearly look like this is device specific.

If you think this should be shared via regmap then make it shareable.
That needs more work than just repainting the name.
