[+ Quentin, who is looking at this as well]

At this stage, I'm more keen on option (2). It solves your immediate
issue, and while it doesn't improve the humongous block mapping case,
it doesn't change the behaviour of the existing walkers (you are
guaranteed to visit a leaf only once per traversal).

Option (3) is more of a long term goal, and I'd rather we improve
things in now.

Thanks,

	M.
