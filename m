> +Success Auditing
> +^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
> +
> +IPE supports success auditing. When enabled, all events that pass IPE
> +policy and are not blocked will emit an audit event. This is disabled by
> +default, and can be enabled via the kernel command line
> +``ipe.success_audit=3D(0|1)`` or the securityfs node,
> +``/sys/kernel/security/ipe/success_audit``.
> +
> +This is *very* noisy, as IPE will check every userspace binary on the
> +system, but is useful for debugging policies.
> +
> +.. NOTE::
> +
> +   If a traditional MAC system is enabled (SELinux, apparmor, smack, etc=
etera),
> +   all writes to ipe's securityfs nodes require ``CAP_MAC_ADMIN``.
> +
> +Properties
> +----------
> +
> +As explained above, IPE properties are ``key=3Dvalue`` pairs expressed in
> +IPE policy. Two properties are built-into the policy parser: 'op' and
> +'action'. The other properties are determinstic attributes to express
> +across files. Currently those properties are: '``boot_verified``',
> +'``dmverity_signature``', '``dmverity_roothash``', '``fsverity_signature=
``',
> +'``fsverity_digest``'. A description of all properties supported by IPE
> +are listed below:
> +
> +op
> +~~
> +
> +Indicates the operation for a rule to apply to. Must be in every rule,
> +as the first token. IPE supports the following operations:
> +
> +   ``EXECUTE``
> +
> +      Pertains to any file attempting to be executed, or loaded as an
> +      executable.
> +
> +   ``FIRMWARE``:
> +
> +      Pertains to firmware being loaded via the firmware_class interface.
> +      This covers both the preallocated buffer and the firmware file
> +      itself.
> +
> +   ``KMODULE``:
> +
> +      Pertains to loading kernel modules via ``modprobe`` or ``insmod``.
> +
> +   ``KEXEC_IMAGE``:
> +
> +      Pertains to kernel images loading via ``kexec``.
> +
> +   ``KEXEC_INITRAMFS``
> +
> +      Pertains to initrd images loading via ``kexec --initrd``.
> +
> +   ``POLICY``:
> +
> +      Controls loading polcies via reading a kernel-space initiated read.
> +
> +      An example of such is loading IMA policies by writing the path
> +      to the policy file to ``$securityfs/ima/policy``
> +
> +   ``X509_CERT``:
> +
> +      Controls loading IMA certificates through the Kconfigs,
> +      ``CONFIG_IMA_X509_PATH`` and ``CONFIG_EVM_X509_PATH``.
> +
> +action
> +~~~~~~
> +
> +   Determines what IPE should do when a rule matches. Must be in every
> +   rule, as the final clause. Can be one of:
> +
> +   ``ALLOW``:
> +
> +      If the rule matches, explicitly allow access to the resource to pr=
oceed
> +      without executing any more rules.
> +
> +   ``DENY``:
> +
> +      If the rule matches, explicitly prohibit access to the resource to
> +      proceed without executing any more rules.
> +
> +boot_verified
> +~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> +
> +   This property can be utilized for authorization of the first super-bl=
ock

property.

> +
> +
> +   .. WARNING::
