Read again my message. Binding is not coupled with drivers. Binding is
coupled with hardware because it describes the DTS written for hardware,
not for drivers.

I did not say that binding will not affect the drivers. I said that
design of binding is somehow independent (at least partially) from
drivers and once you answer to question "how the hardware looks?"
several problems dissapear. You create here some questions and problems
because you have inaccurate hardware description (e.g. two devices -
some fake "EDAC" and frequency scaler device...).

No, that's not true. I also gave you hints to solve it - MFD, simple-mfd
etc.

No, again not true. You can have infinite number of drivers getting
probed as result of one device node in DTS.

I repeated it many, many times. Describe the hardware. Now you again
ignore all my comments and mention that you need two devices because you
have two drivers.

I repeated it way too many times, so the last:
Most likely you have one hardware, so there is one device in DTS.
Describe in DTS the hardware, not the driver model/binding/problems you
have.

What do you mean by "split interchangeably"? I understood there is *one*
hardware device, not two. One memory controller. Do you want to say you
have two independent memory controllers for the same IO address space?

Anyway, reviewing real patches takes priority of reviewing imaginary
solutions, so please send patches. Otherwise it's end of discussion to
me. If you still have questions, please go back to what I repeated many
times - describe hardware in DT, not the drivers.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
