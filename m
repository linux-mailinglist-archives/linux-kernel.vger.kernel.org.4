I was mistaken, the V2 patch *was* on the mailing list:
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/1664288166-7432-1-git-send-email-lixiaochun.2888@163.com

I guess I didn't find it because I was searching for the email address
"lixc17@lenovo.com", and v2 was posted by "lixiaochun.2888@163.com".

Sorry, my mistake!  It looks like the sending of v2 was just fine.
