Hi Jerry,

I wouldn't say never but I doubt any time soon for 2^8. DSA 1.0 has 8 
WQs, and 2.0 (spec just went public) has 16. But yes we can use bitmap 
to be future proof. Are you currently working on a fix for this? Just 
don't want to duplicate effort if you already have something going. 
Thank you!
