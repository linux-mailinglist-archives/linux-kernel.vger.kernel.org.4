correct.

limit the use for PTR_TRUSTED to verifier only?
and introduce PTR_TRUSTED_BECAUSE_IT_CAME_FROM_KERNEL as well?
But the patch we're discussing will be treating them the same way...
Or you're proposing the kfunc writer also suppose to add two flags to a kfunc:
KF_TRUSTED_ARGS | KF_TRUSTED_BECAUSE_KERNEL_ARGS ?

and that's where it comes back to the point I keep stressing in this thread:
The kfunc writer should not be exposed to such details.
The little people need to understand about the verifier when the write bpf
programs or provide kfuncs the better.

yes, but 'holding the reference' is not the only option.
Holding rcu_read_lock is fine too.
Or any other mechanism that ensures that the pointer has guaranteed lifetime.

and back to my earlier point...
using your logic we'd need PTR_TRUSTED_BECAUSE_RCU in the verifier and
corresponding KF_TRUSTED_ARGS_BECAUSE_RCU flag on kfunc.
That just doesn't scale.

PTR_RCU flag might actually be needed for some other reason, but
KF_TRUSTED_ARGS_BECAUSE_RCU is "too much info" for kfunc providers.

yes.

Correct. allowlisting kernel func's btf_ids is one approach.
I might argue that fentry hook on any kernel func that has 'struct nf_conn *'
as an argument is also safe (barring recursion into bpf_ct_* kfuncs).
Dual compiler of the kernel (native + bpf) will help this kind of safety analysis.
