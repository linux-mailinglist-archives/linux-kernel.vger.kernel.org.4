Are you referring to the support for hardware-wrapped inline crypto keys?  It
isn't upstream yet, but my latest patchset is at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20220927014718.125308-2-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u.
There's also a version of it used by some Android devices already.  Out of
curiosity, are you using it in an Android device, or have you adopted it in some
other downstream?

Anyway, that feature does indeed use a boolean flag to indicate whether the key
is hardware-wrapped or not.  And yes, it doesn't use the crypto API.  Nor does
it use the keyrings subsystem, for that matter.

However, the design of hardware-wrapped inline crypto keys is that keys are
scoped to a particular block device (or a set of block devices), which are
assumed to have only one version of wrapped keys.  That makes the boolean flag
work, as it's always unambiguous what the keys mean.

I don't think that would work as well for the crypto API, which is a bit more
general.  In the crypto API, there can be an arbitrary number of crypto drivers,
each of which has its own version of hardware-wrapped (bound) keys.  So maybe
the existing design that is based on algorithm names is fine.

Note that the keyrings subsystem is not as useful as it might seem.  It sounds
like something you want (you have keys, and there is a subsystem called
"keyrings", so it should be used, right?), but often it isn't.  fscrypt has
mostly moved away from using it, as it caused lots of problems.  I would caution
against assuming that it needs to be part of any solution.
