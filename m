Hey Jason,

I read this mail before I left work today & had a think about it on the
bike home, and had a whole response thought out, got distracted and
forgot it all.. Hopefully I've remembered everything I had to say!

I'm not super pushed about the "maybe other things", since the "maybe
other things" that are in my head (errata and recently added extensions)
have never worked on xip kernels, and losing them isn't a regression.
Since XIP_KERNEL is deemed to be a "NONPORTABLE" option, we wouldn't
need alternatives to enable it for them, but changes would be required
for that to make the alternatives collapse to a build time thing.
Can deal with that iff someone actually does come along wanting it.

We do need to fix this so that situations like the one you hit can't
happen, while not regressing the level of support for xip, so some level
of "making it work" is needed, but I do agree that it needs to be done
in a less footgun way.

Initially I thought "great, lets always enable the alternatives
framework" but I don't think we can do that.
For the has_extension() stuff a fallback is fine, but I don't think that
applies to using alternatives for either errata or enabling extensions
at runtime.
I just don't really want to go through and modify the alternative macros
so that they're evaluated at build time for xip unless that is
absolutely required down the line. (I'd rather not even do it at all.)

Most of the things that are currently selecting RISCV_ALTERNATIVE do so
to patch in support for extensions or enable errata, and I don't think
we should expose those config options if the alternatives that they rely
on cannot be used. I think that means something like...

=2E..adding a "select RISCV_ALTERNATIVE if !XIP_KERNEL" to the
CONFIG_RISCV entry, and similarly to what you suggest here, swapping all
of the instances of "select RISCV_ALTERNATIVE" for "depends on
RISCV_ALTERNATIVE". That does still mean we can drop all of the
"depends on !XIP_KERNEL" that are littered around the place whereever we
are using alternatives & should only get the slow path for extension
checking for xip kernels.
That'd handle the issue that you pointed out, where if the select is
missing, my suggested change makes it appear to work if alternatives are
not enabled too.

The BUILD_BUG_ON idea is good too, probably not fixes material, but
might be worth having to prevent alternatives somehow being used when
XIP_KERNEL is set.

I'll try to whip something up tomorrow...

Thanks Jason,
Conor.
