How about:

PCI: mt7621: delay phy ports initialization

The problem is that PCI ports are not detected properly without this
delay for those devices so plugged
cards on them do not work at all. I don't really know how to write the
commit log clearer but I'll try adding
this cards plugged not working stuff :-)

We can add maybe also if you want:

Fixes: 2bdd5238e756 ("PCI: mt7621: Add MediaTek MT7621 PCIe host
controller driver")

Some devices like ZBT WE1326 and ZBT WF3526-P and some Netgear models need
to sleep a bit after calling the mt7621_pcie_init_port() driver function to get
into reliable boots for both warm and hard resets. The needed time for these
devices to always detect the ports seems to be from 75 to 100 milliseconds.
Without ports properly detected no card plugged into the PCI's work at all.
There is no datasheet or something similar to really understand why this
extra time is needed in these devices but not in most of the boards which
use mt7621 SoC. This issue has been reported by openWRT community and the
complete discussion is in [0]. The selected time of 100 milliseconds has
been also tested in these devices ending up in an always working platform.
Hence, properly add the extra 100 milliseconds msleep() function call to make
also these devices work.
