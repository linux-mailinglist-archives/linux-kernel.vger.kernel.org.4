Al, thanks for taking the time to answer in such detail although I can beli=
eve=20
that, to spot the mistakes in my patch and then write your email, it probab=
ly=20
took you 10 minutes or so :-)

Instead I had to read two or three times to make sense of it all. I will do=
 my=20
best to first rewrite these kmap_local_page() conversions in fs/ufs by=20
separating the work into three patches, as you recommended.

I'm pretty sure that the next attempt won't be applicable yet, because I mi=
ght=20
not fully understand your suggestions or I might not be able to implement t=
hem=20
correctly. I'm afraid I addressed something that, as it stands, is a little=
=20
beyond my knowledge and experience, so I hope you'll want to chime in and=20
comment on the next version as well.

When the changes to fs/ufs will be done I will also rewrite the patch for f=
s/
sysv which (as you pointed out) needs to be worked out according to the sam=
e=20
requirements.

I am sincerely grateful to you also because it seemed to me that I would ne=
ver=20
get any feedback regarding these two old patches.

Regards,

=46abio
