If that turns out to be the actual bottleneck. I haven't analyzed what 
exactly is causing the delay with increasing # VCPUs, so I'm just guessing.

Right now, we primarily use pthread_kill(SIG_IPI) to send a signal to 
each VCPU thread.

As Sean said "This is an awful lot of a complexity to take on for 
something that appears to be solvable in userspace."

I showed that it's possible. So from that point on, there has to be good 
justification why that complexity has to exist in kernel space to 
optimize this scenario.

Now, it's not my call to make. I'm just pointing out that it can be done 
and that there might be room for improvement in my quick prototype.
