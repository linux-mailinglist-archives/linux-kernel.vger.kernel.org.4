I agree, it seems pointless.

Ah, right, and I think I was even part of the conversation when this
was added :)

I'm not sure I would make the same choice today, though.  IMHO it's
kind of hard to defend choosing performance over data integrity.

If a platform really wants to sacrifice integrity for performance, it
could retain control of AER, and after Vidya's patch, Linux will leave
the ECRC configuration alone.

Straw-man: If Linux owns AER and ECRC is supported, enable ECRC by
default.  Retain "ecrc=off" to turn it off, but drop a note in dmesg
and taint the kernel.
