Hello Martin,

As I promised before, I'm now back with the vendor's reply regarding
AUDDDS. The information is still incomplete, but I have provided the
available details below. Please take a look.

AUDDDS is a direct digital synthesizer used as a clock source.  It is
not used as default. You need to modify some clk registers in dts to
enable it. Basically, it is used for audio.

In A1 design, you can use AUD DDS as a clock source and it is not
necessary. It is not used in the Amlogic default setting.

According to the vendor, it is not necessary and is currently disabled
by default. While we don't have much information about AUDDDS, the
vendor suggests that it's not a commonly used clock object in A1
projects and it may be skipped if not needed.

Based on all above information, I suppose we can skip it now.
