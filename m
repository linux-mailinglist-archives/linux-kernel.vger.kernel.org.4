Yeah, for vram itÅ› that simple. I think for mapped and sysmem regions we may require the
possiblity to ignore the limits as well, as it's possible to move to those regions from
eviction. We probably don't want eviction to fail because of too low limits.

> I do however agree that it is a limited use case. So from the negative side of the debating camp I have to ask if this use case could be simply satisfied by providing a driver/device global over commit yes/no control? In other words, is it really important to partition the vram space ahead of time, and from the kernel side too? Wouldn't the relevant (highly specialised) applications work just fine with global over commit disabled? Even if the option to configure their maximum allowed working set from the userspace side was needed.

Disabling overcommit? Do you mean pinning the memory workload? This causes a denial of service if
done without limits, and that's what we're trying to avoid. There is no need for immunity from
eviction. Overcommit is still useful inside the cgroup itself, we only want immunity from being
evicted by another process performing another workload.

> Or if we conclude cgroup controller is the way to go, would adding less specific limits make it more palatable? I am thinking here some generic "device memory resident". Not per device, not per memory region. So userspace/admins have some chance of configuring generic limits. That would require coming up with more generic use cases though so another thing to discuss. Like who would use that and for what.

You would run into ambiguity with that. I think it's fine to assume any number of vram regions. In most cases, the number is 1.

I don't see that number going much higher, 2 is already on the high side. A simple controller could just half each region separately.

> Assuming also we can agree that "device memory resident" is a stable/solid concept across drm. Should be easier than for integrated GPUs, for which I have to admit I currently don't remember if allocations are already consistently covered by the memory controller. Even if they are ownership is probably wrong.
Likely, especially when evicting another process' memory. That needs some thought. Likely we have to keep the original cgroup as an owner.
> Group ownership is possibly a concern in this proposal too. Because I remember the previous attempt of adding some drm stats to memcg explained that for instance on Android all buffers are allocated by a central process and then handed over to other processes. So transferring ownership was explained as critical.
Is this done using dma-buf? Ownership could be handed over on import then. If not, what is the mechanism they use?

I've deliberately added region to each key, so what happens is that drm.capacity/max/current contains: $pciid region.vram0=$value, that way, if we want to add non-memory resources, it becomes possible to do so by choosing a different prefix.

For example number of engines that can be created would also be possible to add to those files, but that might be more driver specific.

I tried to keep it generic like that. In this way I didn't immediately pollute the entire namespace.

Of course, if needed, we can make it drm.region_max etc instead and drop it from the cgroup key entries instead.

Cheers,

Maarten
