This sounds empirical and it probably is, is it asking too much please
to add why this delay is *actually* needed ? I think it is important
to understand that to make sure that in the future developers have a
clue about why this code was added.

At the very least add a Link: tag to the openwrt discussion.

See above, please define "proper". I don't have a problem with defining
multiple delays as long as we can define with certainty what they are
there for.

The problem is not adding more defines, the problem is defining what
the delay is there for. Reusing the macro may even turn out to be
misleading if that has nothing to do with PERST - that's what Bjorn
pointed out already.

Yes, see above.

Thanks,
