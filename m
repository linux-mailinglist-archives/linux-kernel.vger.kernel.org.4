I read through the SFrame spec file briefly. It looks like I can easily adapt my
version 1 of the livepatch patchset which was based on DWARF to SFrame. If the compiler
folks agree to properly support and maintain SFrame, then I could send the next version
of the patchset based on SFrame.

But I kinda need a clear path forward before I implement anything. I request the arm64
folks to comment on the above approach. Would it be useful to initiate an email discussion
with the compiler folks on what they plan to do to support SFrame? Or, should this all
happen face to face in some forum like LPC?
