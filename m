I don't have any objections on the change.

The big open is how we add new definitions without a 3-way deadlock
between PCI, sound and ASoC trees, and how those definitions can be
added to the -stable trees.

This isn't an hypothetical case, we have 2 pending submissions for
LunarLake [1] and ArrowLake [2] which will be provided as soon as the
merge window closes.

It's not clear to me if Bjorn is ok to let those audio-specific PCI IDs
go the audio trees, and how things would work between Mark and Takashi.
