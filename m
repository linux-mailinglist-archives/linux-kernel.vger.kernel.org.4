All other ACPI events that are available to userspace are on netlink alread=
y.
As for translation of ACPI paths. It is sort of a requirement for VMM
to translate the PCI path from host to guest because the PCI device
tree in the guest is totally different already. The same follows for
ACPI paths.

What would you propose instead of netlink?
Sysfs entry for VFIO PCI device that accepts eventfd and signals the
events via eventfd? Or moving it into ACPI layer entirely and adding
eventfd sysfs interface for all ACPI devices?
