Right, writing at an offset is pretty generic.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this one.
Are you saying that there should be a generic way to do "firmware"
uploads to mtd devices, based on some sort of structure defined in
devicetree etc?
And perhaps then, this driver would register as a consumer of that
interface, pushing all of the direct mtd stuff out to that interface?

I'm not very good with the security knobs so I don't have an answer for
you here (yet). But your assumption about the rationale here is correct
and I would like to block access.

I don't know what you mean. The mtd device could be empty and the
directory would need to be populated with the image address etc.
Or, it could previously have been used for something else, and then it
would be required to reconfigure it correctly for Auto Upgrade.

Maybe I am misunderstanding you?

The FPGA is flash based, so writing to the mtd device is not going to
actually program the FPGA with this content. The original image/bitstream
in the mtd device is either going to be a) equivalent to what is already
programmed in the FPGA, b) not an upgrade over what is current in the
FPGA, c) something that was uploaded since the last time the device was
restarted.
I don't think that overwriting any of those is problematic, as if the
verification fails, the original bitstream will continue being used
until an image that does actually pass is provided.

Without doing the verification though, there's no way to tell for certain
if the FPGA is actually going to perform an upgrade to this new bitstream
once it is restarted, so I think there is value in keeping this.

If you're still very sceptical about whether this belongs in
drivers/fpga, I can always dump it in drivers/soc instead I guess.

Cheers,
Conor.
