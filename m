Thanks.

It seems I was a bit naive and underestimated the amount of SEV
related processing that goes on in the decompressor after the EFI stub
has handed over. I will have to take some time and go through this,
and decide whether there is a way we can share this code with the EFI
stub without introducing yet another permutation that requires testing
and maintenance.

Any suggestions on how to test this stuff is appreciated - does QEMU
emulate any of this? Does consumer-level AMD hardware implement the
pieces I'd need to run a SEV host with SNP support etc?
