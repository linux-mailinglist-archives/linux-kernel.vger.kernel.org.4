user_event_mm_dup() puts a new mm into the global list before the
enablers list is fully populated. As it stands now, since it's in the
global list, it can get enumerated in a small timing window via the
tracing subsystem register callbacks when someone enables the event via
ftrace/perf.

Well, that's the problem I was trying to point out. The fork path calls
user_event_mm_dup() -> user_event_mm_create(), which DO expose this to
the trace world. I definitely need to fix that, then I can drop these RCU
paths in the enablers. It has been exposed out to the tracing tracepoint
paths, but it has yet to be exposed out to the newly forked process that
could cause data writes, add new events, disable them, etc.

Yes, after I fix the ordering of the mm add to the tracing global list.
That is clearly something I should have done originally and caused
confusion and extra RCU usage that is unneeded.

Got it, I was confused.
