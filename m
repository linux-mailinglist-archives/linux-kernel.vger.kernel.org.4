Indeed, that's not so easy. There are multiple ways for the SMT level to be
impacted:
 - smt-enabled kernel option
 - smtstate systemctl service (if activated), saving SMT level at shutdown
time to restore it a boot time
 - pseries-energyd daemon (if activated) could turn off threads
 - ppc64_cpu --smt=x user command
 - sysfs direct writing to turn off/on specific threads.

There is no SMT level saved, on "disk" or in the kernel, and any of these
options can interact in parallel. So from the user space point of view, the
best we could do is looking for the SMT current values, there could be
multiple values in the case of a mixed SMT state, peek one value and apply it.

Extending the drmgr's hook is still valid, and I sent a patch series on the
powerpc-utils mailing list to achieve that. However, changing the SMT level
in that hook means that newly added CPU will be first turn on and there is
a window where this threads could be seen active. Not a big deal but not
turning on these extra threads looks better to me.

That's being said, I can't see any benefit of a user space implementation
compared to the option I'm proposing in that patch.

Does anyone have a better idea?

Cheers,
Laurent.
