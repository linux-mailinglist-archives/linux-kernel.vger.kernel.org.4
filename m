The original cgroup_rstat_flush() iterates the list of blkg's in the 
blkg_list. A blkg will be removed from the list when it is offlined. 
This patch just reverts its behavior to that previous behavior.

I guess it is likely to be safe to flush an offline blkg. I am just 
being conservative in case there is any corner case where it may be a 
problem which I haven't foreseen.

It is possible that a blkg may be updated before it becomes offline, but 
the flush isn't done in time before that happens. The next patch will 
catch some of that.
