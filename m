Well, most of the series is needed, except for may be adding W^X
for the non-UEFI boot path (patches 3-9), but those add changes,
required for booting via UEFI, like memory protection call-backs.
And since the important callbacks are already in-place W^X for
non-UEFI won't be too undesired property.

The most part of this series (3-16,26,27) implements W^X, and
the remaining patches improves the compatibility of PE, which
includes:

* Removing W+X sections (which is now required as Gerd have already
   mentioned or at least very desired)
* Aligning sections to the page size in memory and to minimal
   file alignment in file.
* Aligning data structures on their natural alignment
   (e.g. [2] requires it)
* Filling more PE header fields to their actual values.
* Removing alignment flags on sections, which according to
   the spec, is only for object files.
* Filling in relocation data directory and its rounding the size
   to 4 bytes.

Most of this work is done in the patch 24 "x86/build: Make generated
PE more spec compliant", but it also requires working W^X due to
the removal of W+X sections and some clean-up work from patches
17-23.

This now is just one fairly straight forward patch, since the protocol
definitions are already got accepted and the protocol is used elsewhere
in the EFISTUB. This patch would also have to be replaced, rather than
removed if it's made a separate series, since it adds a warning about
W+X mappings.

The one hard  part that made the series more complicated is that
non-UEFI (or rather the only) boot path relocates the kernel, which
messes up the memory protection for sections set by the UEFI. I did not
want to remove the support of in-place extraction and relocation, when
loaded in inappropriate place, for the non-UEFI boot path, which is why
extraction from boot services was implemented. A proper W^X in EFISTUB
is a side effect, but the desired one.

The alternative would be to make the whole image RWX after the EFISTUB
execution. But the current approach is a lot nicer solution.

Ah, sorry, the branch was merged into master since I've first posted
the series, so the working link is:

https://github.com/acidanthera/audk

The loader itself is here:

I gave some explanations above, which are mostly the duplicates of
the patch 24 "x86/build: Make generated PE more spec compliant"
commit message.
