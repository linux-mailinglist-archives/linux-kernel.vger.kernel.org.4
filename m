It doesn't have a GUID. The table itself is a ACPI table that is
enumerated in the usual ACPI way. The problem is that the BGRT
describes a region in memory (where the OEM boot logo is), and this is
usually in EfiBootServicesData memory.

This data is typically used during early boot, to keep the logo intact
while the OS loader draws a nice animation below it. Not the end of
the world if it gets corrupted or removed.
