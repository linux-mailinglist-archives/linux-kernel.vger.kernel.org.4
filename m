This isn't strictly relevant to the current problem, so let's put this

It sounds like you have actual experience with this :)  Do you have
any concrete examples that we can use as "known breakage"?

This feels like a real problem to me.  There are existing mechanisms
(ACPI_FADT_NO_ASPM and _OSC PCIe cap ownership) the platform can use
to prevent the OS from using ASPM.

If vendors assume that *in addition*, the OS will pay attention to
whatever ASPM configuration BIOS did, that's a major disconnect.  We
don't do anything like that for other PCI features, and I'm not aware
of any restriction like that being documented.

Do you mean that when enumerating a device (at boot-time or hot-add
time), we would read the current ASPM config but not change it?  And
users could use the sysfs knobs to enable/disable ASPM as desired?
That wouldn't solve the problem Kai-Heng is trying to solve.

Or that we leave ASPM alone during boot-time enumeration, but enable
ASPM when we enumerate hot-added devices?  It doesn't sound right that
a device would be configured differently if present at boot vs
hot-added.
