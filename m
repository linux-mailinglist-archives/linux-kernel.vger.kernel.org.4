Out of curiosity: why the SMM support is so special that it's worth to
add a dedicated Kconfig entry for it?

After all, the current typical way to disable stuff (for testing, etc)
in KVM is to provide this possibility via a kvm module parameter.
This way it also can be switched on or off without having to rebuild the
kernel.

Looking at the patch it doesn't seem to disable that much of code (like,
significantly slim down the binary) and where it does disable something
it mostly relies on compiler dead code removal rather than explicit
#ifdefs (which would guarantee that the disabled code did not end in
the binary).

Thanks,
Maciej
