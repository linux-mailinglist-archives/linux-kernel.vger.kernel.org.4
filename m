As discussed off-list, attempting to fix up RMP violations in the host #PF handler
is not a viable approach.  There was also extensive discussion on-list a while back:

But for UPM, it's easy to rebuild the direct map since there will be an explicit,
kernel controlled point where the "inaccesible" memfd releases the private page.

The host actually isn't _forced_ to split with UPM.  One option would be to refuse
to split the direct map and instead force userspace to eat the 2mb allocation even
though it only wants to map a single 4kb chunk into the guest.  I don't know that
that's a _good_ option, but it is an option.
