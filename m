Catalin, Will, are you happy to pick this via the arm64 tree, or for it to go
via the trace tree?

We'd been assuming the former, but it looks like there'll be a (simple) merge
conflict with the series adding FUNCTION_GRAPH_RETVAL:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1680954589.git.pengdonglin@sangfor.com.cn/

... as both series add some definitions to arm64's asm-offsets.c in the same
place, and all those additions need to be kept. Other than that, the two series
are independent.

IIUC Steve was hoping to take the FUNCTION_GRAPH_RETVAL series through the
trace tree, and if that's still the plan, maybe both should go that way?

Mark.
