Drat, I was thinking KVM never flushes when aging SPTEs, but forgot about
clear_flush_young().

Rather than skipping if the Accessed bit is the only thing that's changing, what
about simply preserving the Accessed bit?  And s/prefetch/accessed in make_spte()
so that future changes to make_spte() don't make incorrect assumptions about the
meaning of "prefetch".

Another alternative would be to conditionally preserve the Accessed bit, i.e. clear
it if a flush is needed anyways, but that seems unnecessarily complex.

Yeah, you're right.  The host will see the "spurious" page fault but it will
never get injected into the guest.

But that raises the question of why?  No TLB flush is needed precisely because any
!WRITABLE fault will be treated as a spurious fault.  The cost of writing the
SPTE is minimal.  So why skip?  Skipping just to reclaim a low SPTE bit doesn't
seem like a good tradeoff, especially without a concrete use case for the SPTE bit.

E.g. on pre-Nehalem Intel CPUs, i.e. CPUs that don't support EPT and thus have
to use shadow paging, the CPU automatically retries accesses after the TLB flush
on permission faults.  The lazy approach might introduce a noticeable performance
regression on such CPUs due to causing more #PF VM-Exits than the current approach.
