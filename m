Yes, that is the existing behavior. It was not that well defined in the 
past and so it is somewhat ambiguous as to what we need to do about it.

BTW, cgroup1 has a memory_migrate flag which will force page migration 
if set. I guess you may have it set in your case as it will introduce a 
lot more delay as page migration takes time. That is probably the reason 
why you are seeing a long delay. So one possible solution is to turn 
this flag off. Cgroup v2 doesn't have this flag.

Yes, that can be the case.

So do you have suggestion of what we need to do going forward?
