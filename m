Thanks for explaining this to me. Yes, that makes sense and seems
useful. Could you please send a v2 and include the flow (1-7) above in
your commit message? Would be good to add one step with the setsockopt
SO_BINDTODEVICE before step #4 just to be clear. With those changes
please feel free to include my ack:
