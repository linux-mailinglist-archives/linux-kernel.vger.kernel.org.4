One thing I want to point out is: not having a block layer Rust API
doesn't keep the block layer away from Rust ;-) Rust will get in the way
as long as block layer is used, directly or indirectly, in any Rust code
in kernel.

Take the M1 GPU driver for example, it can totally be done without a drm
Rust API: Lina will have to directly call C funciton in her GPU driver,
but it's possible or she can have her own drm Rust binding which is not
blessed by the drm maintainers. But as long as drm is used in a Rust
driver, a refactoring/improvement of drm will need to take the usage of
Rust side into consideration. Unless of course, some one is willing to
write a C driver for M1 GPU.

The Rust bindings are actually the way of communication between
subsystem mantainers and Rust driver writers, and can help reduce the
amount of work: You can have the abstraction the way you like.

Of course, there is always "don't do it until there are actually users",
and I totally agree with that. But what is a better way to design the
Rust binding for a subsystem?

*	Sit down and use the wisdom of maintainers and active
	developers, and really spend time on it right now? Or

*	Let one future user drag the API/binding design to insaneness?

I'd rather prefer the first approach. Time spent is time saved.

Personally, my biggest fear is: RCU stalls/lockdep warnings in the Rust
code (or they don't happen because incorrect bindings), and who is going
to fix them ;-) So I have to spend my time on making sure these bindings
in good shapes, which is not always a pleasant experience: the more you
use something, the more you hate it ;-) But I think it's worth.

Of course, by no means I want to force anyone to learn Rust, I totally
understand people who want to see zero Rust. Just want to say the
maintain burden may exist any way, and the Rust binding is actually the
thing to help here.

Boqun
