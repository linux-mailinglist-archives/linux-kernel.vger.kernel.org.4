Ok, I understand better now. Agreed it shouldn't make a difference, but 
this is actually a limitation of the spi controller I'm using (spi-fsi). 
The controller cannot handle multiple transfers keeping the chip select 
enabled... I guess the driver can batch transfers in the message to get 
around this, unless you want to add a flag for that behavior.

Yep, this is also an artifact of the spi-fsi driver having different 
transfer size limits for writes and reads. Funnily enough the at25 
driver doesn't truly respect the max transfer size (it doesn't include 
the write command and address bytes in the calculation against the max 
transfer size) so that's how this worked previously.

Thanks!

Eddie
