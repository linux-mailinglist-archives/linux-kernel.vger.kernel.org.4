Even if the demotion path is not really required at the moment we should
keep in mind future potential extensions. E.g. when a userspace based
balancing is to be implemented because the default behavior cannot
capture userspace policies (one example would be enforcing a
prioritization of containers when some container's demoted pages would
need to be demoted further to free up a space for a different
workload).

Loops could be avoid by properly specifying from and to nodes if this is
going to be a fine grained interface to control demotion.
