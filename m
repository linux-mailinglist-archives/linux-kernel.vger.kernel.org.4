I don't think we need detailed performance numbers, but we need
something like:

  - "msi_remap=off" improves interrupt handling performance by
    avoiding the VMD MSI-X domain interrupt handler

  - But "msi_remap=on" is needed when ...?

This commit log doesn't outline any of those other scenarios, and it
doesn't say anything about when "msi_remap=on" or "msi_remap=off"
would be necessary or desired, so I have no idea how users are
supposed to figure out whether or not to use this parameter.

That's kind of a problem.  I'm not in favor of something failing and
the user having to debug it via dmesg.  That causes user frustration
and problem reports.

I don't know what "guest passthrough mode" is.  Can you detect that
automatically?
