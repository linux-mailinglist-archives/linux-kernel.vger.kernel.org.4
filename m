But if we ensure BTF only encodes consistent representations of
functions and spots optimized-out parameters, wouldn't the presence
in BTF of an .isra function provide a guarantee parameters are not 
optimized out? Note I'm not suggesting changing "kprobe/" or "fentry/"
semantics here, but rather having other dedicated SEC() prefixes to
support "try for foo, but fall back to foo.isra if attach to foo fails,
and we can find foo in BTF".

Right, I should have been clearer on this; the single-threaded case isn't
right either, it just picks the first instance of a function it finds.

I took that approach with

https://github.com/acmel/dwarves/commit/80eaecdb00b3d79becc2133b854593277093b115

Static functions with inconsistent prototypes are left out of
BTF encoding. Given that the numbers here are pretty low (around 
100 or so, not including .isra functions which have inconsistent 
prototypes due to optimizations), that seems to be the simplest
solution for now.

It seems workable technically, but I wonder how much benefit it
provides? The absolute number of static functions with conflicting
prototypes is small (around 100), and the usability of the above
would be hard to get right. My suggestion would be that if we
can ensure that BTF encoding will not encode inconsistent static
function representations, we could potentially do something like
the following on attach:

- a BPF program specifies "fentry/foo"
- we find a representation of foo in BTF
- we notice that there are multiple instances of foo in kallsyms
- because we know BTF would not have encoded foo if these had
  inconsistent prototypes, we can safely attach to all those
  instances

This seems to provide the least surprise for the user; i.e.
I attached to a function, and my program fired when it ran. If
the function has inconsistent representations, it isn't present
in BTF so we cannot attach safely.

Right, the only question is when we eliminate the inconsistencies
(prior to BTF dedup or during it).

We need the mechanics for comparing static functions to handle the .isra
case, so I went with re-using that scheme to catch inconsistent static
functions in
