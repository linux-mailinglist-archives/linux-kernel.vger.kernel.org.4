That's not quite what the commit log says.  The 8fd4391ee717
assumption is that on arm64,

  - _CRS *consumer* resources are host bridge registers
  - _CRS *producer* resources are windows

which I think matches the intent of the ACPI spec.

I assume you're saying the use of Memory32Fixed for a window is a
firmware defect, right?

(Per ACPI r6.5, sec 19.6.83, the Memory32Fixed descriptor cannot
specify a Producer/Consumer ResourceUsage.  I think that means the
space is assumed to be ResourceConsumer.)

Since this is a Windows laptop, I assume this works with Windows and
that Windows will in fact assign BARs in that Memory32Fixed area.

If we knew what the firmware author's intent was, we could probably
make Linux understand it.

Maybe (probably) Windows treats these descriptors the same on arm64 as
on x86, i.e., *everything* in PNP0A03 _CRS is assumed to be "producer"
(at least, that's my experimental observation; I have no actual
knowledge of Windows).

So I guess 8fd4391ee717 must have been motivated by some early arm64
platform that put "consumer" descriptors in PNP0A03 _CRS as Lorenzo
said [1].

In that case I guess our choices are:

  - Add quirks like this and keep adding them for every new arm64
    platform that uses the same "everything in PNP0A03 _CRS is a
    producer" strategy.

  - Remove 8fd4391ee717, break whatever early arm64 platforms needed
    it, and add piecemeal quirks for them.

I hate both, but I think I hate the first more because it has no end,
while the second is painful but limited.

Obviously we would need to do whatever we can to identify and fix
things that depend on 8fd4391ee717 before reverting it.
