I guess we still talk about different things. The code does not have a
binding for the boost, therefore it does not use boost binding. Whatever
it does with CS35L41_EXT_BOOST_NO_VSPK_SWITCH outside of DT, is not my
topic and I don't care.

That's why I asked folks to use strings for such enumerations, not
register values - to avoid any confusion between the code and bindings
(and also make it more readable for humans).

Best regards,
Krzysztof
