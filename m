This is a very good topic for LPC KVM Microconference.

Many thanks to Sean for ranting about something that only I was thinking
about before. Having host and guest be able to use PMU at the same time
in peace (hybrid profiling mode) is a very use-case worthy goal rather than
introducing exclusivity, and it's clear that kvm+perf lacks reasonable and
well-documented support when there is host perf user interference.
