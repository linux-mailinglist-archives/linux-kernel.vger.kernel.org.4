Look into the device_pm_wait_for_dev() API.  It's the appropriate thing 
to use when you want to wait for another device to complete a system PM 
transition.  (However, it's not appropriate for runtime PM.)

Of course, if there is a parent-child relationship between two devices 
then waiting is never necessary.  The PM core guarantees that a parent 
will always be at full power when a child changes its power state, 
unless pm_suspend_ignore_children() has been called for the parent 
device.
