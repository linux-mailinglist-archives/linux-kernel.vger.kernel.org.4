Thinking about it more, it may end up in vcpus with heterogeneous
capabilities (different SBI extension).
Most likely, it will be a bug and incorrect configuration from VMM but
it's a possibility.
For example: There will be two different scenarios for PMU extension

1. Boot vcpu disabled PMU extension - probably okay as guest queries
the PMU extension on boot cpu only.
The PMU extension won't be available for any other vcpu.

2. Boot vcpu has PMU extension enabled but others have it disabled.
The run time SBI PMU calls will
fail with EOPNOTSUPP and the user gets confused.

There will be similar cases for HSM extension as well.

As the entire extension won't be available to the guest if the SBI
extension is disabled for the boot cpu only.
There is also a slow VM start issue Andrew pointed about earlier.

This makes me think if a VM ioctl to disable/enable the SBI extension
for all vcpus makes more sense in this case.
