We decided to rely on strict type match when we introduced 'struct nf_conn___init',
but with that we twisted the C standard to, what looks to be, a wrong direction.

For definition:
struct nf_conn___init {
   struct nf_conn ct;
};
if a kfunc accepts a pointer to nf_conn it should always accept a pointer to nf_conn__init
for both read and write, because in C that's valid and safe type cast.

We can fix this design issue by saying that '___init' suffix is special and
C type casting rules don't apply to it.
In all other cases bpf_cpumask/cpumask would should allow it.

__ro suffix idea will keep moving us into further discrepancies with C.
