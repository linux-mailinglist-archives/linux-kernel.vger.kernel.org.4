A compile time error may be somewhat misleading as one would
suspect the issue is with a missing include or something along
those lines, even though the issue is with the inline assembly.

Wouldn't we need to check the GAS version instead of the GCC
version? AFAIU GAS version isn't known at compile time so a version
check may not make sense here for GCC.
