Like it is written in presentation, the standard way of doing it is done
by VFIO live migration feature, where 2K+ VMs are migrated to another server
at the time first server is scheduled for maintenance.

However, even in live update case mentioned in the presentation, you
should disable ALL PFs/VFs and enable ALL PFs/VFs at the same time,
so you don't need per-VF id enable knob.

Our devices (and Intel too) support many VFs too. The thing is that
servers are unlikely to be able to support 10 physical devices with 2K+
VFs. There are many limitations that will make such is not usable.
Like, global MSI-X pool and PCI bandwidth to support all these devices.

It should come with relevant driver changes and very strong justification why
such functionality is needed now and can't be achieved by anything else
except user-facing sysfs.

I don't see anything in this presentation and discussion that supports
need of such UAPI.
