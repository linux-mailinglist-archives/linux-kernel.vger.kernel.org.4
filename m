Bjorn, great catch, thank you!

I suspect you're actually onto the core of the problem. Looking
through various other drivers that implement _pcie_valid_device they
all appear to file similar restrictions on scanning for devices. The
drivers are all similar enough that I am starting to suspect they are
all running some version of the same bugged IP. Then I came across
advk_pcie_pio_is_running() in pci-aardvark.c, which describes our
issue pretty spot on including the same exact SError. Interestingly
enough they made a TF-A patch [3] to catch and handle the error
without ever passing it to the kernel. Other limitations they added
are ensuring reads are not attempted while the link is down.
pci-aardvark.c also implements limitations on Completion Retry Status.
It has given me ideas for solving the problem.

Very Respectfully,
Peter Geis
