Thanks for the explanation!

I thought the mmap_sem said was "&EXT4_I(inode)->i_mmap_sem".

But here are some more questions:

1) In the arch code page fault is handled by mmap_read_lock(mm) to get the
    shared lock, why would this lead to ABBA deadlock?

2) Why would page fault be triggered in the write process?

Could you explain it in more detail?

Looking forward to hearing from you! 🤔
