There is a clear need for further discussion and until then we do not
want to expose interface and create dependencies that will inevitably
hard to change the semantic later.

Yes, demoted patches are indeed counted as reclaimed but that is not a
major issue because from the external point of view charges are getting
reclaimed. It is nodes specification which makes the latent problem much
more obvious.

That is clear and the aim of the revert is not to disallow those
usecases. We just need a clear and futureproof interface for that.
Changing the semantic after the fact is a nogo, hence the revert.

There cannot be any regression with the revert now because the code
hasn't been upstream.

So let's remove the interface until we can agree on the exact semantic
and build the interface from there.
