Makes, sense, I guess what I missed here in the first place is the fact
that those DL tasks want to run 100%.

Correct.

What I didn't understand was this `GRUB-PA` and `the spare reclaimed
bandwidth is used to clock down frequency` in relation to GRUB task
runtime depreciation.

But now I think I get it. `GRUB-PA` means that in case we run with the
schedutil CPUfreq governor, the CPU frequency is influenced by Uact
(rq->dl.running_bw) via:

sugov_get_util() -> effective_cpu_util() -> cpu_bw_dl() ->

      return rq->dl.running_bw * SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE) >> BW_SHIFT

and on top of this we do GRUB reclaiming for those SCHED_FLAG_RECLAIM
tasks, i.e. task runtime depreciation.

Correct.

My tests were wrong since I was using DL task with dl_runtime=3ms and
dl_period = 100ms with an actual runtime=3ms whereas your tasks probably
want to run 100%.

yes, it did, thanks!
