Isn't it the plan to just do a trylock in atomic contexts so that it 
won't get stuck spinning for the lock for an indeterminate amount of time?

Note that with the use of qspinlock in all the major arches, the impact 
of thundering herds of lockers are much less serious than before. There 
are certainly some overhead in doing multiple lock acquires and 
releases, but that shouldn't been too excessive.

I am all in for reducing lock hold time as much as possible as it will 
improve the response time.
