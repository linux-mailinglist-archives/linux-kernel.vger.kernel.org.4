If it's just the simple asm-offsets conflict that Mark mentioned, then that
sounds fine to me. However, patches 3-5 don't seem to have anything to do
with arm64 at all and I'd prefer those to go via other trees (esp. as patch
3 is an independent -stable candidate and the last one is a bpf selftest
change which conflicts in -next).

So I'll queue the first two in arm64 on a branch (or-next/ftrace) based
on trace-direct-v6.3-rc3.
