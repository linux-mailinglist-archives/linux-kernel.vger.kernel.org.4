The first patch of the series made it into the mainline kernel, but, it 
seems, the second one ("PCI: dwc: Add support for 64-bit MSI target 
address") did not. As of 6.2-rc6, it is still missing.

Was it intentionally dropped because of some issues or, perhaps, just by 
accident? If it was by accident, could you please queue it for inclusion 
into mainline again?

Support for 64-bit MSI target addresses is needed for some of our SoCs. 
I ran into a situation when there was no available RAM in ZONE_DMA32 
during initialization of PCIe host. Hence, dmam_alloc_coherent() failed 
in dw_pcie_msi_host_init() and initialization failed with -ENOMEM:

[    0.374834] dw-pcie 4000000.pcie0: host bridge /soc/pcie0@4000000 ranges:
[    0.375813] dw-pcie 4000000.pcie0:      MEM 
0x0041000000..0x004fffffff -> 0x0041000000
[    0.376171] dw-pcie 4000000.pcie0:   IB MEM 
0x0400000000..0x07ffffffff -> 0x0400000000
[    0.377914] dw-pcie 4000000.pcie0: Failed to alloc and map MSI data
[    0.378191] dw-pcie 4000000.pcie0: Failed to initialize host
[    0.378255] dw-pcie: probe of 4000000.pcie0 failed with error -12

Mainline kernel 6.2-rc6 was used in that test.

The hardware supports 64-bit target addresses, so the patch "PCI: dwc: 
Add support for 64-bit MSI target address" should help with this 
particular failure.

Thank you in advance.
