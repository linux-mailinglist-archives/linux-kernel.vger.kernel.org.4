Rate-limiting is per call location, so yes, if we only have one call
location, that would solve it.  It would also have the nice property
that all the output would be atomic so it wouldn't get mixed with
other stuff, and it might encourage us to be a little less wordy in
the output.

But I don't think we need output in a single step; we just need a
single instance of ratelimit_state (or one for CPER path and another
for native AER path), and that can control all the output for a single
error.  E.g., print_hmi_event_info() looks like this:

  static void print_hmi_event_info(...)
  {
    static DEFINE_RATELIMIT_STATE(rs, ...);

    if (__ratelimit(&rs)) {
      printk("%s%s Hypervisor Maintenance interrupt ...");
      printk("%s Error detail: %s\n", ...);
      printk("%s      HMER: %016llx\n", ...);
    }
  }

I think it's nice that the struct ratelimit_state is explicit and
there's no danger of breaking it when adding another printk later.

It *could* be per pci_dev, too, but I suspect it's not worth spending
40ish bytes per device for the ratelimit data.
