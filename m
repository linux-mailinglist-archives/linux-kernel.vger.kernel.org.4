 Usage Notes
 -----------
=20
 SMpro errmon driver creates the sysfs files for each error type.
-Example: ``error_core_ce`` to get Core CE error type.
+See :ref:`smpro_sysfs` for the list of errors and the corresponding
+sysfs files.
=20
-* If the error is absented, the sysfs file returns empty.
-* If the errors are presented, one each read to the sysfs, the oldest erro=
r will be returned and clear, the next read will be returned with the next =
error until all the errors are read out.
+* If there is no errors, the sysfs file is empty.
+* Otherwise, when errors occur, the oldest error
+  will be returned on sysfs file reading and cleared. The next read will
+  return the next error until all the errors are read out.
=20
-For each host error type, SMpro keeps a latest max number of errors. All t=
he oldest errors that were not read out will be dropped. In that case, the =
read to the corresponding overflow sysfs will return 1, otherwise, return 0.
-Example: ``overflow_core_ce`` to report the overflow status of Core CE err=
or type.
