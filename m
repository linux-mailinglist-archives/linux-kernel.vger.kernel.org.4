I think we either use this bandwidth option and calculate the max fps based on
that (basically the bandwidth divided by (image_size + some blanking factor)),
or we keep it simple and instead of going down two steps in fps we allow up to
60 fps up to 720p, then 30 fps for 1080p and 15 fps for 4k.

The fps values currently used are a bit outdated w.r.t. modern webcams, so
upgrading it wouldn't hurt. And this is a lot simpler than doing bandwidth
calculations.

Regards,
