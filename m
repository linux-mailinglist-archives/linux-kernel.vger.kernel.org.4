I see, though -EAGAIN doesn't look suitable at all.  The old retcode for
!vma case is -ENOENT, so I think we'd better keep using it if we want to
have this patch.

So this logic existed since the initial version of uffd-wp.  It has a good
thing that it strictly checks everything and it makes sense since uffd-wp
is per-vma attribute.  In short, the old code fails clearly.

While the new proposal is not: if -ENOENT we really have no idea what
happened at all; some ranges can be wr-protected but we don't know where
starts to go wrong.

Now I'm looking at the original problem..

 - Allocate memory of size 16 pages with PROT_NONE with mmap
 - Register userfaultfd
 - Change protection of the first half (1 to 8 pages) of memory to
   PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE. This breaks the memory area in two VMAs.
 - Now UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT_MODE_WP on the whole memory of 16 pages errors
   out.

Why the user app should wr-protect 16 pages at all?

If so, uffd_wp_range() will be ran upon a PROT_NONE range which doesn't
make sense at all, no matter whether the user is aware of vma concept or
not...  because it's destined that it's a vain effort.

So IMHO it's the user app needs fixing here, not the interface?  I think
it's the matter of whether the monitor is aware of mprotect() being
invoked.

In short, I hope we're working on things that helps at least someone, and
we should avoid working on things that does not have clear benefit yet.
With the WP_ENGAGE new interface being proposed, I just didn't see any
benefit of changing the current interface, especially if the change can
bring uncertainties itself (e.g., should we fail upon !uffd-wp vmas, or
should we skip?).

Thanks.  My understanding is that it would have been reported if it
affected any existing uffd-wp user.

Currently we do maintain PM_UFFD_WP even for swap entries, so if it was
written then I think we'll know even if the page was swapped out:

	} else if (is_swap_pte(pte)) {
		if (pte_swp_uffd_wp(pte))
			flags |= PM_UFFD_WP;
		if (pte_marker_entry_uffd_wp(entry))
			flags |= PM_UFFD_WP;

So it's working?

IIUC in your latest public version is not optimized, but I can check the
new version when it comes.
