Okay, I was completely wrong while I was replying to your original patch.
Should have looked at the code closer, my apologies.

What I missed is that pd_offline doesn't happen when the cgroup goes
offline. Please take a look at the following two commits:

 59b57717fff8 ("blkcg: delay blkg destruction until after writeback has finished")
 d866dbf61787 ("blkcg: rename blkcg->cgwb_refcnt to ->online_pin and always use it")

After the above two commits, ->pd_offline_fn() is called only after all
possible writebacks are complete, so it shouldn't allow mass escapes to
root. With writebacks out of the picture, it might be that there can be no
further IOs once ->pd_offline_fn() is called too as there can be no tasks
left in it and no dirty pages, but best to confirm that.

So, yeah, the original approach you took should work although I'm not sure
the patches that you added to make offline blkg to bypass are necessary
(that also contributed to my assumption that there will be more IOs on those
blkg's). Have you seen more IOs coming down the pipeline after offline? If
so, can you dump some backtraces and see where they're coming from?

Thanks.
