This is an issue for your QEMU code which has this set at 5 bytes.
Guess our handling of record lengths needs updating now we have two different
spec versions to support and hence these can have multiple lengths.

Btw, do you have an updated version of the QEMU patches you can share?
I was planning on just doing the AER type RAS stuff for the first pull this cycle
but given this set means we never reach that code I probably need to do QEMU
support for this and the stuff to support those all in one go - otherwise
no one will be able to test it :)  We rather optimistically have the OSC set
to say the OS can have control of these, but upstream code doesn't emulate
anything yet. Oops. Should have pretended the hardware was handling them
until we had this support in place in QEMU.
