With a nodemask you should be able to only reclaim by specifying
terminal memory tiers that do that, and leave out higher tiers that
demote.

That said, it would actually be nice if reclaim policy wouldn't have
to differ from demotion policy longer term. Ultimately it comes down
to mapping age to memory tier, right? Such that hot pages are in RAM,
warm pages are in CXL, cold pages are in storage. If you apply equal
presure on all tiers, it's access frequency that should determine
which RAM pages to demote, and which CXL pages to reclaim. If RAM
pages are hot and refuse demotion, and CXL pages are cold in
comparison, CXL should clear out. If RAM pages are warm, they should
get demoted to CXL but not reclaimed further from there (and rotate
instead).

Do we know what's preventing this from happening today? What's the
reason you want to control them independently?
