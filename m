Yeah, I smell a hardware bug in my code. I hate waiting in this way inside=
=20
the code, so it's usually wrong when you need to do something like that.

During my research, I also found this patch (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/sh=
ow_bug.cgi?id=3D2134177)=20
that provides a fix in another possibly cleaner way.

But I don't understand the reasoning behind it, so maybe I=20
haven't spent enough time thinking about it.

Mh, I can try to cherry-pick the commit and test it in my own test environm=
ent. Currently, I haven't been=20
able to test it due to a lack of hardware, but I'm seeking a way to obtain =
one.=20
Luckily, I have someone on the Manjaro arm team who can help me test it,=20
so I'll try to do that.

Cheers!
