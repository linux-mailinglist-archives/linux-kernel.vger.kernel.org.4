Drop the timestamps; they add clutter but not useful information.

Do we have a reason to believe that in general, using the first
matching entry is incorrect?  I don't see anything in the ACPI spec
(r6.5, sec 6.2.13) that sheds light on this.

Presumably this works on Windows, and I doubt Windows would have a
platform quirk for this, so I hypothesize that Windows treats _PRT
entries as assignments, and the last one rules.  Maybe Linux should
adopt that rule?
