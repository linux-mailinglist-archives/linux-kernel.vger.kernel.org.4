Note that the bare device_pm_wait_for_dev() is a bit risky though,
because in the sync case it will deadlock if dpm_list is not ordered
properly.

One of the things taken care of by device_link_add() is to ensure that
the ordering of dpm_list will reflect the dependency represented by
the given new device link.
