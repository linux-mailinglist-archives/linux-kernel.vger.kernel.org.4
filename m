Even in the long run I would always prefer a generic solution whenever it
is possible. Quirks are fine for issues that cant be solved in another way
or really require individual treatment.
While I agree that ERR is not a good choice for the "falling back to polli=
ng"
message I do not have a strong opinion on whether WARN, NOTICE or INFO is =
more
appropriate. Jarko seems to prefer WARN.

In the case that an interrupt storm cant be detected (since there might no=
t even
be one) I am fine with adding a quirk.

As I wrote above I prefer a generic solution whenever possible.
