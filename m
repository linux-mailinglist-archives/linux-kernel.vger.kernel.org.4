I don't think it's correct. You can just walk arbitrary structures and
obtain a normal PTR_TO_BTF_ID that looks seemingly ok to the verifier
but has no lifetime guarantees. It's a separate pre-existing problem
unrelated to your series [0]. PTR_UNTRUSTED is not set for those cases
currently.

So the argument to your bpf_task_acquire may already be freed by then.
This issue would be exacerbated in sleepable BPF programs, where RCU
read lock is not held, so some cases of pointer walking where it may
be safe no longer holds.

I am planning to clean this up, but I'd still prefer if we don't allow
this helper in sleepable programs, yet. kptr_get is ok to allow.
Once you have explicit BPF RCU read sections, sleepable programs can
take it, do loads, and operate on the RCU pointer safely until they
invalidate it with the outermost bpf_rcu_read_unlock. It's needed for
local kptrs as well, not just this. I plan to post this very soon, so
we should be able to fix it up in the current cycle after landing your
series.

__rcu tags in the kernel will automatically be understood by the
verifier and for the majority of the correctly annotated cases this
will work fine and not break tracing programs.

Yeah, but the CT API doesn't assume validity of random PTR_TO_BTF_ID,
it requires KF_TRUSTED_ARGS which forces them to have ref_obj_id != 0.

Swapping out is not a problem if the object is RCU protected (which
again, is a requirement for kptr_ref if you wish to support kptr_get,
otherwise it's not needed).

The double pointer ugliness is to allow sleepable programs to safely
do the rcu_dereference/READ_ONCE inside the rcu_read_lock that the
kptr_get helper holds. In non-sleepable programs RCU read lock is
already held, so technically we can just load and pass it to
refcount_inc_not_zero and make it work.

All of this stuff will be gone once we have explicit BPF RCU read
sections, the kptr will be tagged __rcu and while it won't work with
all helpers but those that can deal with refcount == 0, it would be
safer to operate on compared to the PTR_UNTRUSTED case (like the
normal load is right now for kptr_ref), and it also makes it easier to
rely on data read from the object.
