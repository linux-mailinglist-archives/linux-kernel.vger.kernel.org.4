I'd recommend clearing only PCI_EXP_DEVSTA_FED in PCI_EXP_DEVSTA.

As for PCI_EXP_DPC_RP_PIO_STATUS, PCIe r6.1 sec 2.9.3 says that
during DPC, either UR or CA completions are returned depending on
the DPC Completion Control bit in the DPC Control register.
The kernel doesn't touch that bit, so it will contain whatever value
the BIOS has set. It seems fine to me to just clear all bits in
PCI_EXP_DPC_RP_PIO_STATUS, as you've done in your patch.

However, the RP PIO Status register is present only in Root Ports
that support RP Extensions for DPC, per PCIe r6.1 sec 7.9.14.6.
So you need to constrain that to "if (pdev->dpc_rp_extensions)".

I think you need to follow the procedure in dpc_reset_link().

That function first waits for the link to go down, in accordance with
PCIe r6.1 sec 6.2.11:

	if (!pcie_wait_for_link(pdev, false))
	...

Note that the link should not come back up due to a newly hot-added
device until DPC Trigger Status is cleared.

The function then waits for the Root Port to quiesce:

	if (pdev->dpc_rp_extensions && dpc_wait_rp_inactive(pdev))
	...

And only then does the function clear DPC Trigger Status.

You definitely need to wake_up_all(&dpc_completed_waitqueue) because
pciehp may be waiting for DPC Trigger Status to clear.

And you need to "clear_bit(PCI_DPC_RECOVERED, &pdev->priv_flags)"
before calling wake_up_all().

Huh, is PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_HPS not set on the hotplug port in question?

If it's not set, why do you get Surprise Down Errors in the first place?

How do you bring down the slot without surprise-removal capability?
Via sysfs?

Quite the opposite!  If it's not set, return false.
