Can't agree more.
I also agree that the whole pcpu stock draining code can be enhanced,
but I believe we should go into the direction almost directly opposite
to what's being proposed here.

Can we please return to the original problem which the patchset aims to solve?
Is it the latency introduced by execution of draining works on isolated cpus?
Maybe schedule these works with a delay and cancel them if the draining
occurred naturally during the delay?

Thanks!
