Ah, of course, I should add: this is not the usual case, most of the
time, users (e.g. a real driver) can help the design, I was just trying
to say: without the wisdom of maintainers and active developers, a Rust
binding solely designed by one user could have some design issues. In
other words, the experience of maintaining C side API is very valuable
to design Rust bindings.
