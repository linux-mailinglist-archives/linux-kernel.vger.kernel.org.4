64KiB was really low, while the theoretically possible max was
32*32*512 = 512KB, so I understand there used to be such requests :)

Here, by setting the max to 64x128*512, I don't think we'll need more.
Even with a 8K screen (will such really exist and want a text console?)
the max 64x128 gets 128 characters on a single line, for soemthing like
36 lines. So I guess it's not worth adding yet another sysctl :)
