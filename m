If we want to change the behavior from today toward something that we 
think is the more common case for enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_VM, that works 
too.  If we fully remove VM_BUG_ON() in favor of VM_WARN_ON() + 
kernel.panic_on_warn=1, then anybody relying on getting kernel panics when 
they qualify new kernels with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM will start getting WARNINGs 
but not panics unless they are already using kernel.panic_on_warn.

I think that's fine, but is a change in behavior.  My use cases work both 
ways.  If we don't set the bit-1 behavior by default on CONFIG_DEBUG_VM 
then I just won't need to clear it.

I'm personally interested in (d) for debugging issues, but the intent of 
this patch was actually to allow for (b) too.  I want to deploy 
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM with WARN_ON_ONCE() behavior to a small set of production 
machines to catch latent kernel issues we don't know about, but without 
impacting the workloads.

That's also very valuable because I want to surface CONFIG_DEBUG_VM checks 
that would never get hit because we panic before it can be, just because 
of some other VM_BUG_ON().  Your idea of WARN_ON_ONCE() will be great for 
that because we can make forward progress and not be too spammy to the 
kernel log.

There seems to be some agreement in the thread for removing VM_BUG_ON() 
and friends in favor of VM_WARN_ON(), so I'll wait a couple days for 
anymore feedback and then send a patch along.

This seems like it will be very clean and allow for (b), which is great.
