Documentation/x86/boot.rst has a section on this (at the end), but we
should really stop using it. It is only implemented by out-of-tree
GRUB at the moment (last time I checked) and leaking all those struct
bootparams specific details into every bootloader is not great,
especially the ones that intend to be generic and boot any EFI OS on
any EFI arch.

Yes. But I should note that this is actually something that goes
outside of the EFI spec as well: 32-bit firmware can /load/ 64-bit
PE/COFF binaries but not *start* them.

Commit 97aa276579b28b86f4a3e235b50762c0191c2ac3 has some more
background. This is currently implement by 32-bit OVMF, and
systemd-boot.

That is the same thing. The EFI stub is what enables the kernel (or
decompressor) to masquerade as a PE/COFF executable.

In short, every EFI stub kernel on every architecture has a native
PE/COFF entry point that calls the EFI stub, and the EFi stub does the
arch-specific bootloader work and boots it.

In addition, the x86_64 EFI stub kernel has an extra, non-native
PE/COFF entry point, which is exposed in a way that is not covered by
the EFI spec, but which allows Linux specific loaders such as
systemd-boot to boot such kernels on 32-bit firmware without having to
do the whole struct bootparams dance in the bootloader.
