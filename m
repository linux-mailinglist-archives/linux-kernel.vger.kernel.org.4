Because?

Btw, for the future, you should make sure you add those commit authors
to Cc so that they can get a chance to comment. Adding the folks from
that commit to Cc.

What does that sentence mean exactly? The UE/CE auto clearing
functionality is not in that silicon?

I'm guessing that's this reg:

/* ECC control register */
#define ECC_CTRL_OFST                   0xC4

?

Aah, you mean that the ->get_error_info() functions are doing the
clearing even if something should be doing self clearing. And that
DDR_ECC_INTR_SELF_CLEAR thing is queried when enabling the error
interrupt which is just bad naming because it looks like that quirk
controls what register to write/read.

So what is this commit message of

  4bcffe941758 ("EDAC/synopsys: Re-enable the error interrupts on v3 hw")

then talking about:

"Then the interrupt handler will be called only once."

How is that interrupt supposed to be reenabled?

Aha, that sounds like the right thing to toggle.

"Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"
instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy to
do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its
behaviour."

In this case, pls formulate it something like this:

"So fix all these problems noted above: rename DDR_ECC_INTR_SELF_CLEAR
to SYNPS_ZYNQMP_IRQ_REGS to denote that, ..."

And so on.

Yes, that makes more sense.

If those are not publicly accessible, then there's no point to put them
in here.

Does this need to go to stable@ and thus older kernels?

That lock needs to be named properly and have a comment above it what it
protects.

How does this comment help here?

If it is available since a version number, why doesn't the below check a
version number? IOW, what is the relevance of that comment here?

In any case, I need to hear from this driver's maintainer too.

Thx.
