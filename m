The intention of this nf_conn___init was to be invisible to the user.
In selftests there is no trace of nf_conn___init. It is only for
enforcing semantics by virtue of type safety in the verifier.

Allocated but not inserted nf_conn -> nf_conn___init
Inserted/looked up nf_conn -> nf_conn

We can't pass e.g. nf_conn___init * to a function expecting nf_conn *.
The allocated nf_conn may not yet be fully initialized. It is only
after bpf_ct_insert_entry takes the nf_conn___init * and returns
inserted nf_conn * should it be allowed.

But for the user in BPF C it will be the same nf_conn. The verifier
can enforce different semantics on the underlying type's usage in
kfuncs etc, while the user performs normal direct access to the
nf_conn.

It will be the same case here, except you also introduce the case of
kfuncs that are 'polymorphic' and can take both. Relaxing
'strict_type_match' for that arg and placing the type of member you
wish to convert the pointer to gives you such polymorphism. But it's
not correct to do for nf_conn___init to nf_conn, at least not by
default.

In the future we may do:

union bpf_subtype {
  type A;
  type B;
  type C;
};

And using the relaxed rule allows all types at off = 0 to be passed to
kfuncs expecting type A/B/C for bpf_subtype *.
bpf_subtype is a fake type. We're just using the type system to
enforce different API usage for the same underlying kernel type.

I'm just saying the triple underscore is not visible to the user.
You can declare kfunc that is:
struct foo___x *foo_alloc(void); in the kernel as
struct foo *foo_alloc(void); in BPF program and avoid all the
casting/ugliness and still enforce semantics around use.
