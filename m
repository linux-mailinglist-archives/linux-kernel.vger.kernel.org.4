lspci -vvv seems to have no problem telling me about what PCI memory 
space is assigned where, even as an unprivileged user, so surely it's 
available to any VFIO user too?

It is not necessarily useful for eeh IOMMU layer to claim to userspace 
that an entire window is unusable if in fact there's nothing in there 
that would be treated as a P2P address so it's actually fine. As I say, 
iommu-dma can make that assumption for itself because iommu-dma doesn't 
need to maintain any particular address space layout, but it could be 
overly restrictive for a userspace process or VMM which does.

If the system has working ACS configured correctly, then this issue 
should be moot; if it doesn't, then a VFIO user is going to get a whole 
group of peer devices if they're getting anything at all, so it doesn't 
seem entirely unreasonable to leave it up to them to check that all 
those devices' resources play well with their expected memory map. And 
the particular case of a system which claims to have working ACS but 
doesn't, doesn't really seem to be something that can or should be 
worked around from userspace; if that switch can't be fixed, it probably 
wants an ACS quirk adding in the kernel.

Thanks,
Robin.
