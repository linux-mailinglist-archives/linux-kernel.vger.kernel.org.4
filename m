Sure; to clarify, I'm not against the overall idea of putting a hack in 
the SMMU driver with a big comment that it is a hack to work around 
missing notifications under SVA, but it would not constitute an "SMMU 
bug" to not do that. SMMU is just another VMSAv8-compatible MMU - if, 
say, KVM or some other arm64 hypervisor driver wanted to do something 
funky with notifiers to shadow stage 1 permissions for some reason, it 
would presumably be equally affected.

FWIW, the VT-d spec seems to suggest that invalidation on RO->RW is only 
optional if the requester supports recoverable page faults, so although 
there's no use-case for non-PRI-based SVA at the moment, there is some 
potential argument that the notifier issue generalises even to x86.

Thanks,
Robin.
