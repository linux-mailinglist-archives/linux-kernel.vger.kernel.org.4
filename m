I've said before (in different words) that using an existing platform
driver for hardware on a PCI card requires shims, which have been
strongly rejected by the Linux kernel.

I understand that this is a use case and a desire to implement a
solution for the use case.  But this is a very non-standard model.
The proposal exposes a bunch of hardware beyond the pci interface
in a non-pci method.

No, just no.  Respect the pci interface boundary and do not drag
devicetree into an effort to pierce and straddle that boundary
(by adding information about the card, beyond the PCI controller,
into the system devicetree).  Information about dynamically
discoverable hardware does not belong in the devicetree.
