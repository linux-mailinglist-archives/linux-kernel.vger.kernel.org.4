Not only multi threads, but also may be broken for shared pages. When
you do rmap walk, you may get multiple contradict mempolicy, which one
would you like to obey?

TBH I'm not sure whether such half-baked solution is worth it or not,
at least at this moment. The cost is not cheap, but the gain may not
be worth it IMHO.
