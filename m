Yes, this is a real problem.  I think the "walk all PCI devices
looking for one we like" approach is terrible because it breaks a lot
of driver model assumptions (no device ID to autoload module via udev,
hotplug doesn't work, etc), but we don't have a good alternative right
now.

I think portdrv is slightly better because at least it claims the
device in the usual way and gives a way for service drivers to
register with it.  But I don't really like that either because it
created a new weird /sys/bus/pci_express hierarchy full of these
sub-devices that aren't really devices, and it doesn't solve the
module load and hotplug issues.

I would like to have portdrv be completely built into the PCI core and
not claim Root Ports or Switch Ports.  Then those devices would be
available via the usual driver model for driver loading and binding
and for hotplug.
