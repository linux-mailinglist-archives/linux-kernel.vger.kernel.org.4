My concern with unified fakes having the same ops, stats, and context structs
is that they would couple the test suites together. I think it's better to
have multiple fakes, each with the single responsibility of providing minimal
support for the component under test. Otherwise, we would end up having
overcomplicated fakes that implement the union (in the set theory sense of
the term) of all behaviors tested by all suites. By using these fakes, some
test cases might implicitly exercise behaviors that are outside their scope
(e.g., the Region programming test case calling all Manager ops). I feel
this would go against the principle of limiting the amount of code under test
to a single unit. 
Thanks,
Marco
