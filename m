I think you missed this question.

Uh, well, OK, I guess I could dig through that and figure what what's
relevant.  I'd like the commit log to contain a hint of what the
problem looks like and some justification for why it should be
backported to stable.

I still look at Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst
occasionally to decide things like this, but I get the feeling that
it's a little out-of-date and more restrictive than current practice.

But I do think the "PF exists but VF disabled" situation needs to be
clarified somehow, too.
