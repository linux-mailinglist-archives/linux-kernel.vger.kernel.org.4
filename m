Hello Paul,

Thomas added new tests for vfprintf(), which is a good idea because it
was a new implementation, we use it a lot in the tests so we'd rather
make sure it works! This required to implement support for memfd_create()
that is used to collect the output into a buffer, as well as to complete
a little bit the minimalistic FILE emulation with fileno(), fdopen(),
fflush() and fclose(). The result is neat and works equally on glibc and
nolibc. We just had to cheat on the pointer test because for NULL nolibc
prints "0x0" while glibc prints "(nil)" so we check 0x1 instead to avoid
this special case.

Finally Thomas added a new target to the makefile to ease building the
test against the default libc. This should help detect incompatibilities
when new features are added.

I've tested it locally with my libc and against all supported architectures
(userland tests only), and all tests passed.

This can be added to your dev tree for 6.5 on top of the previous series.

Thanks!
Willy
