Sure. Lockless code is complicated.

Makes sense. There should be a good reason to use lockless code
because it is complicated to do it right and maintain.

I understand this. Well, it is always important to describe the
the reason why the barrier was added there. Even when it is wrong,
it gives a clue what was the motivation. Otherwise, it is hard
to do any changes on the code later.

I guess that it might be more problematic for you because
you probably are not the original author.

This makes sense. I did not think about the hotplug scenario.

Well, I suggest to move the barriers into the buddy code and describe
it there. It does not make sense to use the barriers for the perf
hardlockup.

I mean something like:

I do not have strong opinion. For me, the more important change is
to move watchdog_buddy_check_hardlockup() into
watchdog_hardlockup_kick(). watchdog_timer_fn() is already too complex.

Yes, this is much better.

It seems that s390 wanted to disable the watchdog completely, see
the commit  dea20a3fbdd08e5 ("[PATCH] Disable DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP for s390")
because they got too many false positives.

It would be nice but it might be problematic if we do not have
access to the hardware.

Renaming the config variables seems to be the best solution at the moment.
IMHO, it would be nice to have something like:

  + CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR for code shared by all hardlockup
    detectors

  + CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF for code using kernel/watchdog_perf.c

  + CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_BUDDY for code using
	  kernel/watchdog_buddy.c

  + HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF set by architectures that support
	  using kernel/watchdog_perf.c

  + HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH set by architectures that have
	alternative implementation of the hardlockup detector

  + CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PREFER_BUDDY
	Allow to prefer the buddy detector when _PERF or _ARCH
	is available as well.

  + HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_PANIC
  + HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_ALL_CPU_BACKTRACE
	set when the earchitecture support these features and
	used for the sysfs interface

I am not sure how complicated it would be to rename the config
variables to somehing sane. I am sorry I do not have time to
prepare the patches at the moment.

I'll let Andrew to decide if he would require this cleanup to accept
the patchset.
