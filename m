Could you explain what "sure-start" does?
Is it actually an attribute type of which multiple attributes can exist?

Or are there just some global properties that need to be exposed?
If it is global it should be directly under
/sys/class/firmware-attributes/*/authentication/
without needing the type.

Are these reindentations and other cleanups intentional?

If they are intentional and there are no interactions with your actual
patch you could split them into their own patch and submit them
separately.

This way we wouldn't have to worry about them here anymore.

Note:
These indentations are different from the newly introduced documentation.

How to interpret each log entry?

If it is an opaque thing from the firmware that would also be useful to
know.

Will log entry size always be 16? Or can it be bigger in the future when
more bytes are used?
This should be mentioned.

Is audit_log_entry_count ever used without reading audit_log_entries
right after?
If not the count file could be dropped.

How are these bits to be interpreted?

Is " (base64)" supposed to be part of the contents of the file?

This documentation should contain enough information to understand the
files contents.


I understand that one WMI call will return all the fields that are part
of the "status" and "statusbin" in one response.

Are these WMI calls especially expensive or called especially
frequently?

If not I would still argue to split them into one file per field and
remove the statusbin file.

It is much more intuitive to read for example the KEK from the file
"kek" where it is also updated from.

This interface will be used by various applications and it is much
easier to read simple files than having to parse single fields from
bespoke text or binary files.
