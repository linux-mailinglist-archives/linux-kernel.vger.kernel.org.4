If there isn't, there will be in in the next week or so, if we can
stay on schedule.  Otherwise, I fear that Casey Schaufler, who I
believe is holding his breath, may turn irretrievably blue.... :-)

The Trust Orchestration System, Quixote, that we are releasing for
Linux uses PCR23 to generate an attestation of the functional state
value for an internally modeled security domain.

TSEM, the LSM based kernel component in all of this, supports the
ability to implement multiple 'domains', nee namespaces, each of which
can have a security modeling function attached to it.  Each internally
modeled domain has to have the ability to independently attest the
functional value of the security model implemented for the
domain/namespace.

We have found, and I believe others will find that, particularly the
resettable registers, are too precious to be constrained from general
usage.  We actually just finished lifting the PCR23 extension
functionality out of the TSEM driver and into userspace because having
it in the kernel was too constraining.

With respect to making the behavior a command-line option.  We've
slogged through 2+ years of conversations with sizable players who
have indicated that if the 'distys' don't implement something, it
isn't a relevant Linux technology, so a command-line option poses a
barrier to innovation.
