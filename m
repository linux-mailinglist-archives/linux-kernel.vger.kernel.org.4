Scheduled how? Is this callbacks doing queue_work() or something?

Anyway; the thinking is that by passing off the callbacks on NOHZ, the
idle CPUs stay idle. By running the callbacks before going full idle,
all work is done and you can stay idle longer.

All my dev boxes are headless :-) I don't thinkt he ADL even has X or
wayland installed.

I can try; but as of now turbostat doesn't seem to work on that thing at
all. I think localyesconfig might've stripped a required bit. I'll poke
at it later.
