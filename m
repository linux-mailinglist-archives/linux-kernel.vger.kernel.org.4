It is dependent first of all of having the LRU struct with the
unreclaimable/reclaimable lists. Which means it requires storing the
enclave pointer in the page as well. It's dependent on knowing how many
pages are available, being able to ignore the age of a page etc. Right
now, without cgroups, sgx will be unable to allocate memory when an
enclave is created if it cannot reclaim enough memory from the existing
in use enclaves.

Aside from that though, I don't think that killing enclaves makes sense
outside the context of cgroup limits. Without cgroup limits, you have a
max number of EPC pages that you can have active at any one time. If an
enclave attempts to allocate a new page and the reclaimer can't free up
any, how would you decide whether it's ok to kill an entire enclave in
order to grant this other enclave the higher priority for getting a
page? With a cgroup limit, the system owner explicitly can decide what
the limits on usage will be, but without that, you'd have a situation
where one new enclave could kill others I would think. Better to just
have it the way it is - new page allocations fail if there are not free
pages, but you don't kill enclaves that already exist.
