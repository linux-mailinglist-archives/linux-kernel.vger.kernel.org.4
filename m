My preference is "KVM x86", but I don't have a super strong opinion.  I def=

don't think it's necessary to strictly match the MAINTAINERS file.

More or less.  The majority of urgent and critical fixes should target the =
current
release, and the "soft" qualifier on "soft close" covers the rest.  Ah, but=
 this
section doesn't say anything about fixes that target mainline.  I'll add a =

to explicitly talk about fixes.

I didn't follow this question.  Are you asking if we should have "KVM: x86/=
hyperv:"?
If so, my answer is "probably not".  The Hyper-V code isn't as isolated as =
the Xen
code and much of it is vendor specific, e.g. I would rather Hyper-V changes=
 that
primarily touch vmx.c be tagged "KVM: VMX" as it's possible, however unlike=

non-Hyper-V users could be affected.=20

I don't want to introduce "emulator" as I don't think there will be a high =
enough
volume of patches to benefit from the extra qualifier, the emulator isn't a=
s isolated
as we like to think it is, and because KVM does a lot of emulation outside =
of the
emulator.  E.g. enter_smm() doesn't flow through emulate.c, but emulator_le=
ave_smm()
_only_ gets invoked via the emulator.

Similar to Hyper-V, I'm hesitant to introduce x86/apic as many "APIC" chang=
es are
actually in vendor specific code, e.g. much of APICv, AVIC, IPI virtualizat=
ion, etc.
I'm definitely not opposed to using x86/apic for local and and maybe even I=
/O APIC
changes though.

Hmm.  Sort of.  In a perfect world where everyone has unlimited time, then =
testing
a inside a nested VM would be encouraged.  But practically speaking, doing =
basic
testing of a feature in a nested VM doesn't buy all that much meaningful co=
verage,
and can even give a false sense of security.

The things we tend to get wrong are the edge cases, error handling, etc., a=
nd those
are unlikely to be excercised by basic testing, i.e. really need dedicated =
tests.
And if we have dedicated tests, then nested is covered by "Running selftest=
s and KUT
are mandatory".

At least for official documentation, I think I would prefer not to explicit=
ly
encourage people to use their time booting and testing in nested VMs.

I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea of "RFT", but until it's a ubiquito=
us
and/or formally documented tag I would prefer to avoid using RFT KVM x86.

For the overwhelming majority of changes where "I couldn't test this" is le=
gitimate
_and_ the series/patch isn't tagged RFC, I have access to the necessary har=
dware.
For the few cases where I don't have hardware, I don't mind hunting down so=
meone
who does.  I.e. blasting "RFT to everyone isn't necessary.

In other words, I think we'll spend more time explaining and trying to unde=
rstand
the use of RFT than we would benefit from using it to identify when a serie=
s needs
extra testing.

I _really_ don't want to add that qualifier.  Code coverage is but one aspe=
ct of
testing, and it's not even #1 priority, e.g. exercising code that violates =
architectural
behavior means nothing if the test doesn't detect the error.  I.e. the purp=
ose of
tests isn't _just_ to ensure good code coverage.

No, just tests.  This is specifically talking about non-public workloads.  =
If a
detailed reproduction sequence _doesn't_ involve writing code, i.e. a test,=
 then
the fix should simply provider the reproducer.

If you're talking about the sequence of events in KVM that result in the bu=
g,
then that info belongs in the changelog and is largely covered by the tip t=
ree
handbook.

Honest question, why not?

Calling out a specific developer is one thing, but I don't see the harm in =
adding
what essentially amounts to an extra requirement for Google employees.

No, because at that point it's just the guest attacking the host.  This sni=
