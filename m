I think it's okay to stick with the multi-policy code for the initial
submission, you've got the code now, and it's tested.  I just wanted
to make sure there were plans to make use of it at some point, if not
we might as well drop it now.  However, it sounds like you've got a
plan to utilize the multi-policy support so that's fine with me.
