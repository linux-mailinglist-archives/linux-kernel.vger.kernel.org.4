Sorry, maybe I should understand this way:

In theroy, KVM shall not modify guest VMX MSRs in response to the guest CPUID
updates. Therefore we shall not enforce the exposure of a feature in guest VMX
MSR, just because it is enabled in guest CPUID (e.g., userspace VMM can choose
to hide such feature so long as it believes KVM can not provide correct nested
support for this feature). 

But in reverse, it is not reasonable for userspace VMM to expose a feature in
guest VMX MSR settings, if such feature is disabled in this guest's CPUID. So
KVM shall help to make sure such feature is hidden when guest CPUID changes.


BTW, I found my previous understanding of what vmx_adjust_secondary_exec_control()
currently does was also wrong. It could also be used for EXITING controls. And
for such flags(e.g., SECONDARY_EXEC_RDRAND_EXITING), values for the nested settings
(vmx->nested.msrs.secondary_ctls_high) and for the L1 execution controls(*exec_control)
could be opposite. So the statement:
	"1> For now, what vmx_adjust_secondary_exec_control() does, is to enable/
	 disable a feature in VMX MSR(and nVMX MSR) based on cpuid changes."
is wrong.

Hopefully we are gonna change vmx_adjust_secondary_exec_control() soon...
