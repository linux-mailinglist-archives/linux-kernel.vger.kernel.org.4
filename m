I think it is because *init_net* which is not allocated from slab meant
its address does not belong to linear mapping addresses on arm64. =
However,
virt_to_page() is only applicable to linear mapping addresses. So,
mem_cgroup_from_slab_obj() is not sufficient. mem_cgroup_from_obj() is =
used
in this case, which will use vmalloc_to_page() for the page associated
with *init_net*. If Vasily does not want to bring commit 1d0403d20f6c =
back,
this patch LGTM. Otherwise, let's wait for Vasily.

Thanks.
