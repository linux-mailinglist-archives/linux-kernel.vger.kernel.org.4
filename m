This becomes an incompatible change to the GHCB specification.

On the hypervisor side, the certificate blob can be replaced at any time 
with a new blob that is larger. So you may still have to handle the case 
where you get a SNP_GUEST_REQ_INVALID_LEN even if you previously asked before.

I think having the sev-guest driver re-issue the request with the internal 
buffer when it receives SNP_GUEST_REQ_INVALID_LEN is the better way to go. 
You could still cache the size request and always return that to 
user-space when a request is received with a 0 length. The user-space 
program must be able to handle receiving multiple 
SNP_GUEST_REQ_INVALID_LEN in succession anyway, because of the fact that 
the hypervisor can be updating the certs asynchronously. And if you get a 
request that is not 0 length, then you issue it as such and re-use the 
logic of the first 0 length request that was received if you get an 
SNP_GUEST_REQ_INVALID_LEN with the user-space supplied value.

Peter, is this something you could change the patch to do?

And the first caller will have received an -EAGAIN in order to 
differentiate between the two situations?
