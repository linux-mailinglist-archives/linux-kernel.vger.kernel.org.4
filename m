I can't drop this modification because what is currently done with the
generic resource names much worse. Most importantly the generic names
suggested here are also added to the driver in the framework of this
patchset. So one way or another these new names need to be
added to the DT-bindings.

As I already said many times we need to find a solution which would
suit both of us. For me it's to add the new names with detailed
description and if possible restrict the non-standard resource names
usage. For you it's to implement a suitable named properties
constraints. At the same time you keep pushing only what you need
without concerning what is required for this patchset to be coherent
in accordance with the new functionality.

I've listed all the possible options in this message:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220619163727.xjdlx2jf565uhids@mobilestation/
I asked you many times to pay your attention to it, but you kept
ignoring these requests so I had to resubmit the series after waiting
more than two months for your response. Please let's find out a
solution which would suit both of us this time.

So you don't like having the "definitions" keyword in the DT-schemas.
Do you? Ok. I'll just move all the names defined in there right in the
named properties constraints. But in any case since these are the
common DT-schemas we are talking about we can't expect the names being
specified in a fixed order since at the very least some of them can be
absent in particular device implementation. What do you say on this?
Do you have any alternative solution I miss?
