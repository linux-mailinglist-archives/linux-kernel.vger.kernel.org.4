Sure, I wouldn't require that for your series though fwiw.

Yep as long as the ref is decremented on map destroy and elem delete
all good.

No not arguing it shouldn't be possible just didn't see the release
hook.

Yep I found the dtor() gets populated in btf.c and apparently needed
to repull my local tree because I missed it. Thanks for the detailed
response.

And last thing I was checking is because KF_SLEEPABLE is not set
this should be blocked from running on sleepable progs which would
break the call_rcu in the destructor. Maybe small nit, not sure
its worth it but might be nice to annotate the helper description
with a note, "will not work on sleepable progs" or something to
that effect.

Thanks.
