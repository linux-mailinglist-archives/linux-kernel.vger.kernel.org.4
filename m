Do we expect it to be added any time soon or it's caused by some system
limitations?

I agree, but it's probably better to reflect it in a form of a per-memcg
thp split failure counter (e.g. in memory.stat), not as swap out failures.
Overall option a) looks preferable to me. Especially if in the long run
the arm64 limitation will be fixed.

I'm not sure about this option: I can easily imagine a setup with a
memcg-specific swap space, which would require setting an artificial
memory.swap.max to get the fail counter working. On the other side not a deal
breaker.

Thanks!
