Your response was a multi-part message, which doesn't work on the
Linux mailing lists.  See http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html

This would actually have been "v2", since you sent v1 previously.

This kind of information needs to be in the commit log, not just in
the email thread.

It's best if there is a published errata document from Qualcomm that
describes the issue and how software should work around it.  Obviously
a URL to that document would be in the commit log.

Not quite done.  Needs to be like this:

  /*
   * Text ...
   */

Not like this:

  /* Text ...
   */

Some of this history or at least a pointer to it should be in the
commit log.

It's hard to guarantee that this will only be used in Chromebook, so
this is a little weak.  But if it's the best we have, it needs to be
mentioned in the code comment.
