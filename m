Hello, I have never had it come up with only 2 lanes, I get 4 consistently.
I have it connected through a M.2 to female PCIe 16x (4x electrically
connected),
then through a male-to-male PCIe 4x cable with TX/RX swap, then through a
16x extender. All three cables are approx 25cm. It seems stable.

This might be worth investigating, I'll look into it, but it seems
many of the EP
drivers don't have a Linkup notifier,
drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pci-dra7xx.c has
one, but most of the other EP drivers don't have them, so it might not be
absolutely required.

I am also working on an NVMe driver but I have our NVMe firmware running in
userspace so our endpoint function driver only exposes the BARs as UIO
mapped memory and has a simple interface to generate IRQs to host / initiat=
e
DMA transfers.

So that driver does very little in itself and I still have problems
with the BARs
getting unmapped (reset to 0) randomly. I hope your patches for monitoring
the IRQs will shed some light on this. I also observed the BARs getting res=
et
with the pcie ep test function driver, so I don't think it necessarily
is the function
that is to blame, rather the controller itself (also because none of
the kernel code
should / does access the BARs registers @0xfd80'0010).

Thank you for these patches. I will try them and see if they give me more i=
nfo.

Also, I will delay the release of the v3 of my patch series because of
these issues.
The v3 only incorporates the changes discussed here in the mailing list so =
your
version should be up to date. If you want me to send you the series in
its current
state let me know.

But I will need some more debugging, I'll release the v3 when the driver is=
 more
stable. I don't when, I don't have that much time on this project. Thanks f=
or
your understanding.

Rick
