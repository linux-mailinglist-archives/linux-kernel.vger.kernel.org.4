Yup. And a "Link:" with the url to the report is missing as well (Linus
wants those, automatic regression tracking needs those [IOW: if they are
missing it causes me trouble, that's why I care], and the docs explain
this as well).

That's why I asked for those two tags, but I didn't even get a reply:

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
