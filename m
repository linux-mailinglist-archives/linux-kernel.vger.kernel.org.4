No, we don't.

Think about it this way: kexec() is modifying persistent (across kexec)
state to get the system ready for the new kernel.  The caches are
persistent state.  Devices have persistent state.  Memory state persists
across kexec().  The memory integrity metadata persists.

What persistent state does a conversion to KeyID-0 affect?  It resets
the integrity metadata and the memory contents.

Kexec leaves memory contents in place and doesn't zero them, so memory
contents don't matter.  The integrity metadata also doesn't matter
because the memory will be used as KeyID-0 and that KeyID doesn't read
the integrity metadata.

What practical impact does a conversion back to KeyID-0 serve?  What
persistent state does it affect that matters?

That would be nice.
