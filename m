Subject: My TP-Link EX510 AX3000 Dual-Band Gigabit Wi-Fi 6 Router has a pap=
er notice on GNU General Public License

Good day from Singapore,

I have terminated my M1 ISP fiber home broadband with effect from 11 Mar 20=
23 Saturday because I need to pay about SGD$42 per month. My M1 fiber broad=
band contract ends on 11 Mar 2023.

Instead I have subscribed to Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) Ho=
me Access program. This program is for EXTREMELY POOR FAMILIES in Singapore=
 who are living in HDB PUBLIC RENTAL HOUSING PROGRAM. People who live in HD=
B Public Rental Flats (like myself) have very little money in their bank ac=
counts and cannot afford to buy even the smallest HDB BTO 2-room apartment =
in Singapore. Because even the monies in our Central Provident Fund (CPF) a=
ccounts are mediocre/super low.

The participating ISP in the IMDA Home Access Program is MyRepublic. Under =
the IMDA Home Access program, I only need to pay SGD$14 per month for my fi=
ber home broadband.

MyRepublic ISP has also given me a *FREE* TP-Link EX510 AX3000 Dual-Band Gi=
gabit Wi-Fi 6 Router on 10 Mar 2023 Friday. MyRepublic fiber broadband line=
 was also activated on the same day. Inside the packaging box there is a pa=
per notice on GNU General Public License.

I believe my tp-link Wi-Fi 6 wireless router is most likely running on an o=
pen source Linux operating system.=20

How can I find out what version of the Linux Kernel it is running on? I thi=
nk only Linux kernel 6.x support Wi-Fi 6. Am I right?

By the way, I live in a HDB 2-room RENTAL apartment in Ang Mo Kio Singapore=
.

Thank you.
