Yes, I do agree with that. Demotion is a part of the aging. I meant to say
that the result of the operation should be reclaimed charges but that
doesn't mean that demotion is not a part of that process.

I am mostly concerned about demote only behavior that Mina is targetting
and want to use memory.reclaim interface.

From the external visibility POV the major difference between the two is
that the reclaim decreases the overall charged memory. And there are
pro-active reclaim usecases which rely on that. Demotion is mostly
memory placement rebalancing. Sure still visible in per-node stats and
with implications to performance but that is a different story.

Yes. We have already had requests for per node limits in the past. And I
do expect this will show up as a problem here as well but with a
reasonable memory.reclaim and potentially memory.demote interfaces the
balancing and policy making can be outsourced to the userspace .

Just to make sure I am on the same page. This means that if a node mask
is specified then it always implies demotion without any control over
how the demotion is done, right?

IMO this is rather constrained semantic which will completely rule out
some potentially interesting usecases. E.g. fine grained control over
the demotion path or enforced reclaim for node balancing. Also if we
ever want a promote interface then it would better fit with demote
counterpart.

Yes, this is what I am inclining to as well.
