But what do net subsystem guys know about this? Have you had a chance

So, do I understand correct the following?
There is a PoE PSE which has a proprietary user space driver and to make it
work reliably we have to add a quirk which utilizes the GPIO sysfs?

That user space driver is using what from the kernel? GPIO sysfs?

Sorry for being unhelpful here. But without understanding the issue we can't
propose better solutions.
