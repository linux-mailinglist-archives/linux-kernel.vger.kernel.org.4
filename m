Since we're updating the comment anyway, let's clean up the "slot"
language here.  The PCIe spec doesn't use "slot" in the context of the
bus/device/function PCIe topology; it only uses it when referring to a
physical connector where a card might be installed.  What we want here
is "Device," and then we have to consider whether ARI makes any
difference here.

The spec says (referring to ASPM Control):

  For Multi-Function Devices (including ARI Devices), it is
  recommended that software program the same value for this field in
  all Functions. For non-ARI Multi-Function Devices, only capabilities
  enabled in all Functions are enabled for the component as a whole.

  For ARI Devices, ASPM Control is determined solely by the setting in
  Function 0, regardless of Function 0’s D-state. The settings in the
  other Functions always return whatever value software programmed for
  each, but otherwise are ignored by the component.

A spec reference, e.g., "PCIe r6.0, sec 7.5.3.7", would be good here.

Anyway, I think the idea of "software removing" a single function is
kind of a niche situation that we don't need to worry about
optimizing, and I think turning off ASPM completely will avoid a lot
of weird corner cases.
