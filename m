No, my position on the technical aspects of overlay support is totally
unchanged.

The only thing that has changed is that my time will not be available to
assist in future overlay related work.  The burden for this will fall
more on Rob than it has in the past.

That is avoiding my point about the current implementation being
proof of concept.
