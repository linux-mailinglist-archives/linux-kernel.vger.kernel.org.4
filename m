Thanks for confirmation and clarification.

IIUC, your saving comes from skips the intermediate state during boot, when 
APs goes through setting MTRR, which would cause SPTE zap before your this 
patch set.

MHO was, now that your ignores other vCPU's MTRR settings (unless it is 
different from BP's MTRR?), why not let each vCPU's MTRR set/update 
directly set to the per-VM MTRR states (if differs from current value). 
It's guest OS/BIOS's responsibility to keep the consistency anyway. And 
even if the malfunction caused by the inconsistency might differ from that 
of native, SDM doesn't clearly state how the malfunction should be, does it?
that's to say, anyone knows, when inconsistency happens, does it cause that 
logical processor malfunction or in fact it impacts the global MTRR 
settings? If the latter, I think leaving only the per-VM MTRR state aligns 
with native.

BTW, with regard to KVM_X86_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED, I see svm honors it while 
vmx doesn't before it clear CR0.CD/NW.

svm_set_cr0():

	if (kvm_check_has_quirk(vcpu->kvm, KVM_X86_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED))
		hcr0 &= ~(X86_CR0_CD | X86_CR0_NW);


vmx_set_cr0():

	hw_cr0 = (cr0 & ~KVM_VM_CR0_ALWAYS_OFF);

Perhaps vmx side can be fixed passingly?
