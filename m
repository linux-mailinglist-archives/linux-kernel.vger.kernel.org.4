Sure, if you're confident that it will *always* use cacheable attributes 
for any shared-memory "DMA", that makes sense.

The joke there being that memzero_explicit() on the non-cacheable alias 
means a cached copy of the key data could still be visible via the 
linear map address after the buffer is freed - especially if one can 
rely on TF-A having just pulled the whole lot into caches by reading it 
through a read-write-allocate MT_MEMORY mapping. Security is hard :)

Thanks,
Robin.
