I wrote that documentation back at the time and I fail to see what
exactly is wrong about it. Granted, it doesn't mention the Intel PCI
Configuration mechanism #1 from the PCI Local Bus Specification, but
that's just because I didn't know about it. Back when I wrote this I
was looking at the PCIe specifications (because, well, this supports
PCIe) and I noticed that it was similar to ECAM. And that's exactly
what the comment says and it points out what the differences are.

So just because the mapping is closer to PCI_CONF1_EXT_ADDRESS than
ECAM, it doesn't automatically make the comment wrong. The mapping also
isn't exactly PCI_CONF1_EXT_ADDRESS, so the new comment can be
considered equally wrong. The mapping is neither ECAM nor PCI_CONF1, so
describing it one way or the other doesn't make a difference.

Again, I don't see that this fixes anything because there was no bug.
The documentation change makes the most sense when combined with the
change that actually implements this in terms of the new macro.

The existing documentation exists to give further background information
about the mapping. If we remove the comment out of context we loose that
extra information. However, if at the same time we change the code to
use another (documented) macro, then we replace the information without
loosing anything.
