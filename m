Honestly, I don't have any idea why it is happening. The link should transition
to L1ss during suspend and we keep all resources ON.

Did ECS only observe this issue when ASPM is enabled (powersupersave)? If so,
then it is a NVMe firmware issue not Qualcomm.

Okay, thanks for the clarification. Is it possible to reproduce it on mainline?
Just to rule out the upstream vs downstream difference elsewhere.

That should also be the case to submit a patch against mainline.
