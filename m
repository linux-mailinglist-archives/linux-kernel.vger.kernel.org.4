Thanks, I actually took that code to make a generic UMD management
library, that can be used by all use cases:

I didn't think about the swapping part... thanks!

Ok to enable debugging with a config option.

Yes, that is unfortunately true, and in that case the trustworthy UMD
would not make things worse. On the other hand, on systems where that
separation is defined, the advantage would be to run more exploitable
code in user space, leaving the kernel safe.

I'm thinking about all the cases where the code had to be included in
the kernel to run at the same privilege level, but would not use any of
the kernel facilities (e.g. parsers).

If the boundary is extended to user space, some of these components
could be moved away from the kernel, and the functionality would be the
same without decreasing the security.

Or, new features that are too complex can be partially implemented in
kernel space, partially in user space, increasing their chances to be
upstreamed.
