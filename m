The problem is that this commit log doesn't explain the problem and
doesn't give us anything to connect the NVMe and WLAN assumptions with
this special driver behavior.  There needs to be some explicit
property of NVMe and WLAN that the PM core or drivers like qcom can
use to tell whether the clocks can be turned off.

This doesn't address my question.  L1.x is an ASPM feature, which
means hardware may enter or leave L1.x autonomously at any time
without software intervention.  Therefore, I don't think reading the
current state is a reliable way to decide anything.
