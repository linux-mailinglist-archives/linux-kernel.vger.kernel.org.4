FWIW, that Linux doesn't use that approach.  Linux instead only puts the cache
into no-fill mode (CR0.CD=1) when modifying MTRRs.  OVMF does both (and apparently
doesn't optimize for self-snoop?).

Probably not, but despite the SDM's assertion that software "MUST" keep things
consistent, that's not actually reality.  E.g. a careful kernel that partitions
memory doesn't need to strictly keep MTRRs consistent.  Ditto for scenarios where
CPUs are offline (for a variety of definitions of "offline"), in which case only
online CPUs need to have consistent MTRRs, e.g. before APs are brought up, MTRRs
are obviously inconsistent.

Picking a single vCPU will always be subject to edge cases.  E.g. I can see something
like kexec() "offlining" KVM's chosen vCPU and then having problems because KVM
ignores MTRR updates from other vCPUs in the new kernel.

One idea would be to let all vCPUs write the per-VM state, and zap if and only if
the MTRRs are actually different.  But as above, I'm on the fence about diverging
from what hardware actually does with respect to MTRRs.

Argh, stupid quirks.  I was going to suggest we take advantage of the guest needing
to either disable MTRRs or put the cache into no-fill mode to avoid zapping SPTEs,
i.e. skip the zap if CR0.CD=1, but KVM's implementation of the quirk is all kinds
of messed up.  KVM ignores MTRRs and guest PAT when CR0.CD=1, but then doesn't zap
when CR0.CD is cleared:

	if (((cr0 ^ old_cr0) & X86_CR0_CD) &&
	    kvm_mmu_honors_guest_mtrrs(vcpu->kvm) &&
	    !kvm_check_has_quirk(vcpu->kvm, KVM_X86_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED))
		kvm_zap_gfn_range(vcpu->kvm, 0, ~0ULL);

which means that either KVM is relying on later MTRR changes to zap the bogus
WB SPTEs, or more likely things "work" because KVM doesn't install SPTEs for the
ranges that end up being DMA'd while CR0.CD is set.

*sigh*  What an absolutely asinine quirk.  KVM should never have taken it on to
workaround OVMF's stupidity.  Good gravy, that thing was even Cc'd stable@.  Yeesh.

Aha!  Idea.  There's should be no need to ignore guest PAT when CR0.CD=1 and the
quirk is enabled.  Even OVMF must be smart enough to map its code as WB in its page
tables.  And there is no need to zap SPTEs when CR0.CD is _set_, because SPTEs
created while CR0.CD=0 would have honored MTRRs.  Lastly, DMA when CR0.CD=1 and
the quirk is enabled simply can't work since KVM historically ignores everything
from the guest and maps all memory WB.

So, if KVM zaps SPTEs when CR0.CD is cleared (even when the quirk is enabled),
then KVM can skip the MTRR zaps when CR0.CD=1 because KVM is ignoring the MTRRs
and will zap when CR0.CD is cleared.  And to avoid regressing the CR0.CD case,
if KVM honors guest PAT for the bizarro CR0.CD quirk, then KVM only needs to
zap non-WB MTRR ranges when CR0.CD is cleared.  Since WB is weak, looking for
non-WB MTRR ranges doesn't need to actually resolve the memtype, i.e. can be simple
and just
process MTRRs one by one.

Did that make sense?  Minus the code to identify non-WB MTRR ranges (and much
needed comments), the below is what I'm thinking.  If more intelligent zapping
provides the desired performance improvements, then I think/hope we avoid trying
to play games with MTRRs.
