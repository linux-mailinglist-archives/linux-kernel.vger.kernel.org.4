Here's the big picture for what I'm tryng to achieve:

 - In the common case, I'd like all programs to get a performance bump by
automatically and transparently using large anon folios - so no explicit
requirement on the process to opt-in.

 - On arm64, in the above case, I'd like the preferred folio size to be 64K;
from the (admittedly limitted) testing I've done that's about where the
performance knee is and it doesn't appear to increase the memory wastage very
much. It also has the benefits that for 4K base pages this is the contpte size
(order-4) so I can take full benefit of contpte mappings transparently to the
process. And for 16K this is the HPA size (order-2).

 - On arm64 when the process has marked the VMA for THP (or when
transparent_hugepage=always) but the VMA does not meet the requirements for a
PMD-sized mapping (or we failed to allocate, ...) then I'd like to map using
contpte. For 4K base pages this is 64K (order-4), for 16K this is 2M (order-7)
and for 64K this is 2M (order-5). The 64K base page case is very important since
the PMD size for that base page is 512MB which is almost impossible to allocate
in practice.

So one approach would be to define arch_wants_pte_order() as always returning
the contpte size (remove the vma parameter). Then max_anon_folio_order() in
memory.c could so this:


#define MAX_ANON_FOLIO_ORDER_NOTHP	ilog2(SZ_64K >> PAGE_SHIFT);

static inline int max_anon_folio_order(struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
	int order = arch_wants_pte_order();

	// Fix up default case which returns 0 because PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER
	// can't be used directly in pgtable.h
	order = order ? order : PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER;

	if (hugepage_vma_check(vma, vma->vm_flags, false, true, true))
		return order;
	else
		return min(order, MAX_ANON_FOLIO_ORDER_NOTHP);
}


This moves the SW policy into memory.c and gives you PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER (or
whatever default we decide on) as the default for arches with no override, and
also meets all my goals above.
