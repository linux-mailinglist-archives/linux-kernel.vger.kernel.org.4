I think you're saying that for (Requester ID, PASID, Untranslated
Address), the Untranslated Address is not restricted at all, and it
may look like a PCI bus address.

From a PCIe point of view, I think these cases are equivalent because
a PASID prefix doesn't affect routing (sec 2.2.10.4).  A Translation
Request includes an Untranslated Address, and if that happens to look
like a PCI bus address, I think it will be mis-routed just like a
MemRd/Wr would be.

I don't think Address Type 10b ("Translated") affects routing.  A
MemRd/Wr should be routed to a PCI peer if the Translated Address is
inside a host bridge aperture, or to the host bridge otherwise.

If PCI bus addresses are carved out of the Translated Address arena,
the MemRd/Wr TLPs should be fine, but I think the Translation Requests
that include Untranslated Addresses are still a problem.

The patch under discussion is intended to fix a v6.2-rc1 regression
added by 201007ef707a ("PCI: Enable PASID only when ACS RR & UF
enabled on upstream path").

Are we on track to fix this before v6.2?  I don't have a clear
understanding of how we know this change is safe and it only affects
AMD GPU and not other devices below the same IOMMU.
