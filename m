Yep sounds good to me, I'll fix that up.

Hmm. It's EBUSY right now. Also looks like we're missing corresponding
docs in the uapi header for this case:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9c1bec9c0b08abeac72ed6214b723adc2240=
13bf/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h#L163

I think that "this function may fail due to contention on map usage,
in which case it returns EBUSY" (or similar wording) is reasonable to
document as ABI. IMO that should go in the header linked above (which
gets turned into UAPI docs elsewhere). This particular phrasing is
going into more detail around things like the hashmap lock which
should not be described as part of the uAPI/ABI.
