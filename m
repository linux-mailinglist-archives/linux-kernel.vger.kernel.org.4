There is another peculiarity here due to which the centralized
approach turns to be less suitable. The dw_pcie_msi_host_init()
method, which currently updates the mask, isn't always executed. It's
run only if pci_msi_enabled() returns true and there is no
platform-specific dw_pci_rp.msi_host_init callback specified. Thus if
we got to implement the centralized DMA-mask setting up procedure then
it should have been done in the always executed place. That code would
have also implied the 32-bit coherent DMA-mask if the generic iMSI-RX
config is required. Thus the iMSI-RX-specific setups (data allocation
and the mask settings) would have been split up into different places
which would be less maintainable.

Moreover as you correctly noted the real DMA-mask setting up is only
needed for the eDMA-capable controllers. Meanwhile in the most of the
cases there is no eDMA embedded in the PCIe controller, but due to the
centralized approach we would need to set some mask anyway. Since I
don't know the real address bus width of all the already available DW
PCIe platforms  we'll have to fallback to using some default mask
value, which might incorrectly describe the actual device capability
(and possible cause some side-effects/regressions).

To sum up weighing up pros and cons the centralized approach seems to
me more complex, less maintainable and less flexible. In my opinion
relying on the glue-drivers to set the mask if it's needed to be set
(that is there is the embedded eDMA) is the best and the simplest
choice.

Exactly what I was going to do. I'll add a brief comment why the
coherent DMA-mask is updated in the dw_pcie_msi_host_init() method.
