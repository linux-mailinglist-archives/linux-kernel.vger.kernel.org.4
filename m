You're overselling what the change does here in a way that's getting a
bit silly.  It's just cutting down the amount of stuff the randconfig
people do, that's all.  It's not particularly bad to compile without the
DT support, I suppose you could argue that it's preserving our ability
to work with other firmware interfaces although that's a bit of a push
(but then a lot of the stuff generated by randconfig is in a similar
ballpark of course).  The whole point with COMPILE_TEST is that it's
enabling unrealistic things that probably aren't practically useful.

I'm not saying don't do the change, I'm saying don't oversell it.
