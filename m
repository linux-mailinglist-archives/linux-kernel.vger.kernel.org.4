Sorry I confused things. Keep in mind we're only talking about what 
the generated YNL code ends up looking like, not the "wire" format.
So we still "transport" things as multiple 32b chunks at netlink level.
No padding.

The question is how to render the C / C++ code on the YNL side (or 
any practical library). Are we storing all those values as bigints and
require users to coerce them to a more natural type on each access?
That'd defeat the goal of the new int type becoming the default /
"don't overthink the sizing" type.

If we have a subtype with a max size of 64b, it can be 32b or 64b on
the wire, as needed, but user space can feel assured that u64 will
always be able to store the result.

The long long is my misguided attempt to be platform dependent.
I think a better way of putting it would actually be 2 * sizeof(long).
That way we can use u128 as max, which seems to only be defined on 64b
platforms. But that's just a random thought, I'm not sure how useful 
it would be.

Perhaps we need two types, one "basic" which tops out at 64b and one
"really bigint" which can be used as bitmaps as well?
