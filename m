After sleeping on this, I'm even more in disagreement with renaming
value to state.

AIUI, the confusion here is distinguishing between the physical and
logical cases.  libgpiod doesn't have this problem, as it only deals
with logical.

By convention, gpiolib uses _raw in the function name when referring to
physical, and otherwise deals with logical. e.g. gpiod_set_value() and
gpiod_set_raw_value().  Changing "value" to "state" is orthogonal to the
actual problem.

Further, "state" is a more broad term than "value", i.e. state may
include a number of attributes, whereas value indicates an individial
attribute.

For lines, state and value are typically synonymous, as the line level
(just to throw in another term for it) is what usually springs to
mind when considering a line.  But a line's state could also be
interpreted to include direction, bias, drive,...
You may argue that those form the configuration state, and I would agree
with you - the "configuration" indicating a subset of the overall line
state. i.e. "state" is a broad term.

If you are trying to reduce confusion, switching from a more specific
to a more broad term is going in the wrong direction.

OTOH, I totally agree with the addition of GPIOD_ACTIVE/INACTIVE to be
used for the logical cases, and even a script to apply it globally.
Ideally that script would change both the calls to the logical functions
to use ACTIVE/INACTIVE, and the physical to HIGH/LOW.

Introducing enums for those, and changing the function signatures to
use those rather than int makes sense to me too.  Though I'm not sure
why that has to wait until after all users are changed to the new macros.
Would that generate lint warnings?

Cheers,
Kent.
