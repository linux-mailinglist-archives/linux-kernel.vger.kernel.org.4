not quite get what you meant here.

no, I didn't wrap RPMB packet in query-request/response, it is inupiu_req and upiu_rsp, it is upiu command. Based on Bart's suggestion,
we shouldn't change the current ufs_bsg structure. I think his concern
is that if we change ufs_bsg structure, the user space tool also
needs to change as well.

Yes, agree with you on this point. But we still need to use reserved
slots for RPMB or command UPIU, we don't want to affect IO requests on
the normal path.

One problem is that we didn't split the dev_manage command and the RPMB
command in their completion handlers. I would like to change dev_man to
passthrough or something else, and then split dev_man and RPMB,
otherwise, they would be mixed in one dev_man completion handler. No
technical issues here, just want to make it more readable and
maintainable.



Kind regards,
Bean
