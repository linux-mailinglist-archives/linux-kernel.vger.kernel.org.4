Thank you for reviewing the patch. The return value of -ETIMEDOUT from the
function cdns_pcie_host_training_complete() added by this patch will be handled
similar to the -ETIMEDOUT from the cdns_pcie_host_wait_for_link() function that
is already present.

If cdns_pcie_host_training_complete() returns -ETIMEDOUT, it is returned to
cdns_pcie_host_start_link() function which is called within
cdns_pcie_host_setup() function. In the cdns_pcie_host_setup() function, there
is already a dev_dbg() print for handling the case where
cdns_pcie_host_wait_for_link() times out. For this reason, I felt that for both
cases, the dev_dbg() print can be used to debug without the need for an extra
log message. Please let me know if that's fine.

Regards,
Siddharth.
