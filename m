Yes, you're right. Then I think the only place that
bfq_weights_tree_remove() can free bfqq is from bfq_del_bfqq_busy().
I'll move the following comment with a little adjustment here, which is
from bfq_weights_tree_remove() before this patchset:

         /*
         ┊* Next function is invoked last, because it causes bfqq to be
         ┊* freed. DO NOT use bfqq after the next function invocation.
         ┊*/
