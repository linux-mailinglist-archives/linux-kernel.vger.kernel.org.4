Sure, it'd work if we could select the filter mechanism based on the
event type.  One thing to note is BPF filter requires root permission
even if the event itself does not.  Users might be surprised if it
suddenly requires root for their userspace profiling.

I think the tracepoint filters are different as they work on the event-
specific data field.  From the sample data's perspective, it's just
RAW data and current BPF filters do nothing with it.

So I'd rather simply delegate it to the tracepoint.

Making the parser accept those syntax would not be that difficult.
But I'm afraid of the BPF program doing the job and how we can
build the map to achieve that.
