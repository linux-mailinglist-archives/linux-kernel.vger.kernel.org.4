DearMike

I am very glad that you noticed my patch version 2.
I'm sure your experience will help.

Thank you so much for your help with the function blk_mq_submit_bio().
This fix helped the veeamsnap module to continue working on RHEL 8
with a minimal set of crutches. But besides RHEL 8, there are other
distributions that required support.

The catalyst was the optimization of Christoph and the removal of
the make_request_fn() callback function in v5.9. See:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.18/source/include/linux/blkdev.h#L406
Overriding this function allowed handling I/O units.

And yes, Iâ€™ve spent several months trying to refine the DM in order to
implement the feature of attaching DM devices on the fly, that you said you
would like to have in DM. Alas, I have not achieved success. I figured that
it would take a lot of changes in the DM code before its non-persistent
snapshots can be used for backup, and some architectural changes will be
required. Although you have been very helpful for a while, at some point
you stopped providing any feedback and thus I started to explore other
possibilities to solve the problem.

Seeing your annoyance now, I wonder what would be the better way to continue
my work in the given circumstances? What kind of action would you expect from
me in such situation? Being left without any feedback and guidance on DM,
I decided to work directly with the community to find better solution.

That is, I took another route (blksnap) not because I thought the initial 
DM-based approach proposed by you was inferior or bad, but because only this
direction remained available to me.

As for the article on LWN:

I am very grateful to Jonathan for his article. It attract some attention
to my work. However, itâ€™s wasnâ€™t a deliberate PR company from Veeam.
In fact, Veeam has nothing to do with the article.

Yes, I work for the company, but the company has neither requested the
article, nor has started any other PR regarding the matter.

If I were organizing a PR campaign, the article would be similar to this:
https://github.com/veeam/blksnap/blob/master/doc/Something-wrong-with-snapshots-for-Linux.md
But be careful! In the article I try to change the reader's opinion about
snapshots. Feedback, as usual, is welcome.

Mike, I assure you, I have one goal. Snapshots of block devices in the
Linux kernel for backup.

I think we got off to a good start initially, but then something went wrong 
(miscommunications, misunderstanding, and a lack of time) so here we are.
If you could clarify what could have been the proper way of dealing with
that situation from my side, I would really appreciate that.

I am sure that this is quite achievable. If the dm-dev team has special
needs when attaching DM devices via blkfilter, we will be able to upgrade it.
At the moment I don't see any problems with this.
I can promise you to add you to Ð¡Ð¡ when sending next patches.

Sounds good?

Yes, that's right. There are quite a few changes in block-core.
From the blksnap, it is enough to view tracker.c. I/O handling is
implemented there.
But it's probably better to wait for the next version of patch that takes
into account Christoph's comments. There are a lot of changes, and first
of all in the interface.

Itâ€™s not about Veeam at all. I am sure that my work will help many backup 
vendors and average users to build more robust and efficient backup tools.
So, the argument that I do it just because Veeam needs it does not hold
any water â€“ I know that many people need the feature, not just Veeam.
