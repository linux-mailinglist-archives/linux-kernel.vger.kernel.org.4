Yes, if Will and Peter has no objection. I think it is less risky and 
handle the partition case better.

With v1, Will's patch should get similar result as the existing 
guarantee_online_cpus() function since we can infer offline cpus from 
cpus_allowed. With v2, it does include offline cpus correctly, I 
believe, as long as no partition is enabled. However, the hotplug code 
is able to update the cpumasks when a CPU is onlined. So the presence of 
offline CPUs is nice to have, but not essential.

Yes, that is correct.

Right. Let hear if Will and Peter agree with this plan. I have tested 
this patch and it passed Peter's reproducer test correctly. During 
testing, I uncovered another bug in the cpu affinity code which results 
in a separate scheduler patch to fix it.
