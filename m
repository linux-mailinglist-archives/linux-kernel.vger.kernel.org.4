Thank you for your review!

I'm sorry I didn't make myself clear here.

Yes, we can't get i_rwsem after holding mmap_sem at any time, otherwise
ABBA deadlock may occur. The "add inode_lock directly" in my patch
description actually looks like this:
```

Originally, ext4_page_mkwrite could be freely concurrent with write,
but after adding inode_lock as in the above scenario, the two would
compete for inode_lock, thus having a performance impact on the
scenario where ext4_page_mkwrite and write are called at the same
time. The ext4_file_map will definitely be called before calling
ext4_page_mkwrite, and ext4_file_map will be called much less often,
so the logic for locking and performing convert is moved here to
reduce the performance impact.

I'm very sorry I didn't take this situation into account.

Thank you for pointing out the problem!

Indeed!

I will send a patch V2 with the changes suggested by you.

Thanks again!
