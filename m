For those who didn't receive the patch set I just sent, I worked around
the first problem of supporting PGP for verifying the authenticity of
RPM headers and use them with IMA Appraisal.

I introduced in the kernel a new key format, TLV-based, and plan to let
Linux distribution vendors convert PGP keys to this new format in their
building infrastructure (trusted). The converted keys are embedded in
the kernel image.

Signatures can be converted in user space at run-time, since altering
them would make signature verification fail.

You can find the patch set here:
