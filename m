For some part yes, but at least those copy-pasted gpu setup codes did some 
other things too.

In any case, it would go against some earlier policy decision:

/**
 * pci_disable_link_state - Disable device's link state, so the link will
 * never enter specific states.  Note that if the BIOS didn't grant ASPM
 * control to the OS, this does nothing because we can't touch the LNKCTL
 * register. Returns 0 or a negative errno.

Is it fine to make core capable of violating that policy?

One question before I trying to come up something is when PCIEASPM is =n, 
should I provide some simple function that just does the LNKCTL write to 
disable it? And another thing is the existing quirks, should they be 
kept depending on the existing behavior or not?
