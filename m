That document, right where you linked, says:

	The list-table formats can be useful for tables that are not
	easily laid out in the usual Sphinx ASCII-art formats. These
	formats are nearly impossible for readers of the plain-text
	documents to understand, though, and should be avoided in the
	absence of a strong justification for their use.

The list-table formats exist for a reason, and sometimes they can't
really be avoided, but they do impose a heavy readability cost on the
plain-text files.

I don't quite understand this comment; I don't think anybody is asking
you to take information out?  Just to use one of the other table formats
if you can.

That sentence is fine, I wouldn't mess with it.

Thanks,
