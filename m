This is really an important "detail" changelog should mention. While I
am not really against that change I would much rather see that as a
result of a real world fix rather than a theoretical concern. Mostly
because a real life scenario would allow us to test the
__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL effectivness. As that request might fail as well we
just end up with a theoretical fix for a theoretical problem. Something
that is easy to introduce but much harder to get rid of should we ever
need to change __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL implementation for example.

Yes, this really bothered me when the concept was introduced initially.
I am always concerned when you need to allocate in order to free memory.
Practically speaking we haven't heard about bug reports so maybe this is
not such a big deal as I thought.
