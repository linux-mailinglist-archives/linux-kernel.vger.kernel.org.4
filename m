When looking at the wire to MSI abomination and also PASID there is no
real per domain struct. It's plain integer information and I hate to
store it in a pointer. Especially as the pointer width on 32bit is not
necessarily sufficient.

Allocating 8 bytes and tracking them to be freed would be an horrible
idea.

At least from the two examples I have (IDXD and wire2MSI) the per
instance union works perfectly fine and I can't see a reason why
e.g. for your usecase

     cookie = { .ptr = myqueue };

would not work. The meaning of the cookie is domain implementation
defined and only the actual MSI domain and the related users know
whether its a value or a pointer and what to do with this information. I
named it cookie because from the core MSI code's view it's completely
opaque and aside of the fact that the allocation function copies the
cookie into msi_desc, the core does not care at all about it. Same for
the domain one which is solely handled by the domain setup code and is
e.g. used to enable the irq chip callbacks to do what they need to do.

Thanks,
