I think this has a lot of potential.  I haven't tried it, but I wonder
if splitting out the Root Port-specific parts to a separate function
would be helpful, if only to make it more obvious that there may be
two different devices involved.

If there are two devices ("dev" is a bridge below a Root Port), I
guess support in the Root Port is not necessarily required?  E.g.,
could "dev" assert a wakeup GPE that's not routed through the Root
Port?  If Root Port support *is* required, maybe it would read more
clearly to test that first, before looking at the downstream device.
