BGRT is a ACPI table not a EFI configuration table, so I'd assume it
is treated the same way as other ACPI tables

MOKvar is a fallback for systems where it doesn't fit into a volatile
variable IIRC but I am not sure if it is actually implemented
anywhere, and what type of memory region it is expected to use.

However, I'm not sure if it even matters, given that Xen loads the
dom0 kernel not the firmware, right?
