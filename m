I have seen this too, the controller advertises the capability. However, the TRM
(section 17.5.9) says that MSI-X is not supported (MSI / INTx only as you said).
So the solution should be to modify the probe function of the endpoint
controller
so that the MSI-X capability would not be advertised, this should fix
your problem.

I wonder if one could still implement MSI-X because from the endpoint we would
just need to implement it as a message (TLP) over PCIe (because the space for
the vectors is allocated and written, so that part should be ok). I am
not an expert
on MSI-X, but the reason the endpoint cannot send them could be because MSI-X
requires some fields in the PCIe header descriptor to be filled with values that
cannot be set through the "desc0-3" registers of the RK3399 PCIe endpoint core.

Anyways, the endpoint should not advertise the MSI-X capabilities when it cannot
send such interrupts. Once this is fixed you should be able to have your NVMe
function running.

Regards.
