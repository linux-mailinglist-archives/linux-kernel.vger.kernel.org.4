I know the A/D status of the refcounted, VM_PFNMAP|VM_IO backed pages
will be recorded. And I have no idea if this is a necessary requirement
either.

But it feels awkward to see the head and the tail ones of non-compound
pages be treated inconsistently. After all, the head page just happens
to have its refcount being 1, it is not a real refcounted page.

So I would suggest to mention such different behehavior in the commit
message at least. :)

Sorry, my brain just got baked... Pls just ignore this question :)
