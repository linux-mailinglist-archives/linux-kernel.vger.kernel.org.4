As this thread kind of went silent and as the 'big merge' for this 
feature is getting closer, here a final plee, inspired by this slashdot 
post [0].

The post in itself speaks of a new team forming on working on the Rust 
styleguide, which in itself is still evolving. This makes sense, rust is 
new, it's not very commonly in use and as with all good things, they evolve.

One comment in that slashdot post [1] I want to bring forward and quote 
a piece of:
"i created a new repository, and thought i was being hip and modern, so
i started to evangelize spaces for the 'consistency across environments'

i get approached by not one, but TWO coworkers who unfortunately are 
highly visually impaired and each has a different visual impairment

at that moment, i instantaneously conceded â€” there's just no 
counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility 
needs of valued coworkers"

Visual impairness is a thing, it does not make someone smarter or 
dumber. Helping those with visual impairments should be concidered, and 
not shunted off by saying 'but the rust guys came up with the perfect 
style, so we should use it'.

Find attached, a diff to the .rustfmt.toml, that should keep things more 
consistent with the current kernel style.

I'll leave it now to Linus and Greg to concsider this, and will keep my 
peace (though I hope they actually read it :p).
