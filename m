FWIW, I proposed a rewritten section of
Documentation/process/handling-regressions.rst that is closely related
to this. The new text says:

```
+ * Do not consider regressions from the current cycle as something that
can wait
+   till the end of the cycle, as the issue might discourage or prevent
users and
+   CI systems from testing mainline now or generally.
[...]
+ * Aim to mainline a fix within two or three days, if the issue is
severe or
+   bothering many users -- either in general or in prevalent conditions
like a
+   particular hardware environment, distribution, or stable/longterm
series.```

For details and context see
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/6971680941a5b7b9cb0c2839c75b5cc4ddb2d162.1684139586.git.linux@leemhuis.info/

Let me known if you think I should be more explicit; I could simply add
a "this includes, but is not limited to fixes for build errors" to the
second segment mentioned above. But well, that yet again would make the
text longer. :-(

Ciao, Thorsten
