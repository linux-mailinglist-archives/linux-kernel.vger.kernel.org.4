Right, that path is called in process context and can sleep, there is no
need in irq disabled variant there.

Exactly, we already called to spin_lock_irqsave(), there is no value in
doing it twice.
void f() {
	spin_lock_irqsave(...)
	spin_lock_irqsave(...)
	....
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(...)
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(...)
}

is exactly the same as
void f() {
	spin_lock_irqsave(...)
	spin_lock(...)
	....
	spin_unlock(...)
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(...)
}

Thanks
