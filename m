I'd hoped to write that up today, but I haven't had enough time yet, so I'll
try to write up that proposal next week.

The rough idea was to *somehow* rejig the per-callsite ftrace_ops code I've
been working on to permit (but not require) the use of custom trampolines. As
mentioned during the call I want to ensure that this doesn't adversely affect
regular ftrace usage, and I'd also like to ensure that the regular ftrace code
is able to gain form those changes (without the need for trampolines). AFAICT,
that's likely to require some rework to the way direct functions are managed.

The WIP code for per-callsite ftrace_ops is at:

 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/linux.git/log/?h=arm64/ftrace/per-callsite-ops

To be clear, my comments were purely about the *mechanism* we end up
implementing. I do have concerns w.r.t. overriding arbitrary parts of the
kernel.

Thanks,
Mark.
