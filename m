Well, right now module_alloc() uses arch-exported constants, we could
keep doing that if it makes sense.

Or the structs could go in a separate header file that better indicates
what they're for. The main point is just that - when we're writing new
code and creating a new interface, it's very helpful if we can have the
header file basically be the documentation for what the external
interface is. Put your big kernel doc "what is this thing about" comment
in that file, too :)

I don't think anyone's working on this yet, so if you're interested I
think it might be helpful.

Yeah, I think the "enumerate types of allocations that want similar page
permission handling" is a good thing to focus on.
