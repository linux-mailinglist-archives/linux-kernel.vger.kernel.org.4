Documenting would at least be an improvement over what we have today
since it would eliminate the need to re-explain the preferred rules
every time. We can just point to the documentation when reviewing
patches.

`git log --pretty=oneline` is not a great way to document shortlog
scopes because it does not explain the rules (e.g. when to use "KVM:
x86: " vs "KVM: x86/mmu: "), does not explain why things the way they
are, and is inconsistent since we don't always catch every patch that
goes by with a non-preferred shortlog scope.
