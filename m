Which we just discussed completely away. :)

So there is a theoretical problem here that device interrupts could
starve system vectors due to the priority scheme. Needs some thought.

That whole APIC priority muck is pretty useless as long as CR8 writes
are slower than sti/cli. When I tested that last (Broadwell) they were
significantly slower.

Also it's unclear how that expansion vector space is handled
vs. priorities.

Ideally event delivery would be FIFO because that's the only guarantee
for preventing starvation without having to configure priorities (which
is mostly a wrong guess anyway).
