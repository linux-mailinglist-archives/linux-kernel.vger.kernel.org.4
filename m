And due to the fact that SEV and TDX really do not work, how is anyone
expecting any of this to work?  As one heckler on IRC recently put it,
if you squint hard enough, you can kind of ignore the real-world issues
here, so perhaps this should all be called "squint-puting" in order to
feel like you have a "confidential" system?  :)

Great, so why not have hardware attestation also for your devices you
wish to talk to?  Why not use that as well?  Then you don't have to
worry about anything in the guest.

And again, do the same thing for the other hardware devices and all is
good.  To not do that is to just guess and wave hands.  You know this :)

So the guest can stop itself?

How do you trust you got real data on the disk?  On the network?  Those
are coming from the host, how is any of that data to be trusted?  Where
does the trust stop and why?

I know that all PCI drivers can NOT do that today as that was never
anything that Linux was designed for.

I agree with you there, USB drivers are only starting to be fuzzed at
the descriptor level, that's all.  Which is why they too can be put into
the "untrusted" area until you trust them.

Why not just create a whole new bus path for these "trusted" devices to
attach to and do that instead of tyring to emulate a protocol that was
explicitly designed NOT to this model at all?  Why are you trying to
shoehorn something here and not just designing it properly from the
beginning?

We have protection for that, and have had it for many years.  Same for
USB devices.  This isn't new, perhaps you all have not noticed those
features be added and taken advantage of already by many Linux distros
and system images (i.e. ChromeOS and embedded systems?)

> We're now in the position we were with random USB devices years ago.

Nope, we are not, again, we already handle random PCI devices being
plugged in.  It's up to userspace to make the policy decision if it
should be trusted or not before the kernel has access to it.

So a meta-comment, why not just use that today?  If your guest OS can
not authenticate the PCI device passed to it, don't allow the kernel to
bind to it.  If it can be authenticated, wonderful, bind away!  You can
do this today with no kernel changes needed.

Define "validated" please.

The "CoCo" world seems distant and separate from the real-world of Linux
kernel development if you all do not even know about the authentication
methods that we have for years for enabling access to PCI and USB
devices as described above.  If the impementations that we currently
have are lacking in some way, wonderful, please submit changes for them
and we will be glad to review them as needed.

Remember, it's up to you all to convince us that your changes make
actual sense and are backed up with working implementations.  Not us :)

good luck!
