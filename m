It's not that I don't like the approach. Now after the @William's
patch is merged in I don't really see a well suitable place for
setting the real DMA-mask of the DW PCIe controller for the eDMA
operations. I didn't want to set the mask in the DW eDMA probe
function since it was common for both eDMA embedded into a remote PCIe
function and installed into the local Root Port/End-point device. In
the first case the DMA-mask is already set in the dw-edma-pcie.c
driver. In order to cover the later case I was going to use the
low-level platform drivers. But after not being able to get rid from
the DMA-mask override performed in the MSI-setup procedure I will have
no choice to hack the eDMA driver somehow (see the last comment for
details).

Actually it does. Based on the MSI 64-bit MSI flags state we would need
to chose either the pure 32-bit or 64/32-bit mask. Of course hotplug
would be a problem. But it's not the point in this case.

Right, that would have solved the problem with setting the DMA-mask to
a correct device. But the PCIe-space-related "dma-ranges" would be
still left applied to the DW PCIe platform device. Moreover in general
the PCIe host interface can have its own "dma-ranges". So we'll need
to have two types of the "dma-ranges": for the PCIe-bus to initialize
the inbound iATU and for the DW PCIe-controller itself. Furthermore
the later translations are applicable for the former addresses too...

There is no way at the current pci_host_probe() method implementation
because it performs the host bridge device registration and the
PCIe-bus scanning. There either have to be a hook to be called after
the bridge is registered or the pci_host_probe() would have to be
split up into two sub-methods: bridge-registration and scan child
buses. I have doubts that either case would be happily welcomed by
@Bjorn.

I meant the same. It's unchanged, but if before the @William' patch we
could have drop the DMA-mask change at the assumption that the CPU and
PCIe spaces are identical and relying on the DMA32 zone availability,
now we can't because of the dma_alloc_coherent() method utilization.

Right. It is. That's why I was trying to come up with an approach for
@William to drop the DMA-mask override at all, i.e. either rely on the
default DMA-mask state or just move the mask setting to the low-level
DW PCIe platform drivers.

That's why I noted "if we don't take the dma-ranges settings into
account". Taking out a wrong device utilization and if the CPU and PCIe
spaces are identical then passing the *platform device* to the DMA API
will do what is expected by the current code.

Ok. It is indeed not pointless taking the fact that the __GFP_DMA32 can
do nothing. (I would have renamed the __GFP_DMA32 flag to something like
__GFP_DMA32_NOT_GUARANTEED then)

I am starting to get confused because the problem has turned to be
multi-dimensional. We started discussing the DMA-mask override, while
now we are talking about a wrong device usage and the dma-ranges bug.
Let me sum up so we could come to some conclusions on each problem. 

1. This patch is already merged in by @Lorenzo.
The streaming and coherent DMA-masks are still forced to be of 32-bits
in the DW PCIe platform device. The low-level DW PCIe platform drivers
can't be used to set a correct mask now since it will be overwritten
by the MSI-setup procedure.

* Temporary solution: I'll override the DMA-mask in the eDMA driver:
try 64-bit mask, if failed - fallback to 32-bit mask. In fact I'll set
the DMA-mask to the DMAengine backing device since it will be used for
the correct DMA-mappings anyway (see problem 3.)

2. The DMA-mask is set to a wrong device in the framework of the
MSI-setup procedure.
Indeed it is supposed to be set to the PCI bridge device. But we can't
do that due to the pci_host_probe() method implementation. The device
is not ready for the DMA-mask update and the memory allocation/mapping
at the stage of the MSI-setup procedure execution. Isn't it? (Note the
empty instance is available at that stage.)

3. PCIe-bus-related DMA-ranges are applied to the PCIe host interface.
This is a bug. It can't be easily fixed due to the PCIe-specific
semantic of the "dma-ranges" OF-property. @Robin promised to think of
a proper solution for this.

* Temporary solution: I'll set the dma_chan.dev->chan_dma_dev flag to
true, just initialize the DMA-parameters of the DMA-channel backing
device instance by using the {of,acpi}_dma_configure() methods and drop the
dma_range_map assigned to it. In addition I'll set the DMA-mask of the
DMA-channel backing device too to solve the problem 1 (see above).

Sounds like a doable plan. What do you think?
