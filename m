I think they're just different enough that trying too hard to converge
them might obfuscate things. If the determination didn't come from 2
completely different fields (gpa vs. fault flags) maybe it could be
simplified a bit more, but have well-defined open-coded handler that
gets called once to set fault->is_private during initial fault time so
that that ugliness never needs to be looked at again by KVM MMU seems
like a good way to keep things simple through the rest of the handling.

struct kvm_page_fault seems to be the preferred way to pass additional
params/metadata around, and .is_private field was introduced to track
this private/shared state as part of UPM base series:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20221202061347.1070246-9-chao.p.peng@linux.intel.com/

So it seems like unecessary complexity to track/encode that state into
other additional places rather than just encapsulating it all in
fault->is_private (or some similar field), and synthesizing all this
platform-specific handling into a well-defined value that's conveyed
by something like fault->is_private in a way where KVM MMU doesn't need
to worry as much about platform-specific stuff seems like a good thing,
and in line with what the UPM base series was trying to do by adding the
fault->is_private field.

So all I'm really proposing is that whatever SNP and TDX end up doing
should center around setting that fault->is_private field and keeping
everything contained there. If there are better ways to handle *how*
that's done I don't have any complaints there, but moving/adding bits
to GPA/error_flags after fault time just seems unecessary to me when
fault->is_private field can serve that purpose just as well.

That's correct, but the C-bit doesn't show in the GPA that gets passed
up to KVM during an #NPF, and instead gets encoded into the fault's
error_flags.

We actually had exactly this in v7 of SNP hypervisor patches:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-coco/20221214194056.161492-7-michael.roth@amd.com/T/#m17841f5bfdfb8350d69d78c6831dd8f3a4748638

but Sean was hoping to avoid a callback, which is why we ended up using
a bitmask in this version since it basically all that callback would
need to do. It's unfortunately that we don't have a common scheme
between SNP/TDX, but maybe that's still possible, I just think that
whatever that ends up being, it should live and be contained inside
whatever helper ends up setting fault->is_private.

There's some other awkwardness with a callback approach. It sort of ties
into your question about selftests so I'll address it below...

The self-tests I'm referring to here are the ones from Vishal that shipped with
v10 of Chao's UPM/fd-based private memory series, and also as part of Sean's
gmem tree:

  https://github.com/sean-jc/linux/commit/a0f5f8c911804f55935094ad3a277301704330a6

These exercise gmem/UPM handling without the need for any SNP/TDX
hardware support. They do so by "trusting" the shared/private state
that the VMM sets via KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES. So if VMM says it
should be private, KVM MMU will treat it as private, so we'd never
get a mismatch, so KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT will never be generated.

In above self-test use-case, there is no reliance on hardware support,
and fault->is_private should always be treated as being whatever was
set by the VMM via KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES, so that's why I proposed
the KVM_FAULT_VMM_DEFINED value to encode that case into
fault->is_private so KVM MMU and handle protected self-test VMs of this
sort.

In the future, this protected self-test VMs might become the basis of
a new protected VM type where some sort of guest-issued hypercall can
be used to set whether a fault should be treated as shared/private,
rather than relying on VMM-defined value. There's some current discussion
about that here:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230620190443.GU2244082@ls.amr.corp.intel.com/T/#me627bed3d9acf73ea882e8baa76dfcb27759c440

Going back to your callback question above, that makes things a little
awkward, since kvm_x86_ops is statically defined for both
kvm_amd/kvm_intel modules, and either can run these self-tests guests as
well as these proposed "non-CC VMs" which rely on enlightened guest
kernels instead of TDX/SNPhardware support for managing private/shared
access.

So you either need to duplicate the handling for how to determine
private/shared for these other types into the kvm_intel/kvm_amd callbacks,
or have some way for the callback to say to "fall back to the common
handling for self-tests and non-CC VMs". The latter is what we implemented
in v8 of this series, but Isaku suggested it was a bit too heavyweight
and proposed dropping the fall-back logic in favor of updating the
kvm_x86_ops at run-time once we know whether or not it's a TDX/SNP guest:

  https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2303.2/03009.html

which could work, but it still doesn't address Sean's desire to avoid
callbacks completely, and still amounts to a somewhat convulated way
to hide away TDX/SNP-specific bit checks for shared/private. Rather
than hide them away in callbacks that are already frowned upon by
maintainer, I think it makes sense to "open-code" all these checks in a
common handler like kvm_fault_is_private() to we can make some progress
toward a consensus, and then iterate on it from there rather than
refining what may already be a dead-end path.
