I thought the DT was supposed to describe properties of the
*hardware*, but this seems more like "use this untested clkreq
configuration," which maybe could be done via a module parameter?

Whatever the mechanism, it looks like patch 2/5 makes brcmstb
advertise the appropriate ASPM and L1SS stuff in the PCIe and L1SS
Capabilities so the OS will do the right thing without any core
changes.

Right.  Of course, if ASPM and L1SS support are advertised, the OS can
still choose whether to enable them, and that choice can change at
run-time.

BTW, the DT comment in the patch refers to PCIe Mini CEM .0 sec
3.2.5.2.5.  I think the correct section is 3.2.5.2.2 (at least in the
r2.1 spec).

There's also a footnote to the effect that T_CRLon is allowed to
exceed 400ns when LTR is supported and enabled.  L1.2 requires LTR, so
if L1.2 is the case where brcmstb exceeds 400ns, that might not be a
problem.
