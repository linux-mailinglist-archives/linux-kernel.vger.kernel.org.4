Thanks Sean. Let me try to rephrase my understandings of your statement(
and pls feel free to correct me):

1> For now, what vmx_adjust_secondary_exec_control() does, is to enable/
disable a feature in VMX MSR(and nVMX MSR) based on cpuid changes.
2> What makes sense is, if a feature is 
	a. disabled by guest CPUID, it shall not be exposed in guest VMX MSR;
	b. enabled by guest CPUID, it could be either exposed or hidden in
	guest VMX MSR.
3> So your previous change is to guarantee 2.a, and userspace VMM can choose
to follow follow either choices in 2.b(depending on whether it believes this
feature is correctly supported by KVM in nested). 

Is above understanding correct? 

But what if userspace VMM sets guest CPUID first, disabling a feature, and
then sets the guest VMX MSR bit with this feature enabled? Does KVM need to
check guest CPUID again, in vmx_restore_control_msr()? 

I do not think above scenario is what QEMU does - QEMU checks guest CPUID
first with kvm_arch_get_supported_cpuid() before trying to set guest VMX MSR.
But I am not sure if this is mandatory step for all userspace VMM.

Got it. I'll check that. Thanks!
