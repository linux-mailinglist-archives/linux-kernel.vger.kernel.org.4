Agreed, this is the way we're using the tool internally. It's great as a 
quick spot-check on a change.

Right, there are several classes of false positives that we've 
documented and when examining thousands of commits at time, it'll flag 
many things.

For some comparison, if you run checkpatch on the same changeset 
(v6.2..v6.3-rc1), you get 995 errors and 7,313 warnings. Still, 
checkpatch is helpful for spot-checks.

"./scripts/check-uapi.sh -b v6.3-rc1 -p v6.2" flags 36 out of the 911 
files checked. Of those 36, 19 fell into the currently documented false 
positive categories:

Enum expansion: 17
Expanding into padded/reserved fields: 2

Beyond those, the tool appears to be flagging legitimate breakages.

Some fit into the definition of "intentional breakages" where support is 
being dropped or something is being refactored:

  File removals:
    - include/uapi/drm/i810_drm.h
    - include/uapi/drm/mga_drm.h
    - include/uapi/drm/r128_drm.h
    - include/uapi/drm/savage_drm.h
    - include/uapi/drm/sis_drm.h
    - include/uapi/drm/via_drm.h
    - include/uapi/linux/meye.h

  File moves:
    - include/uapi/misc/habanalabs.h

  Removal of struct:
    - include/uapi/linux/uuid.h (5e6a51787fef)
      - include/uapi/linux/mei.h (failed due to uuid.h)
      - include/uapi/linux/ublk_cmd.h (failed due to uuid.h)

Others do not seem to be intentional:

  Addition/use of flex arrays:
    - include/uapi/linux/rseq.h (f7b01bb0b57f)
    - include/uapi/scsi/scsi_bsg_mpi3mr.h (c6f2e6b6eaaf)

  Type change:
    - include/uapi/scsi/scsi_bsg_ufs.h (3f5145a615238)

  Additions into existing struct:
    - include/uapi/drm/amdgpu_drm.h (b299221faf9b)
    - include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h (09519ec3b19e)
    - include/uapi/linux/virtio_blk.h (95bfec41bd3d)

Is there something I'm missing that makes these changes false positives? 
If so, I'd be happy to add on to the documentation and work towards a 
way to filter them out.

In the mean time, we will start a thread on the libabigail mailing list 
to see if there's a way to add flags such as --ignore-enum-expansion, 
--ignore-expansion-into-reserved-fields, etc. Enum expansion seems to be 
making up the largest portion of false positives, so would be the best 
thing to filter out.

Yes, this can be taken care of.
