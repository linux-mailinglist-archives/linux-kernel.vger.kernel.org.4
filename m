It would just use the pre-allocated snp_dev->certs_data buffer with npages 
set to the full size of that buffer.

We need to be able to return the attestation bits that came back with the 
extra certs. So just error out of the ioctl with the length error and let 
user-space retry with the recommended number of pages.
