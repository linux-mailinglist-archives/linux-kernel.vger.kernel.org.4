Removing and deprecating are different.  We can deprecate stuff.

We talked a bit in the patchwork meeting with Drew about ACPI.  Any 
actual spec/encoding would need to be different, of course, but 
conceptually it seems to fit fine.  It's also broadly similar to what 
we've done with riscv_hwprobe() for userspace, which is nice.

I'm not sure how sensitive people are to DT size (presumably it'd be DTB 
size)?

It's also not clear what we can do about it: RISC-V has lots of 
extensions, that's going to take encoding space.  Sticking with an 
ambiguous encoding because it's smaller seems like a way to get 
burned in the long run.
