Not really.  Jim is asserting that the READ_ONCE() is pointless, and I completely
agree.  I am also saying that I think there is a real memory ordering issue here,
and that it was being papered over by the READ_ONCE() in kvm_mmu_pte_write().

No, the smp_*b() variants are just compiler barriers on x86.

The reexecute_instruction() case should be fine without any fanciness, it's
nothing more than a heuristic, i.e. neither a false positive nor a false negative
will impact functional correctness, and nothing changes regardless of how many
times the compiler reads the variable outside of mmu_lock.

I was thinking that it would be better to have a single helper to locklessly
access indirect_shadow_pages, but I agree that applying the barriers to
reexecute_instruction() introduces a different kind of confusion.

Want to post a v2 of yours without a READ_ONCE(), and I'll post a separate fix
for the theoretical kvm_mmu_pte_write() race?  And then Paolo can tell me that
there's no race and school me on lockless programming once more ;-)
