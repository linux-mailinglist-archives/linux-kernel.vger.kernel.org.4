Summary from https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/68
 - Numerous uncore event additions and changes.
 - Description updates for core events XQ.FULL_CYCLES and MISC2_RETIRED.LFE=
NCE.
 - Update ARITH.IDIV_ACTIVE counter mask.

This change also gets rid of uncore-other as a topic, derived from the
file name, breaking it apart in to more specific topics.
