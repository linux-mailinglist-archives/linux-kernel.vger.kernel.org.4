Xen could provide PSCI to EL1 guests using the HVC conduit. However if 
EL2 is the highest implemented EL, then Xen is the most privileged 
software in the system - it would have to own the EL2 exception vectors, 
and it would have to own the low-level CPU bringup code. At that point 
it just wouldn't make much sense to HVC *itself* via the PSCI protocol 
when it could simply call the function directly.
