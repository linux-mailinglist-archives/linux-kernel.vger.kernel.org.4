Your understanding is correct that the parameter block is a set of items 
(or properties) of variouse lengths in HW. The parameter blocks are 
comparable to PCI capabilities in PCI config space. Each capability has its own 
defined stucture.

Yes, from the DFL core's perspective, the parameter blocks are opaque 
chunks of data. This would affirm your preference of using (void *) and 
byte size in the API for the function, dfh_find_param.
