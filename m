The only reason rebuild_root_domains() is called is because the the 
scheduling domains were changed. The cpuset.sched_load_balance control 
file is 1 by default. If no one touch it, there is just one global 
scheduling domain that covers all the active CPUs. However, by setting 
cpuset.sched_load_balance to 0 in the right cpusets, you can create 
multiple scheduling domains or disabling load balancing on some CPUs. 
With that setup, changing cpuset.cpus in the right place can cause 
rebuild_root_domains() to be called because the set of scheduling 
domains are changed.

Cheers,
