Another issue is that the V4L2 subsystem is plagued with lifetime
management problems. I don't think rust bindings could be safely written
for the MC and V4L2 subdev in-kernel APIs at the moment for instance.
Sakari recently attempted to fix some of those issues (again), see [1].
Progress is slow on this front because V4L2 is generally understaffed.

Now, I hope that mentioning "lifetime management problems" will be
enough to nerd-snipe a rust enthusiast or two to help fix the C code in
order to implement proper rust bindings on top ;-)

That would certainly be a required step, but I don't think it would be
enough. On good days I see the media subsystem as barely able to cope
with the current load, on bad days it feels it's completely collapsing.

We have homework to do when it comes to maintenance for the media
subsystem, we're doing *really* badly at the moment regarding community
management and attracting (and retaining) new core contributors. This is
a topic I really want to discuss face to face during the media workshop
in Prague (and I know that many people are looking forward to that
discussion).
