The whole "who is defconfig for" discussion always ends up kind of 
vague, but IIUC it's generally aimed at kernel hackers as opposed to end 
users -- so it's not meant to be a disto config, that's why we have 
things like the debug options turned on.  I tend to think of it as a "if 
a patch submitter is going to test only one config, then what do I want 
in it?" and let that determine what goes in defconfig.

IMO having defconfig contain the drivers necessary to boot every common 
dev board as =y, and having =m for anything else on those boards also 
seem reasonable.  That will make the transition from vendor/distro 
kernels to upstream a bit smoother, which is always good.  I guess 
there's some slight build time and image size issues, but aside from 
some very small systems that shouldn't be too bad for kernel developers 
-- and if we really end up with another popular system with 6MiB of RAM 
we can just stick another tiny defconfig in there for it.

I actually don't use modules when doing kernel development because I 
find it easier to track things when they're packed into a single binary, 
but I don't think it's necessary to steer everyone that way.

Adding some of the Arm folks here, in case they have thoughts.  The best 
bet is probably to try and do something similar, though my worry is that 
the answer is something like "target standard platforms" and we don't 
have any.
