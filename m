Yes, but I'm skeptical that compacting struct kvm_vcpu will actually result in
fewer cache lines being touched, at least not in a persistent, maintainable way.
While every VM-Exit accesses a lot of state, it's most definitely still a small
percentage of kvm_vcpu.  And for the VM-Exits that really benefit from optimized
handling, a.k.a. the fastpath exits, that percentage is even lower.

On x86, kvm_vcpu is actually comprised of three "major" structs: kvm_vcpu,
kvm_vcpu_arch, and vcpu_{vmx,svm}.  The majority of fields accessed on every VM-Exit
are in the vendor part, vcpu_{vmx,svm}, but there are still high-touch fields in
the common structures, e.g. registers in kvm_vcpu_arch and things like requests
in kvm_vcpu.

Naively compating any of the three (well, four) structures might result in fewer
cache lines being touched, but mostly by coincidence.  E.g. because compacting
part of kvm_vcpu_arch happened to better align vcpu_vmx, not because of the
compaction itself.

If we really wanted to optimize cache line usage, our best bet would be to identify
the fields that are accessed in the fastpath run loop and then pack those fields
into as few cache lines as possible.  And to do that in a maintainable way, we'd
probably need something like ASI[*] to allow us to detect changes that result in
the fastpath handling accessing fields that aren't in the cache-optimized region.

I'm not necessarily opposed to such aggressive optimization, but the ROI is likely
very, very low.  For optimized workloads, there simply aren't very many VM-Exits,
e.g. the majority of exits on a modern CPU are due to timer ticks.  And even those
will hopefully be eliminiated in the not-too-distant future, e.g. by having hardware
virtualize the TSC deadline timer, and by moving to a vCPU scheduling scheme that
allows for a tickless host.

TL;DR: not really.

What I've done in the past is run a very tight loop in the guest, and then measure
latency from the host by hacking KVM.  Measuring from the guest works, e.g. we have
a variety of selftests that do exactly that, but when trying to shave cycles in
the VM-Exit path, it doesn't take many host IRQs arriving at the "wrong" time to
skew the measurement.  My quick-and-dirty solution has always been to just hack
KVM to measure latency with IRQs disabled, but a more maintainable approach would
be to add smarts somewhere to sanitize the results, e.g. to throw away outliers
where the guest likely got interrupted.

I believe we've talked about adding a selftest to measure fastpath latency, e.g.
by writing MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE in a tight loop.

However, that's not going to be useful in this case since you are interested in
measuring the impact of reducing the host's L1D footprint.  If the guest isn't
cache-constrainted, reducing the host's cache footprint isn't going to impact
performance since there's no contention.

Running a micro benchmark in the guest that aims to measure cache performance might
work, but presumably those are all userspace tests, i.e. you'd end up measuring
the impact of the guest kernel too.  And they wouldn't consistently trigger VM-Exits,
so it would be difficult to prove the validity of the results.

I suppose you could write a dedicated selftest or port a micro benchmark to run
as a selftest (or KVM-unit-test)?

Heh, you might have picked quite possibly the worst way to measure VM-Exit
performance :-)

The guest code in that test that's measuring latency runs at L2.  For VMREADs
and VMWRITEs that are "passed-through" all the way to L2, no VM-Exit will occur
(the access will be handled purely in ucode).  And for accesses that do cause a
VM-Exit, I'm pretty sure they all result in a nested VM-Exit, which is a _very_
heavy path (~10k cycles).  Even if the exit is handled by KVM (in L0), it's still
a relatively slow, heavy path.

Ya.  Again, I'm definitely ok cleaning up the truly heinous warts and/or doing
a targeted, deliberate refactor of structures.  What I don't want to do is
shuffle fields around purely to save a few bytes here and there.
