You miss the fact that you can have 1-1-4. What buswidth do you use for 
dummy, the address buswidth or the data buswidth?

What happens if crazy protocols like 1S-1S-8D appear? What buswidth and 
transfer mode are you going to use for dummy?

And please don't tell me that "we're going to assume that dummy.buswidth 
= address.buswidth because that's what we currently do in SPI NOR", 
because I'm not convinced that the assumption is correct.
