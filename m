And you're right, for the first part of the comment (let's call that (1)):

	 * Ensure that if this updater saw a given reader's increment
	 * from __srcu_read_lock(), that reader was using an old value
	 * of ->srcu_idx.

My litmus test shows the ordering displayed in the second part of the comment
(call it (2)):

         * Also ensure that if a given reader sees the
	 * new value of ->srcu_idx, this updater's earlier scans cannot
	 * have seen that reader's increments (which is OK, because this
	 * grace period need not wait on that reader).

_ In (1), E indeed pairs with B and C
_ In (2), E pairs with the address-dependency between idx and lock_count.

Thanks.
