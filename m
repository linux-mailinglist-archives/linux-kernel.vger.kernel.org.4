Sorry about that, on it's own, it was fine, but merged with the
char-misc tree, there was a build issue, I had forgotten all about that.
I know we had already resolved one issue with merging this tree with the
DRM tree by reworking the DRM tree in advance, and that had pushed this
instance out of my memory.

In the future, how do you want stuff like "when this is merged with that
tree, something needs to be done" type of things to be pointed out?
linux-next keeps resolution patches around, do you want just a pointer
to that to make things easier?

And thanks for the fixup, it looks correct.
