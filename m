Oh that's a great idea, thanks for pointing it out Masami!

I rebased it on my branch
https://github.com/FlorentRevest/linux/commits/fprobe-min-args-3

And I got measurements again. Unfortunately it looks like this does not help :/

New benchmark results: https://paste.debian.net/1257856/
New perf report: https://paste.debian.net/1257859/

The fprobe based approach is still significantly slower than the
direct call approach.

That makes sense. :) How do you imagine the unified solution ?
Would both the fgraph and fprobe APIs keep existing but under the hood
one would be implemented on the other ? (or would one be gone ?) Would
we replace the rethook freelist with the function graph's per-task
shadow stacks ? (or the other way around ?))

I made slight progress on this. If I put the vmlinux file in the cwd
where I run perf report, the reports no longer contain references to
rethook_trampoline_handler. Instead, they have a few
0xffff800008xxxxxx addresses under fprobe_handler. (like in the
pastebin I just linked)

It's still pretty weird because that range is the vmalloc area on
arm64 and I don't understand why anything under fprobe_handler would
execute there. However, I'm also definitely sure that these 12% are
actually spent getting buffers from the rethook memory pool because if
I replace rethook_try_get and rethook_recycle calls with the usage of
a dummy static bss buffer (for the sake of benchmarking the
"theoretical best case scenario") these weird perf report traces are
gone and the 12% are saved. https://paste.debian.net/1257862/

This is why I would be interested in seeing rethook's memory pool
reimplemented on top of something like
https://lwn.net/Articles/788923/ If we get closer to the performance
of the the theoretical best case scenario where getting a blob of
memory is ~free (and I think it could be the case with a per task
shadow stack like fgraph's), then a bpf on fprobe implementation would
start to approach the performances of a direct called trampoline on
arm64: https://paste.debian.net/1257863/
