I was thinking we could initialize mmu_seq to '1' and make it a u64 to avoid
overflow.

The intent of checking mmu_seq is to flag cases where the caller doesn't specify
FOLL_GET and isn't protected by mmu_invalidate_seq, i.e. isn't tapped into the
mmu_notifiers.  I.e. this is a sanity check, not functionally necessary.

KVM would use a software available bit in its PTEs to explicitly track which SPTEs
point at refcounted pages.  E.g. I think bit 59 is available for EPT and 64-bit
paging.  PAE paging doesn't have high available bits, which is why I called out
that this would have to be 64-bit only.

Heh, because I got burned by this recently, using page_ref_count() is wrong.  This
needs to be page_count() so that tail pages of refcounted compound pages are
properly identified.

This would "work" from a functionality perspective, and might be acceptable as an
out-of-tree patch to unblock the ChromeOS use case, but I don't want to rely on
this heuristic on the backend in KVM because it will suppress any and all
use-after-free bugs in KVM's MMU (see patch 4 of this series).  I really want to
go in the opposite direction and harden KVM against MMU bugs, e.g. I'm planning
on posting the below (which is how I learned about page_count() vs. page_ref_count()).

Today, KVM gets partial protection from check_new_page_bad(), which detects *some*
cases where KVM marks a page dirty after the page is freed.  But it's racy, and
the detection occurs well after the fact since it fires only when the page is
re-allocated.

If we hack kvm_pfn_to_refcounted_page(), then all of those protections are lost
because KVM would drop its assertions and also skip dirtying pages, i.e. would
effectively suppress the latent detection by check_new_page_bad().

    KVM: Assert that a page's refcount is elevated when marking accessed/dirty
    
    Assert that a page's refcount is elevated, i.e. that _something_ holds a
    reference to the page, when KVM marks a page as accessed and/or dirty.
    KVM typically doesn't hold a reference to pages that are mapped into the
    guest, e.g. to allow page migration, compaction, swap, etc., and instead
    relies on mmu_notifiers to react to changes in the primary MMU.
    
    Incorrect handling of mmu_notifier events (or similar mechanisms) can
    result in KVM keeping a mapping beyond the lifetime of the backing page,
    i.e. can (and often does) result in use-after-free.  Yelling if KVM marks
    a freed page as accessed/dirty doesn't prevent badness as KVM usually
    only does A/D updates when unmapping memory from the guest, i.e. the
    assertion fires well after an underlying bug has occured, but yelling
    does help detect, triage, and debug use-after-free bugs.
    
    Note, the assertion must use page_count(), NOT page_ref_count()!  For
    hugepages, the returned struct page may be a tailpage and thus not have
    its own refcount.
