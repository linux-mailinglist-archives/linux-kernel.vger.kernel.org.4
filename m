For me personally, I have no objection to dropping qemu-system-i386 support in
future QEMU releases.  I update my 32-bit images very, very infrequently, so I
probably wouldn't even notice for like 5 years :-)

Right, but unless I seriously misunderstand what qemu-system-x86_64 ecompasses,
it can't be used to run guests of 32-bit _hosts_, which is what we need to test
shadowing of 32-bit NPT.
