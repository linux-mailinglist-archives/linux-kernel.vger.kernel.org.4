Yeah, I noticed yesterday, after I looked into the issue again, as it
looked stalled. But as I already wrote in a comment in the ticket
yesterday:

Did anyone tell the bfq developers about this?

Doesn't look like it. Adding them to the list of recipients them now,
even if they might know about it. If not:

Paolo, Jens, there seems to be a regression in BFQ likely introduced
between 5.19 and 6.0 that people apparently notice often with Btrfs. For
details see:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216961

Josef apparently has seen report about this as well where switching to
another io scheduler helped:

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
