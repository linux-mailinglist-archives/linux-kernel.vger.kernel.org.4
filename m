Hi,
That's not the problem, the sg is already mapped by V4L2 videobuf-dma-sg
(https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0/source/drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf-dma-sg.c#L285). 
With the original XDMA driver I was also not mapping the sg and it 
worked fine. And yes, I have tried it anyway and it didn't help ;-)

So there must be some other problem in your XDMA driver.

M.
