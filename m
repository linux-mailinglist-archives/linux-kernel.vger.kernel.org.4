I suspect they copied it from plx_dma driver that I wrote ;(, though
that driver uses rcu_dereference a bit more sparingly (only on stop,
issue_pending and when allocating and freeing a channel).

The dmaengine code didn't support hot unplug at all. I believe most
drivers are likely to crash if this happens. When I wrote the plx-dma
engine, I had to make a bunch of changes to dmaengine just so the
framework didn't crash when I tested this. The framework is pretty thin,
so there's not much to synchronize on to indicate other threads are not
in the middle of issuing new IO when a flag is set.

Almost all the dmaengine drivers use tasklets. I don't know if this is
the best approach, but my understanding was that it was due to needing
low latency in processing the completed descriptors, otherwise it can be
hard to reach the full bandwidth of the dma engine.
