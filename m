Not sure what you mean. The sev-guest driver has an internal buffer for 
receiving the certs, snp_dev->certs_data, and it would use that whenever 
it receives an SNP_GUEST_REQ_INVALID_LEN return code.

Correct.

Correct. But before returning the error to userspace, the sev-guest driver 
will issue the request again with its internal buffer so that the sequence 
numbers are updated and a new request can be issued.

Maybe for well-behaving user-space applications, but that's not 
guaranteed. I agree with Peter and think waiting in the sev-guest driver 
is the simplest and fairest thing to do in the case of throttling.
