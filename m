Not as invalid, as there might be a real issue here; but it's hard to
say, as among others it also quite possible that something else went
wrong (compiler? hardware?). Someone would have to investigate. But
given the fact that this happened with a stable kernel[1] and is
impossible to reproduce, I suspect no developer will be motivated enough
to do so. Then it's not worth tracking[2]:

#regzbot inconclusive: impossible to reproduce

Elmar, that's nothing bad. In case this turns out to be something you
can reproduce and bisect, just let us know and we'll add it back.

[1] see the sections about stable kernels
https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/post/frequent-reasons-why-linux-kernel-bug-reports-are-ignored/

[2] side note: due to limited resources I consider to stop tracking all
non-bisected issues in general (expect those that started to happen in
mainline since the last mainline release) â€“ or put them in a special
category that signals "those are collected here JFYI until they are
bisected, as the regression tracker due to limited resources for now
can't keep a close eye on these"

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
