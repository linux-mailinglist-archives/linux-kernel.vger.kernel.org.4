Hi Thomas,

Thank you for your review. You had me reopen ISO 11898-1 (haven't done
so for a long time).

I mostly agree with you. Many of your points are not related to this
patch but to the already existing definition. So I will handle these
in a separate patch.

I will prepare a v2 within the next few days.

ACK. I think I will put a reference to both naming (intermission and
IMF) and use the IMF forward for conciseness.

ISO 11898-1:2015 section 10.4.6 "Specification of inter-frame space"
makes it clear that the intermission is not part of the frame but part
of the "Inter-frame space".

To close the discussion, I would finally argue that the intermission
occurs after the EOF bit. Something after an "End of Frame" is not
part of the frame, right?

I agree with and will follow Thomas's suggestion.

ACK.

ACK. I double checked the standard, you are right.

Reading the ISO, the fixed bit stuff applies to the CRC field (which,
in the standard nomenclature, includes both the stuff count and the
CRC sequence).
The CRC field starts with a fixed stuff bit and then has another fixed
stuff bit after each fourth bit.

So the formula would be:

  FSB count = 1 + round_down(len(CRC field)/4)
            = 1 + round_down((len(stuff count) + len(CRC sequence))/4)

In case of CRC_17:

  FSB count = 1 + round_down((4 + 17)/4)
            = 6

This is coherent with the last figure of
https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/can/can-fd/ which shows 6 FSB
for CRC_17.

In case of CRC_21:

  FSB count = 1 + round_down((4 + 21)/4)
            = 7

So, ACK for Thomas, NACK for Marc (sorry :))
