Well, the code made just a wrong interpretation for the behavior with
silence_size == boundary.  This mode is actually a kind of tailored
operation for dmix.

In the description of alsa-lib snd_pcm_sw_params_set_silence_size(),
you can find it:

/**
 * \brief Set silence size inside a software configuration container
 * \param pcm PCM handle
 * \param params Software configuration container
 * \param val Silence size in frames (0 for disabled)
 * \return 0 otherwise a negative error code
 *
 * A portion of playback buffer is overwritten with silence when playback
 * underrun is nearer than silence threshold (see 
 * #snd_pcm_sw_params_set_silence_threshold)
 *
 * The special case is when silence size value is equal or greater than
 * boundary. The unused portion of the ring buffer (initial written samples
 * are untouched) is filled with silence at start. Later, only just processed
 * sample area is filled with silence. Note: silence_threshold must be set to zero.
 */

So, the "top-up" silencing happens only at start, but not after that.
In the code path of hw_ptr update, it doesn't check the appl_ptr any
longer, but fills the processed area by the hw_ptr update with
silence.  That's the intended behavior for use cases of free-wheel
mode without appl_ptr updates like dmix.
