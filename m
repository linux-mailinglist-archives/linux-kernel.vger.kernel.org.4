I don't think we can deal with asymmetric topologies without this.
Yes we can detect the difference in the CPU types but we can only assume
there are symmetric in terms of performance in absence of this property.

I would not say invalid. But surely absence of it must be handled and
we do that for sure. IIRC, here the presence of it is causing the issue.
And if it is present means someone is trying to build it(I do understand
this is Qemu but is quite common these days for power and performance
balance in many SoC)

Hmm I should have read all the messages in the thread. Doing by date/time
didn't work well for me ðŸ˜„.

Agreed, given how we faced similar issues with cacheinfo on few RISC-V
platforms.
