Mukesh will chime in once he looks at the hwtracing suggested by Linus W 
and see if it fits. Mukesh seems have already looked at pstore and 
discussions/patches are there w/ pstore logic I believe, but it is okay 
if they are not perfect if we are still not decided on the right 
framework. Best to decide if the existing frameworks fits or not or we 
need to create the new one.

I would still prefer if other SOC vendors chime in here, since I am sure 
in the Mobile and Embedded world various SOCs may have requirements to 
get specific portion of the ramdump only for the quick analysis and 
meeting the storage requirements on the device for its collection.

As mentioned on another patch, we are fine the submit abstract at LPC 
debug MC, but I would like the framework discussion to continue so that 
we can decide during the LPC that either existing frameworks fits the 
needs or they need to be extended or new fwk is needed.
