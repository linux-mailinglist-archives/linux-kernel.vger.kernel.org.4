Yes, this is what I was expecting. So now extent status tree is
inconsistent with the on-disk allocation info because the block 11 is
already allocated on disk but recorded as unallocated in the extent status
tree.

If the similar problem happened say when we punch a hole into a middle of a
written extent and so block on disk got freed but extent status tree would
still record it as allocated, user would be able to access freed block thus
potentially exposing sensitive data.

I guess there is some misunderstanding here. Both with
ext4_ext_map_blocks() and ext4_ind_map_blocks() we end up updating
i_reserved_data_blocks only after the blocks are successfully allocated and
inserted in the respective data structure but *before* updating extent
status tree. If extent status tree operation fails, we currently get
inconsistency between extent status tree and on-disk info in both cases
AFAICS. Am I missing something?
