Hi Uwe,

Could you confirm earlycon is enabled on your setup?

Without earlycon, boot is ok, even with dma properties, at least on 
stm32mp157c-dk2.

Hi Marek,

We haven't yet investigated the issue, and if latest DMA updates could 
explain why earlycon breaks the boot.


+TO Valentin, as he's now in charge of UART driver.
Valentin and I will investigate this issue.

Amelie
