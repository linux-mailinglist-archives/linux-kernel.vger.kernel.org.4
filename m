Thanks a lot for the patch.

I have found one more suspicious usage in arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S.
It calls soft_nmi_interrupt() which is defined in
powerpc/include/asm/nmi.h as well.

But it seems that it compiles even when asm/nmi.h is not included.
In fact, it has never been included. I have double checked this
with cross compilation.

So, this hopefully was the last build problem /o\

Petr
