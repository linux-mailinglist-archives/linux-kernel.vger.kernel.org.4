I was discussing this same idea with Marcelo yesterday morning.

The questions had in the topic were:
a - About how many pages the pcp cache will hold before draining them itsel=
f?=C2=A0
b - Would it cache any kind of bigger page, or huge page in this same aspec=
t?

Please let me know if I got anything wrong, but IIUC from a previous debug =
(a)'s
answer is 4 pages. Meaning even on bigger-page archs such as powerpc, with =
64k
pages, the max pcp cache 'wasted' on each processor would be 256k (very sma=
ll on
today's standard).

Please let me know if you have any info on (b), or any correcting on (a).

The thing is: having this drain_local_stock() waiver only for isolated cpus
would not bring the same benefits for non-isolated cpus in high memory pres=
sure
as I understand this patchset is bringing. =C2=A0

OTOH not running drain_local_stock() at all for every cpu may introduce
performance gains (no remote CPU access) but can be a problem if I got the
'wasted pages' could on (a) wrong. I mean, drain_local_stock() was introduc=
ed
for a reason.
