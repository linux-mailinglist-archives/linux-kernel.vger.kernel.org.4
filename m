Seems reasonable.

It's weird to me that the SMMU is between PCI and memory, but the
driver seems to insert itself in the middle after PCI enumeration.
And maybe even after some PCI device driver binding?  But I guess if
you arrange for the SMMU driver to configure the PF before the VF
driver gets started, that's all we need from a PCI perspective.
