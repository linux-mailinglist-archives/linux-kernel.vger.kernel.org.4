I have no permission to access the doc.  Please put the context in the commit
message.  It's usually helpful if you could put the corresponding EC FW
changes.

Is it a new feature?  How could the *error* recovery do?

I see.  There is still slightly change in disabling/enabling IRQ[2].  But I
think it would be fine as long as they are symmetric.

This doesn't sound good.  As I would suppose you are adding some new EC FW
features regarding to EC_CMD_HOST_SLEEP_EVENT, you should consider the
existing systems too.

What happens if a system uses older kernel (without this patch) to
communicate with new EC FW via LPC?

How about adding a new EC host command for your purpose so that it won't
affect the existing systems?  I knew this was discussed in some older series
but I didn't follow the thread.

Please don't top-posting next time.
