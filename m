Currently the 'interrupts' and 'interrupt-names' properties are defined
being too generic to really describe any actual IRQ interface. Moreover
the DW PCIe End-point devices are left with no IRQ signals. All of that
can be fixed by adding the IRQ-related properties to the common DW PCIe
DT-schemas in accordance with the hardware reference manual. The DW PCIe
common DT-schema will contain the generic properties definitions with just
a number of entries per property, while the DW PCIe RP/EP-specific schemas
will have the particular number of items and the generic resource names
listed.

Note since there are DW PCI-based vendor-specific DT-bindings with the
custom names assigned to the same IRQ resources we have no much choice but
to add them to the generic DT-schemas in order to have the schemas being
applicable for such devices. These names are marked as vendor-specific and
should be avoided being used in new bindings in favor of the generic
names.

Changelog v3:
- This is a new patch unpinned from the next one:
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220503214638.1895-2-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
  by the Rob' request. (@Rob)

Changelog v5:
- Add platform-specific interrupt names, but mark them as deprecated.

Changelog v6:
- Move the common interrupt-names definitions to the RP/EP schemas.
  Thus drop the 'definitions' property. (@Rob)
- Drop the 'deprecated' keywords from the vendor-specific names. (@Rob)

Changelog v7:
- Drop the dtschema tool 'lib.py' fix chunk from under the '---' pattern.
