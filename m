I think Ulf has already NACK'ed that approach here:
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAPDyKFon35wcQ+5kx3QZb-awN_S_q8y1Sir-G+GoxkCvpN=iiA@mail.gmail.com/

And suggested this new approach that this patch series proposes.
(Unless I missunderstood his point)

Well, this patchset only tries to delay the disabling of unused power
domains until all consumers have had a chance to probe. So we use sync
state only to queue up a power-off request to make sure those unused
ones get disabled.

I think we can circumvent looking at a GDSC by knowing it there was ever
a power on request since boot. I'll try to come up with something in the
new version.

Again, have a look at [1] (above).

Ulf, any thoughts on this 4th point?
