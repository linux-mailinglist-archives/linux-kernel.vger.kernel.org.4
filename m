That's why I said there could be other RMW operations outside of what
I carefully looked at. It, however, does not mean I didn't take any look 
at those.

But since brought it up, lets go through this case with
drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_hpc.c, it won't change anything:

All PCI_EXP_SLTSTA ones looked not real RMW but ACK bits type of writes
(real RMW = preverse other bits vs ACK write = other bits are written as 
zeros). Using RMW accessors would need an odd construct such as this
(and pcie_capability_set/clear_word() would be plain wrong):
	pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word(dev, PCI_EXP_SLTSTA,
					   ~PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_CC,
					   PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_CC);

PCI_EXP_SLTCTL write is protected by a mutex, it doesn't look something 
that matches your initial concern about "hot paths (e.g. interrupt 
handlers)".

In general, outside of drivers/pci/hotplug there are not that many 
capability writes (beyond LNKCTL/LNKCTL2 and now also RTCTL). None of 
those seem hot paths.

While it does feel entirely unnecessary layer of complexity to me, it would 
be possible to rename the original pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word() to 
pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word_unlocked() and add this into 
include/linux/pci.h:

static inline int pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word(struct pci_dev *dev,
					int pos, u16 clear, u16 set)
{
	if (pos == PCI_EXP_LNKCTL || pos == PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2 ||
	    pos == PCI_EXP_RTCTL)
		pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word_locked(...);
	else
		pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word_unlocked(...);
}

It would keep the interface exactly the same but protect only a selectable 
set of registers. As pos is always a constant, the compiler should be able 
to optimize all the dead code away.

Would that be ok then?
