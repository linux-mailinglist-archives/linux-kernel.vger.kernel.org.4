FWIW, there are still longstanding soundness issues in the arm64 pseudo-NMI
support (and fixing that requires an overhaul of our DAIF / IRQ flag
management, which I've been chipping away at for a number of releases), so I
hadn't looked at this in detail yet because the foundations are still somewhat
dodgy.

I appreciate that this has been around for a while, and it's on my queue to
look at.

Thanks,
Mark.
