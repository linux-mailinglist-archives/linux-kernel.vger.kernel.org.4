I didn't find these two issues to be the same until I researched the 
problem in
PATCH 3/3 and found that commit 9a8c5b0d0615 introduced a similar problem.
Then, it is found that the backup superblock is directly copied from the 
primary
superblock. If the backup superblock is faulty, the primary superblock 
must be
faulty. In this case, patch 1 that fixes the primary superblock problem 
is thought
of. So by rolling back commit 9a8c5b0d0615 to verify, I found that patch 
1 did
fix the problem.

Only ext4_flex_group_add() and ext4_group_extend_no_check() call
update_backups() to update the backup superblock. Both of these functions
correctly set the checksum of the primary superblock. The backup superblocks
that are copied from them are also correct.

In ext4_flex_group_add(), we only update the backup superblock if there 
are no
previous errors, indicating that we must have updated the checksum in
ext4_update_super() before executing update_backups(). The previous problem
was that after we updated the checksum in ext4_update_super(), we modified
s_overhead_clusters, so the checksums for both the primary and backup 
superblocks
were incorrect. This problem has been fixed in PATCH 1/3, so checksum is set
correctly in ext4_flex_group_add().

The same is true in ext4_group_extend_no_check(), we only update the backup
superblock if there are no errors, and we execute ext4_superblock_csum_set()
to update the checksum before updating the backup superblock. Therefore,
checksum is correctly set in ext4_group_extend_no_check().

I think we only need to ensure that the checksum is set correctly when 
the buffer
lock of sbi->s_sbh is unlocked. Therefore, the checksum should be 
correct before
update_backups() holds the buffer lock. Also, in update_backups() we 
copy the
entire superblock completely, and the checksum is unchanged, so we don't 
need
to reset it.
