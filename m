Processes that fork() with previous user_events need to be duplicated.

The fork() paths do not acquire the event_mutex. In the middle of a fork
an event could become enabled/disabled, which would call this part of
the code, at that time the list is actively being appended to when we
try to update the bits.

This is due to the fork() case above without taking the event_mutex. I
really tried to not cause fork() to stall if a process uses user_events.
This required using RCU, maybe there is a simpler approach:

One approach I can think of is that during fork() we don't add the newly
created mm to the global list until we copy all the enablers. The COW
pages should reflect the bits if a timing window occurs there, since I
believe it's impossible for the newly forked() mm to cause a COW during
that time. Then I can drop this RCU on the enablers.

The other places in the code that do this either will remove the event
depending on the situation during the for_each, or they only hold the
register lock and don't hold the event_mutex. So the disabler could get
removed out from under it.

IE: user_events_ioctl_reg() -> current_user_event_enabler_exists()

This is a place where we could just simply change to grab the
event_mutex, it's pretty isolated and we take the lock anyway further
down the path.
