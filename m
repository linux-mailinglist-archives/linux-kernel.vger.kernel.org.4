I would rather we cover 99.999% now.

My understanding is that the subdevices are flexible but fairly static 
and the frequency Lizhi mentions would cover development uses.

In production I would expect the image to change about once a year with 
the same order of magnitude as firmware.

Can you point me to a reference of a user case with high frequency 
images changing that also depends on pci io device changing?
