I did some very very basic testing today. Ethernet is still a no-go on
my visionfive 2 board, but the sd card works at least, so I can run w/
Zbb code people want & we can see how it goes!

At the very least, it is capable of executing the instructions that were
used in Appendix A. I didn't try to do anything else, because I am lazy
and if there were some pre-existing test programs I didn't want to go
and write out a bunch of asm myself!

impid appears to be 0x4210427, if that means anything to anyone!

Jess pointed out on IRC that GCC doesn't support XVentanaCondOps
so maybe there was a mixup there. I don't think that really matters
though, as the point stands regardless of whether it was in GCC or not.

Cool, thanks.
