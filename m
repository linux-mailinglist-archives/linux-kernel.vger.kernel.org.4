I should put both "waitqueue or spin" in the chart above to prevent misunderstanding.

I agree that S-EPT should be thought and treated differently than others as
any lock change on that path can affect the parallelization and performance. There are
many internal locks for protecting private data structures inside the security
firmware, like locks for TDR, TDCS, TDVPS. PAMT(mostly SEPT-related). Any contention
on these might result in a BUSY.

What I would like to clarify is: it would be better to have a mechanism to make sure a
SEAMCALL can succeed at a certain point (or at least trying to succeed) as the 
magic number would work like a lottery in reality. E.g. the CPU doing retry is running
at a higher freq than the CPU running the execution path which took the TDX inner
locks due to different P states. The retry loop might end much earlier than expectation.
Not even say when the same linux kernel binary with the same pre-determined number 
of retrying loop running on different CPU SKUs with different freqs.

We sometimes do retry in a driver to wait HW states ready is because the clock of a
device might be fixed or predictable. But I am in doubt if retrying loop works in the
case mentioned above.

It still likes a temporary workaround to me and I think we should be quite
careful of it.

That sharply hits the point. Let's keep this in mind and start from here.

I also saw the AMD SEV-SNP host patches had retry times like (2 * cpu cores).
But I haven't seen any explanation in the code and comment yet, like how it
supposes to be able to work in reality. Would ask this question in the patch
review. I start to feel this seems a common problem that needs to be sorted.
