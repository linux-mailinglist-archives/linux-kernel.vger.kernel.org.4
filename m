Many silicon vendors use the same "PCI IP" and integrate it into their
own chip. That's one of the reason why the capability doesn't really
reflect what actually being support.
The vendors then send their private datasheet to system integrator so
BIOS can enable what's really supported.

So the logic is to ignore the capability and trust the default set by BIOS.

For this case it means driver needs to provide a ASPM callback to flip
PTM based on ASPM sysfs.
