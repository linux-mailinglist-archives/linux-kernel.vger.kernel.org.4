Well, sure, because many people forgot to place them -- and this patch
is trying to change that for reasons outlined in the commit description.

Well, that would defeat the purpose of this patch -- and there is no
need to, as developers can still put Fixes: tag above or below the combo
of Reported-by: and Link:.

Well, that might be something nice to have (if Konstantin thinks it's
worth the trouble, as lkml.kernel.org likely needs to stick around
anyway to not break existing links). But that IMHO is something
independent of this patch-set, because the proper solution afaics then
would be to check all Link: tags in the commit message, not only those
next to a Reported-by.

Ciao, Thorsten
