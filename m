That doesn't answer my question.  I get that all of this is subject to perf
scheduling, I'm asking why perf doesn't communicate directly with KVM to coordinate
access to LBRs instead of pulling the rug out from under KVM.

Again, this doesn't answer my question.  I didn't suggest KVM write anything
directly, I asked why KVM doesn't try to re-enable the perf LBR event when emulating
a guest write to DEBUG_CTL.

Once again, this doesn't answer my question.  I want to know *exactly* when perf
can take control of the LBRs.  The fact that intel_pmu_handle_lbr_msrs_access()
disables IRQs when checking lbr_desc->event->state strongly suggests that the
answer isn't "when a task is scheduled in".

Your other response[1] mostly answered that question, but I want explicit documentation
on the contract between perf and KVM with respect to LBRs.  In short, please work
with Weijiang to fulfill my request/demand[*] that someone document KVM's LBR support,
and justify the "design".  I am simply not willing to take KVM LBR patches until that
documentation is provided.

Copy+pasting my request/demand for convenience:

  : First and foremost, the existing LBR support needs to be documented.  Someone,
  : I don't care who, needs to provide a detailed writeup of the contract between KVM
  : and perf.  Specifically, I want to know:
  : 
  :   1. When exactly is perf allowed to take control of LBR MRS.  Task switch?  IRQ?
  :      NMI?
  : 
  :   2. What is the expected behavior when perf is using LBRs?  Is the guest supposed
  :      to be traced?
  : 
  :   3. Why does KVM snapshot DEBUGCTL with IRQs enabled, but disables IRQs when
  :      accessing LBR MSRs?
  : 
  : It doesn't have to be polished, e.g. I'll happily wordsmith things into proper
  : documentation, but I want to have a very clear understanding of how LBR support
  : is _intended_ to function and how it all _actually_ functions without having to
  : make guesses.
  : 
  : And depending on the answers, I want to revisit KVM's LBR implementation before
  : tackling arch LBRs.  Letting perf usurp LBRs while KVM has the vCPU loaded is
  : frankly ridiculous.  Just have perf set a flag telling KVM that it needs to take
  : control of LBRs and have KVM service the flag as a request or something.  Stealing
  : the LBRs back in IRQ context adds a stupid amount of complexity without much value,
  : e.g. waiting a few branches for KVM to get to a safe place isn't going to meaningfully
  : change the traces.  If that can't actually happen, then why on earth does KVM need
  : to disable IRQs to read MSRs?
  : 
  : And AFAICT, since KVM unconditionally loads the guest's DEBUGCTL, whether or not
  : guest branches show up in the LBRs when the host is tracing is completely up to
  : the whims of the guest.  If that's correct, then again, what's the point of the
  : dance between KVM and perf?
