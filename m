We set PTR_TRUSTED in btf_ctx_access() for all PTR_TO_BTF_ID regs for
BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING and BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS. See [0]. Let me know
if I've misunderstood anything.

Currently I don't believe we set PTR_TRUSTED | MEM_ALLOC, so this won't
happen. I originally had this code doing:

	if (reg->type == PTR_TO_BTF_ID || reg->type & BPF_REG_TRUSTED_MODIFIERS) {

and it caused a bunch of the linked list tests to fail with:

verifier internal error: R0 has non-overwritten BPF_PTR_POISON type

Checking just PTR_TRUSTED avoids this (which I assume is what you were
worried about?). I'm happy to respin a patch that applies your
suggestion to do || PTR_TO_BTF_ID | PTR_TRUSTED, but to be honest I
don't think it buys us anything. That whole codepath where we take it
only in the event of no modifiers is kind of sketchy. Consider, e.g.,
that we're skipping this check if we don't take that path:

	if (!btf_struct_ids_match(&env->log, reg->btf, reg->btf_id, reg->off,
				  btf_vmlinux, *arg_btf_id,
				  strict_type_match)) {
		verbose(env, "R%d is of type %s but %s is expected\n",
			regno, kernel_type_name(reg->btf, reg->btf_id),
			kernel_type_name(btf_vmlinux, *arg_btf_id));
		return -EACCES;
	}

I know we check it elsewhere such as in map_kptr_match_type() and
process_kf_arg_ptr_to_list_node(), but it feels pretty brittle to say:
"Check it only if there are no modifiers set, else check it later in
some helper-specific logic". I'd prefer to keep the check as broad as
possible for now, and then refactor and clean this up. Lmk if you
disagree.

These are all reasonable observations, but we went into them
intentionally. Eventually the goal is to have PTR_TRUSTED be the single
source of truth for whether a pointer is trusted or not. See [1] for the
thread with the discussions.

I agree that I don't believe that MEM_ALLOC | PTR_TRUSTED can be set
together yet, but eventually they should and will be. Conceptually, the
behavior of check_func_arg_reg_off() should be the same for
PTR_TO_BTF_ID, PTR_TO_BTF_ID | MEM_ALLOC | PTR_TRUSTED, PTR_TO_BTF_ID |
PTR_TRUSTED, etc, so IMO it's correct to add that case to
check_func_arg_reg_off() even if it's not yet used. Not adding it
because no callers currently happen to require it is IMO a bit brittle.

100% agreed. There are plans to clean this up, see the link above.
