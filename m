This is reportedly a problem because memory.reclaim interface cannot be
used for proper memcg sizing IIRC.

For the further discussion it would be useful to reference the usecase
that is requiring this functionality. I believe this has been mentioned
somewhere but having it in this thread would help.

Yes, proactive promotion is not backed by any real usecase at the
moment. We do not really have to focus on it but we should be aware of
the posibility and alow future extentions towards that functionality.
 
There is one requirement missing here.
 - Per NUMA node control - this is what makes the distinction between
   demotion and charge reclaim really semantically challenging - e.g.
   should demotions constrained by the provided nodemask or they should
   be implicit?

The question is not whether but when IMHO. We've had a similar situation
with the swap accounting. Originally we have considered swap as a shared
resource but cgroupv2 goes with per swap limits because contention for
the swap space is really something people do care about.

I thought we are aligned on that. Demotion is a part of aging and that
is an integral part of the reclaim.

Johannes made some very strong arguments that there is no other choice
than involve kswapd (https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y5nEQeXj6HQBEHEY@cmpxchg.org/).

I suspect we are left with a real usecase and then follow the path we
took for the swap accounting.

Other open questions I do see are
- what to do when the memory.reclaim is constrained by a nodemask as
  mentioned above. Is the whole reclaim process (including aging) bound to
  the given nodemask or does demotion escape from it.
- should the demotion be specific to multi-tier systems or the interface
  should be just NUMA based and users could use the scheme to shuffle
  memory around and allow numa balancing from userspace that way. That
  would imply that demotion is a dedicated interface of course.
- there are other usecases that would like to trigger aging from
  userspace (http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20221214225123.2770216-1-yuanchu@google.com).
  Isn't demotion just a special case of aging in general or should we
  end up with 3 different interfaces?
