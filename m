OK, I think I got it.

No, they are not the same device. For example, GMAC1(on chip PCI device) and
GPIO(platform device, not PCI device) 14 use the same pin. The function for
this pin can be configured by one bit in general register, eg, 0 for GPIO 14,
1 for GMAC1. Sometimes, GPIO 14 is preferred, so configure the pin with
function GPIO 14 and disable GMAC1.

In fact, I want to describe an solution. But it seems that I described a
little confusing and please check the refactored commit log in the
following comments.

You are right and I did something ugly in pdev_may_exist() in my kernel. I
really don't want to continue doing this, so I am developing this patch.

Also I don't want to remove pdev_may_exist(). This patch could replace
pdev_may_exist() only in DT, but pdev_may_exist() matters in both ACPI and DT.

Overall, how about the following refactored commit log:

"This patch adds a mechanism to disable on chip PCI devices by DT. Typically,
when there are pins shareable between the platform device and the on chip PCI
device, if the PCI device is not preferred, add `status = "disabled"` property
to this PCI device DT node.

For example, on LS2K1000, GMAC1(on chip PCI device) and GPIO(platform device,
not PCI device) 14 share the same pin. If GMAC1 is not preferred, add
`status = "disabled"` property in GMAC1 DT node."

Peibao
