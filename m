Note about that: with your series applied, nothing was working for me on
my pine Rockpro64 board (AMD Ryzen host). I got weird/unstable behavior
and the host IOMMU screaming about IO page faults due to the endpoint
doing weird pci accesses. Running the host with IOMMU on really helps in
debugging this stuff :)

With the few fixes to your series I commented about, things started to
work better, but still very unstable. More debugging and I found out that
the pci-epf-test drivers, both host and endpoint sides, have nasty
problems that lead to reporting failures when things are actually working,
or outright dummy things being done that trigger errors (e.g. bad DMA
synchronization triggers IOMMU page faults reports). I have a dozen fix
patches for these drivers. Will clean them up and post ASAP.

With the test drivers fixed + the fixes to your series, I have the
pci_test.sh tests passing 100% of the time, repeatedly (in a loop). All solid.

However, I am still seeing issues with my ongoing work with a NVMe
endpoint driver function: I see everything working when the host BIOS
pokes at the NVMe "drive" it sees (all good, that is normal), but once
Linux nvme driver probe kicks in, IRQs are essentially dead: the nvme
driver does not see anything strange and allocates IRQs (1 first, which
ends up being INTX, then multiple MSI one for each completion queue), but
on the endpoint side, attempting to raise MSI or INTX IRQs result in error
as the rockchip-ep driver sees both INTX and MSI as disabled. No clue what
is going on. I suspect that a pci reset may have happened and corrupted
the core configuration. However, the EPC/EPF infrastructure does not
catch/process PCI resets as far as I can tell. That may be the issue.
I do not see this issue with the epf test driver, because I suspect the
host BIOS not knowing anything about that device, it does not touch it.
This all may depend on the host & BIOS. Not sure. Need to try with
different hosts. Just FYI :)
