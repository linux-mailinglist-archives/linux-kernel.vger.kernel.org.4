The aperture is easily fixed (one could argue that what's broken there 
are the ARM DMA ops for assuming every IOMMU has a 32-bit IOVA space and 
not checking).

That's true, and the domain is tiny and not isolated from the rest of 
the address space outside the aperture, but the one thing it does do is 
support iommu_map/unmap just fine, which is what this flag is documented 
as saying it doesn't.

And yet they all have other in-tree users (GPUs on MSM and Tegra, 
remoteproc on OMAP) that allocate unmanaged domains and use 
iommu_map/unmap just fine, so they're clearly not broken either.

On the flipside, you're also missing cases like apple-dart, which can 
have broken unmanaged domains by any definition, but only under certain 
conditions (at least it "fails safe" and they will refuse attempts to 
attach anything). I'd also question sprd-iommu, which hardly has a 
generally-useful domain size, and has only just recently gained the 
ability to unmap anything successfully. TBH none of the SoC IOMMUs are 
likely to ever be of interest to VFIO or IOMMUFD, since the only things 
they could assign to userspace are the individual devices - usually 
graphics and media engines - that they're coupled to, whose useful 
functionality tends to depend on clocks, phys, and random other 
low-level stuff that would be somewhere between impractical and 
downright unsafe to attempt to somehow expose as well.

"uses UNMANAGED domains for the IOMMU API" is literally the definition 
of unmanaged domains :/

Some "other SOC drivers" use more of the IOMMU API than VFIO does :/

Please just add IOMMU_CAP_IOMMUFD to represent whatever the nebulous 
requirements of IOMMUFD actually are (frankly it's no less informative 
than calling domains "broken"), handle that in the drivers you care 
about and have tested, and use device_iommu_capable(). What you're 
describing in this series is a capability, and we have a perfectly good 
API for drivers to express those already. Plus, as demonstrated above, a 
positive capability based on empirical testing will be infinitely more 
robust than a negative one based on guessing.

Thanks,
Robin.
