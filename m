This is uart0 which is at first defined in bcm283x.dtsi. On the 
Raspberry Pi 4 this UART is connected to the Bluetooth IC. On Linux 
probing of the serial communication via DT is done via serial device bus 
(see bcm283x-rpi-wifi-bt.dtsi).

I assume the link is established by raspberry,firmware-gpio which 
provides the necessary BT shutdown-gpios defined in bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts. 
Seems to me that the problem is, that necessary underlying firmware 
driver is probed "too late":

[ 15.456506] raspberrypi-firmware soc:firmware: Attached to firmware 
from 2020-02-12T12:36:21

Hope this helps a little bit
