In my debug attempts I've actually completely removed this unlocked check
and the corruption still triggered.

This shouldn't be needed, at least once unlocked checks are removed. Also
even if they stay, the list should never get corrupted because all the
modifications are protected by the spinlock. This is why we eventually
pointed to the rt_mutex as the problem.

It may be possible that your change adds enough memory ordering so that the
missing ordering in rt_mutex does not matter anymore.

Looks like another list corruption - in this case ext4 list of inodes that
are undergoing truncate.

Both had the same Ampere CPU. Full cpuinfo is here:
