This is a final patchset in the series created in the framework of
my Baikal-T1 PCIe/eDMA-related work:

[1: Done v5] PCI: dwc: Various fixes and cleanups
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220624143428.8334-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
Merged: kernel 6.0-rc1
[2: Done v4] PCI: dwc: Add hw version and dma-ranges support
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220624143947.8991-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
Merged: kernel 6.0-rc1
[3: Done v7] PCI: dwc: Add generic resources and Baikal-T1 support
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20221113191301.5526-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
Merged: kernel 6.2-rc1
[4: In-review v9] dmaengine: dw-edma: Add RP/EP local DMA controllers support
Link: ---you are looking at it---

Note it is very recommended to merge the patchsets in the same order as
they are listed in the set above in order to have them applied smoothly.
Since the patchsets 1-3 have already been merged into the mainline kernel
this series can be applied via any DMA-engine or PCI repos.

Here is a short summary regarding this patchset. The series starts with
fixes patches. We discovered that the dw-edma-pcie.c driver incorrectly
initializes the LL/DT base addresses for the platforms with not matching
CPU and PCIe memory spaces. It is fixed by using the pci_bus_address()
method to get a correct base address. After that you can find a series of
the interleaved xfers fixes. It turned out the interleaved transfers
implementation didn't work quite correctly from the very beginning for
instance missing src/dst addresses initialization, etc. In the framework
of the next two patches we suggest to add a new platform-specific
callback - pci_address() and use it to convert the CPU address to the PCIe
space address. It is at least required for the DW eDMA remote End-point
setup on the platforms with not-matching CPU/PCIe address spaces. In case
of the DW eDMA local RP/EP setup the conversion will be done automatically
by the outbound iATU (if no DMA-bypass flag is specified for the
corresponding iATU window). Then we introduce a set of the patches to make
the DebugFS part of the code supporting the multi-eDMA controllers
platforms. It starts with several cleanup patches and is closed joining
the Read/Write channels into a single DMA-device as they originally should
have been. After that you can find the patches with adding the non-atomic
io-64 methods usage, dropping DT-region descriptors allocation, replacing
chip IDs with the device name. In addition to that in order to have the
eDMA embedded into the DW PCIe RP/EP supported we need to bypass the
dma-ranges-based memory ranges mapping since in case of the root port DT
node it's applicable for the peripheral PCIe devices only. Finally at the
series closure we introduce a generic DW eDMA controller support being
available in the DW PCIe Root Port/Endpoint driver.
