Best effort is OK but it shouldn't create an unexpected behavior and
this approach does that.

I thought I have already explained that. But let me be more
explicit this time.  Please have a look at how controllers can be
enabled/disabled at different levels of the hierarchy. Unless memcg
grows a hard dependency on another controller (as it does with the blk
io controller) then this approach can point to a wrong cpuset. See my
point?

Really, solution for this is not going to be cheap and also I am not
sure all the hessles is really worth it until there is a clear usecase
in sight.
