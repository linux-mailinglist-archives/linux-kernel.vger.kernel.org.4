No, I didn't implement those deadlock selftests out of xen_shinfo_test
because there was some problem. I just wanted to have a cleaner workspace
and then, maybe, move them to xen_shinfo_test, which, well, did not happen
:) I guess there's no need for them filthy races anymore; lockdep does a
better job.

I fully agree. And sorry for late reply.

Could it be that deadlocks_test starts with the right conditions, i.e.
invalid KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO along with valid
KVM_XEN_VCPU_ATTR_TYPE_VCPU_INFO? xen_shinfo_test, on the other hand, have
them both valid, and so the fast path is taken.

I suppose instead of changing memslots, you can invalidate the
KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO for that particular test unit, e.g.

	struct kvm_xen_hvm_attr ha = {
		.type = KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO,
		.u.shared_info.gfn = KVM_XEN_INVALID_GFN,
	};
	vm_ioctl(vm, KVM_XEN_HVM_SET_ATTR, &ha);

One more thing concerning the lockdep priming you did in kvm_create_vm();

	mutex_lock(&kvm->lock);
	synchronize_srcu(&kvm->srcu);
	mutex_unlock(&kvm->lock)

It seems that deadlocks_test's set_msr_filter() effectively did the same
thanks to kvm_vm_ioctl_set_msr_filter()'s sync-under-mutex (which won't
happen if those I-used-to-be-a-deadlock optimization patches[*] get
merged). Naturally, xen_shinfo_test do not mess with MSR filters, so that
could be another reason for inconsistencies you've noticed before the
priming?
