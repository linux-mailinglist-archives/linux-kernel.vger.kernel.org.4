Sure, I can take these on top.

Thanks!

As far as I can tell, GCC has been doing the right thing here, and it's
instead been objtool getting confused by weak noreturns.  That gets
fixed later in patch 9.

Good catch, patch 1 does introduce the warning.  I think I'll just
squash patches 1 and 2 so as not to break bisection.

Hopefully not, it's best to not introduce warnings even temporarily.  I
was doing a lot of build testing at the time with various branches, so
it's possible.  I'll see if I can figure out how I triggered those
warnings and document that in the commit logs if possible.
