Hi Vincenzo,

Thanks for raising this issue.  Let's see what we can do to address
it.

It sounds like this happens with several endpoints, right?  And I
assume the endpoints work fine in other non-Rockchip systems?  If
that's the case, my guess is the problem is with the Rockchip host
controller and how it's initialized, not with the endpoints.

The only delays and timeouts I see in the driver now are in
rockchip_pcie_host_init_port(), where it waits for link training to
complete.  I assume the link training did completely successfully
since you don't mention either a gen1 or gen2 timeout (although the
gen2 message is a dev_dbg() that normally wouldn't go to the console).

I don't know that the spec contains a retrain timeout value.  Several
other drivers use 1 second, while rockchip uses 500ms (for example,
see LINK_RETRAIN_TIMEOUT and LINK_UP_TIMEOUT).

I think we need to understand the issue better before adding a DT
property and a module parameter.  Those are hard for users to deal
with.  If we can figure out a value that works for everybody, it would
be better to just hard-code it in the driver and use that all the
time.

A few minor style/formatting comments below just for future reference:

Include only the parts of the crash dump that are needed to debug the
problem or identify the problem enough to find this patch.  Timestamps
probably aren't necessary.  Register contents -- probably not either.

The rest of the backtrace (below here) probably isn't useful.

Generally speaking module-specific stuff like this doesn't get
documented in kernel-parameters.txt.

Please follow comment style in the file, i.e.,

  /*

Wrap comments to fill 78 columns or so to match the rest of the file.

I don't think we want to just add a random delay here that's not
connected to anything else.  I assume it could go in
rockchip_pcie_host_init_port() or perhaps rockchip_pcie_init_port()
(which deasserts resets, and there are usually timing constraints
related to deasserting resets).  Hopefully Shawn can shed some light
on this.

This should go right next to the bus_scan_delay definition above.

I hope we don't need this property at all, but if we do, I assume it
should be optional, with no message needed if it's not present.

We need better understanding of what's going on here.  Then this
