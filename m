I'm not sure if I can follow you here. Can you elaborate?

I am aware that my platform is not a role model for the others. But I've ye=

to get information what is actually different on other platforms.

How is it necessary? How do these PCI devices get attaches to the pci_bus_t=
ype=20
bus without calling pci_bus_add_device?

Okay, so which dependency is provided by pci_sysfs_init, which are required=
 by=20
drivers then?
