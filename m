It's not an EPT violation if there's a triple fault.  Given that you're dumping
the VMCS from handle_triple_fault(), I assume that L2 gets an unexpected #PF that
leads to a triple fault in L2.

Just to make sure we're on the same page: L1 is still alive after this, correct?

Before we start putting bandaids on this, let's (a) confirm this appears to be
an issue with ESXi and (b) pull in VMware folks to get their input.

Does the host in question support UMIP?

Can you capture a tracepoint log from L1 to verify that L1 KVM is _not_ injecting
any kind of exception?  E.g. to get the KVM kitchen sink:

  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kvm/enable

  cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace > log

Or if that's too noisy, a more targeted trace (exception injection + emulation)
woud be:

  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on

  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kvm/kvm_emulate_insn/enable
  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kvm/kvm_inj_exception/enable
  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kvm/kvm_entry/enable
  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kvm/kvm_exit/enable

A chicken bit isn't a good solution for this sort of thing.  Toggling a KVM module
param requires (a) knowing that it exists and (b) knowing the conditions under which
it is/isn't safe to toggle the bit.

E.g. if this ends up being an ESXi L0 bug, then an option might be to add something
in vmware_platform_setup() to communicate the bug to KVM so that KVM can precisely
disable the optimization on affected platforms.
