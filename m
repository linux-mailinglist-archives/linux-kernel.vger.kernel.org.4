Well. The DMA-engine is embedded into the PCIe Root Port bus, is associated
with the platform device it's embedded to, and it doesn't have
anything to do with any particular PCI device.

Really? I find it otherwise. Please see the way the "dma-ranges"
property is parsed and works during the device-specific memory ranges
mapping when it's applicable for the PCIe Root Ports.

Hold on with that angry tone. First of all I don't really see you
fixing the drivers/dma/ti/k3-udma.c driver then. Second read more
carefully the patch log. Judging by your comments you don't fully
understand the problem.

That's what is in my patches. The problem is that the "dma-ranges"
property specified for the parental PCIe Root Port device isn't
applicable for the DMA-engine embedded into it. The "dma-ranges" is
supposed to be used for the PCIe-bus peripheral devices since their
MRw/MRd TLPs are translated by means of the Inbound iATU engine. The
IO accesses generated by the PCIe controller itself aren't affected by
iATU. So any mapping performed for the PCIe Root Port controller
platform device mustn't take these DMA-ranges into account. That's why
I need to enable the "chan_dma_dev" DMA-engine capability and just
copy the main DMA-parts of the parental device except the
"dma_range_map" data. If you have any better suggestion in mind
please share, but what you've said so far definitely won't give us any
explicit solution.
