I've never understood why the compiler wants to make a copy of a
register variable into another register!? >:#

Yeah that's not good.

I suspect the compiler developers will tell us to go jump :)

The problem of the compiler caching r13 has come up in the past, but I
only remember it being "a worry" rather than causing an actual bug.

We've had the DEBUG_PREEMPT checks in get_paca(), which have given us at
least some comfort that if the compiler is caching r13, it shouldn't be
doing it in preemptable regions.

But obviously that doesn't help at all with the stack protector check.

I don't see an easy fix.

Adding "volatile" to the definition of local_paca seems to reduce but
not elimate the caching of r13, and the GCC docs explicitly say *not* to
use volatile. It also triggers lots of warnings about volatile being
discarded.

Short term we can make stack protector depend on !PREEMPT.

Longer term possibly we can move to having current in a register like
32-bit does, and then use that as the stack protector reg.

Or something simple I haven't thought of? :)

cheers
