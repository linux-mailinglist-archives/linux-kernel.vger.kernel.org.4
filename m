If we go by Intel's statement that only unbalanced RETs are a concern,
that *might* be ok as long as there's a nice comment above the
FILL_RETURN_BUFFER usage site describing the two purposes for the
LFENCE.

However, based on Andy's concerns, which I've discussed with him
privately (but I'm not qualified to agree or disagree with), we may want
to just convert vmx_spec_ctrl_restore_host() to asm.  Better safe than
sorry.  My original implementation of that function was actually asm.  I
can try to dig up that code.
