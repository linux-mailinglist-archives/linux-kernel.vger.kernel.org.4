I don't think so. The pt_event_stop() doesn't save all the
MSR_IA32_RTIT_* MSRs.

The pt_event_stop() and the proposed interface still manipulate the PT
event pt->handle.event. The event status is updated as well. It's still
under control of the perf_event.
While the current KVM implementation implicitly updates the MSRs without
updating the event status.

Also, KVM doesn't know the PT as well as the PT driver. It's better to
let the dedicated driver maintain the details. Otherwise, if we add more
MSRs later, we have to maintain both KVM and PT.

Thanks,
Kan
