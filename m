Existing NVMe driver expecting NVMe device to be in D0 during S3 also. 
If we turn off the link in
suspend, the NVMe resume path is broken as the state machine is getting 
reset in the NVMe device.
Due to this, the host driver state machine and the device state machine 
are going out of sync, and all NVMe commands
after resumes are getting timed out.

IIRC, Tegra is also facing this issue with NVMe.

This issue has been discussed below threads:

This is a Qcom PHY-specific feature (retaining the link state in L1.x 
with clocks turned off).
It is possible only with the link being in l1.x. PHY can't retain the 
link state in L0 with the
clocks turned off and we need to re-train the link if it's in L2 or L3. 
So we can support this feature only with L1.x.
That is the reason we are taking l1.x as the trigger to turn off clocks 
(in only suspend path).

Someone in one of the previous patch asked to include this in the commit 
text.
