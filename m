There's nothing fundamentally new here. You are claiming the common
practice of looking at the audit trail to develop "policy" is a new
"alternative notion" for security. You are familiar with SELinux's
audit2allow I assume.

I read this as an argument for using CAP_MAC_ADMIN.

This is (to my simple mind) indistinguishable from the way SELinux is
used in distributions. SELinux does not require a CAP_TRUST, and only
uses CAP_MAC_ADMIN in certain unlikely error conditions which I believe
you don't encounter.

If you're giving the workload process chain the ability to modify the
configuration of another LSM you are already on marshy ground.
