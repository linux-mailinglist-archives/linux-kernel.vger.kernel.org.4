Dude, are you even reading what I'm writing to you?!

I don't care how immersed you were in the problem and who asked or
didn't ask you to elaborate your logs. If you're submitting patches
to the EDAC tree, those logs need to be complete and explain things
sufficiently and exactly. Period.

And I can't read yours too. And I asked like three times already. And
yet, you still are not giving me a concrete answer.

I said "exact pointers please". That means, you point me to a driver and
the *exact* *code* in there which you think is doing something which
needs fixing.

What you've given me again is the same spiel as before.

So let me save you and me some time: your patches are not going anywhere
until they explain the thing they're fixing properly and precisely. End
of story.
