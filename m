Another fake event? We have to specially handle it in the perf code. I
don't think it's a clean way for perf.

Why we cannot use the same way as the perf core driver to switch the
MSRs in the VMCS?

You just need one generic function, perf_guest_get_msrs(), for both PT
and core driver. If you have to disable PT explicitly before VMCS, I
think you can do it in the PT specific perf_guest_get_msrs().

Anyway, that's an improvement for the current code. I don't have a
problem, if you prefer to separate the fix patch and improvement patch.

Thanks,
