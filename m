Sure. But your argument is inappropriate: You could as well argue that
this system with a single fan should bundle all its thermal sensors into
a single thermal zone, and that it should do so in the driver(s)
providing the thermal zone sensors to the thermal subsystem. This does
not take into account that there might be systems with dozens (or hundreds,
for that matter) of drives, in a system with multiple disk trays and fans
for each of those.

I don't know if and how the thermal subsystem deals with the situation
of having N thermal zone sensors and M << N cooling devices. This is
a general problem, not limited to disk drives. Just as we won't bundle
multiple thermal sensors on a multi-channel thermal sensor chip into a
single thermal zone, we won't bundle multiple disk drives into a single
thermal zone.

In theory it should work just like described in the kirkwood devicetree
files. If that doesn't work, the question is how to find the sata port
nodes from the drivetemp driver. I don't have a system with such nodes,
so I have no means to find or know the answer.

I also don't know how to attach more than one thermal sensor to a
single thermal zone, or if that is even possible. If it isn't, it
is a limitation of the thermal subsystem, and trying to hack around
it in a driver providing thermal sensors would be inappropriate.
