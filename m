I think that it's possible for different processes have different
requirements.

- Some processes don't care about where the memory is placed, prefer
  local, then fall back to remote if no free space.

- Some processes want to avoid cross-socket traffic, bind to nodes of
  local socket.

- Some processes want to avoid to use slow memory, bind to fast memory
  node only.

Yes.  Per-mm or per-vma property is much better than per-task property.
Another possibility, how about add a new flag to set_mempolicy() system
call to set the per-mm mempolicy?  `numactl` can use that by default.
