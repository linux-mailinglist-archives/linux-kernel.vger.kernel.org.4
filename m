Yes! There is an inconsistency here, but do_writepages finds that the 
writeback
returns -ENOMEM and keeps retrying until it succeeds, at which point the
above inconsistency does not exist.

ext4_punch_hole
   // remove extents in extents status tree
   ext4_es_remove_extent
   // remove extents tree on disk
   ext4_ext_remove_space

In this scenario, we always try to delete the extents in the in-memory 
extents
status tree first, and then delete the extents tree on disk. So even if 
we fail in
deleting extents in memory, there is no inconsistency, am I missing 
something?

Yes, our code is indeed designed to only update the number of reserved 
blocks
after the block allocation is complete. We have different treatment for 
extent
based file and non-extent based file in commit 5f634d064c70 ("ext4: Fix 
quota
accounting error with fallocate").

For extent based file, we update the number of reserved blocks before the
"got_allocated_blocks" tag after the blocks are successfully allocated in
ext4_ext_map_blocks().

For the non-extent based file we update the number of reserved blocks after
ext4_ind_map_blocks() is executed, which leads to the problem that when 
we call
ext4_ind_map_blocks() to create a block, it does not always create a block.
For example, if the extents status tree we encountered earlier does not 
match
the extents tree on disk, this is of course a problem in itself, but in 
terms of code
logic, updating the number of reserved blocks as ext4_ext_map_blocks() does
can prevent us from trying to create a block and not creating it, 
resulting in an
incorrect number of reserved blocks.


Thank you very much for your patient explanation!
