IOMMUs typically wouldn't be reflected here - in fact they would 
typically hide this issue anyway, since inbound DMA would then be to 
virtual addresses anywhere in PCI Mem space (and we try our best to 
carve out the regions used for outbound resources). However there 
certainly exist systems where the PCI host bridge itself makes a static 
non-identity translation between PCI Mem space and system PA space, with 
potentially different mappings for inbound vs. outbound as well. So 
indeed, this code looks wrong - at the very least any consideration of 
region->offset is missing (assuming that's initialised correctly in this 
context), but that still won't account for inbound translation.

In fact this is really the same thing as in the recent discussions of 
the MSI thing in the DWC driver - it's all a matter of whether a bus 
address may overlap a valid DMA address or not. A mechanism for making 
that check properly would go hand-in-hand with the mechanism we need for 
allocating such bus addresses for inline MSI widgets.

Thanks,
Robin.
