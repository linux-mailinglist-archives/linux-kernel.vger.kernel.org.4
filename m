Apologies on the delayed response, vacation and what not.

I believe I know where the confusion is coming from, let me see if I can 
explain better by why that field came about. The motivation for the SLRT 
came out of our agreement to use a callback mechanism to support 
entering efi-stub and then going back to a dynamic launch aware hook to 
complete the initiation of the dynamic launch. The SLRT was devised as a 
platform and kernel agnostic means to handle the launch. As such, there 
was a desire to use that interface, and the underlying DLE code, whether 
GRUB was launching the kernel via the UEFI interface or the traditional 
interface. Skipping the details, but it boils down to the fact that in 
the non-UEFI case, functionality from core GRUB was needed. As a result, 
to provide maximum flexibility for other bootloaders, and to make it 
easier on us, we add the ability to pass a context object across the 
interface. Thus allowing GRUB's DLE handler to have a single entry that 
could be called externally by efi-stub or directly from GRUB proper.

IOW, the bootloader context is a means to provide a bootloader with them 
means to implement a private interface between the bootloader proper and 
a DLE handler that it installed into memory should its implementation 
require it.

There is an underlying question within your question, and that is of 
reuse. In this case, we wrote GRUB's DLE handler was written 
specifically to be used by GRUB. It was written to provide a stable and 
demonstrable implementation of the SL interface. In the future it may 
get refactored or a common standalone implementation, e.g., the 
previously mentioned UEFI runtime service, may arise that would be 
reusable by multiple bootloaders.

I hope this helped explain the purpose and use of this area of the 
table. Please let me know if it did not.

V/r,
DPS
