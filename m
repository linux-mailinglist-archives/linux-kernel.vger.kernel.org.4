Note that it's not only for perf, but also task_struct.maj_flt|min_flt.

If we check the reasoning of "why ERROR shouldn't be accounted for perf
events", there're actually something valid in the comment:

	 * - Unsuccessful faults (e.g. when the address wasn't valid).  That
	 *   includes arch_vma_access_permitted() failing before reaching here.
	 *   So this is not a "this many hardware page faults" counter.  We
	 *   should use the hw profiling for that.

IMHO it suggests that if someone wants to trap either ERROR or RETRY one
can use the hardware counters instead.  The same reasoning just sounds
applicable to vm events too, because vm events are not special in this case
to me.

I don't have a strong opinion either.  We used to change this path before
for perf events and task events and no one complains with the change.  I'd
just bet the same to vm events:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200707225021.200906-1-peterx@redhat.com/

Please feel free to keep it as-is if you still feel unsafe on changing
ERROR handling.  If so, would you mind slightly modify [1] above explaining
why we need ERROR to be accounted for vm accountings with the reasoning?
Current comment only says "what it does" rather than why.

Thanks,
