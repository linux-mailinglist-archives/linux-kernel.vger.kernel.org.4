Um, I'm guessing that bug reports that go to bpf@vger are focused on issues
with BPF and not core kernel infrastructure. No, I do not consider BPF (nor
tracing for that matter) as core infrastructure. The bug reports I'm
talking about is for the scheduler, exception handling, interrupts, VFS,
MM, and networking. When one of these have a bug report, you most
definitely do look at taints. There's been several times where a bug report
was caused by an out of tree module, or a machine check exception.

That's because BPF development probably never gets hit by things that cause
taints. That doesn't go for the rest of the kernel.

Who isn't looking at the bug because of the 'taint' argument? I'm not
looking at it right now, because it isn't top of my priority list.

So is spending 5 days debugging something and then finding out that what
caused the taint *was* the culprit!

Sorry, but that has happened to me too many times. Which is why you get
grumpy kernel developers pushing back on this.

Again, I've been burned by OoO modules more than once. If you send 5 days
debugging something to find out that the cause was from an OoO module,
you'd change your tune too.

They are not as common as you think.

I talked with KP on IRC, and he said he's going to work on the same thing
as above. That is, showing what BPF programs are loaded, and if they modify
the return of any function, as well as what those functions are. And have
that reported in the oops message.

I'm not hell bent on BPF triggering a taint, as long as the oops message
explicitly defines what BPF is doing. I think that's much more informative
than a taint, and I would greatly welcome that. The main issue I'm raising
is that I want the oops message to have most the information to gather what
went wrong, and not rely on other tooling like kernel core dumps and drgn
for debugging the problem.
