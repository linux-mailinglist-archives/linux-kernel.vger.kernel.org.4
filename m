It seems possible to re-use the eventfd counter to pass the
notification value but it will require some synchronization: the
kernel's eventfd_signal() simply adds value to the eventfd internal
counter. So if two or more ACPI notifications (for a single device)
are received and propagated one by one by the host kernel, VMM could
read one coalesced value and will be unable to retrieve the
notification values. We could probably register two eventfd: one for
host kernel to VMM and the second from the VMM to host kernel: so the
second one will be used in a similar way as resample enventfd for
level triggered interrupts. Or some other serialization mechanism will
have to be applied.

IIUC the only concern with hotplug devices is how to generate the AML
code for them. If we theoretically could prepare an ACPI guest table
upfront for PCI PM even for hot pluggable devices (by providing the
kind of slot as you've described), why can't we do the same for ACPI
notifications? For both cases we have to associate such a generated
AML device object/slot with a specific PCI device anyway: at least VMM
will have to allocate some memory region for each of them upfront and
use this address during AML generation, which will allow to associate
address that guest access with real device on which we want to perform
operations: either perform PM operation or get ACPI notification
value.

It will do exactly the same thing that it would do on the host side.
Since device is pass-through to the guest and runs native driver
inside the guest, the notify handler will be registered by such driver
(e.g. via acpi_install_notify_handler). Now when a guest handles the
GPExx, it evaluates the ACPI handler for it: Method(_Exx..) [Method
(_E00, 0, NotSerialized) for GPE00, Method (_E01, 0, NotSerialized)
for GPE01 and so one]. Such a handler will call Notify()* which will
trigger the notify handler registered by the guest in the same way as
it would on the host.

VMM establishes that connection by allocating per vfio-pci device a
unique GPE and generating AML for it. Once it is done and the VMM
wants to replicate ACPI notification on specific device it just
triggers specific, associated GPExx/SCI which in consequence evaluates
guest ACPI _Exx method
        Scope (_GPE)
        {
            Method (_E00, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                Local0 =3D  \_SB.PCI0.GPP0.PEGP.NOTY
                Notify ( \_SB.PCI0.GPP0.PEGP, Local0)
            }
        }
which is generated per device.

The use case we are looking at right now, as Dominick wrote, are
D-notifier events about the GPU power available to mobile discrete
GPUs.
Natively the firmware notifies the GPU driver to dynamically adjust
the amount of power that can be used by the GPU. It does it by
utilizing ACPI notification on a PCI device object and we want to
replicate this behaviour on the guest side.

Other common use case (although not related to pci-vfio) when ACPI
notification are used is AC adapter status change: firmware can
signalize ac adapter status change and as consequence evaluates:
Notify (AC, 0x80) // Status Change
which finally triggers registered ACPI notify handler (acpi_ac_notify)
for ac adapter.

There are many different notifications value:
https://uefi.org/htmlspecs/ACPI_Spec_6_4_html/05_ACPI_Software_Programming_=
Model/ACPI_Software_Programming_Model.html#device-object-notifications
and as described in linked chapter: notification values above 0x80 are
device or hardware specific. The purpose of this patch is to replicate
such notifications to pass-through devices, so the guest device driver
can handle them in its specific ACPI notification handler way, nothing
more than that.

Thank you,
