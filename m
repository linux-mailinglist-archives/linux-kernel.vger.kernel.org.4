That defect isn't going to be fixed simply by changing how KVM forwards NMIs
though.  IIUC, _everything_ between VM-Exit and the invocation of the NMI handler
needs to be noinstr.  On VM-Exit due to NMI, NMIs are blocked.  If a #BP/#DB/#PF
occurs before KVM gets to kvm_x86_handle_exit_irqoff(), the subsequent IRET will
unblock NMIs before the original NMI is serviced, i.e. a second NMI could come in
at anytime regardless of how KVM forwards the NMI to the kernel.

Is there any way to solve this without tagging everything noinstr?  There is a
metric shit ton of code between VM-Exit and the handling of NMIs, and much of that
code is common helpers.  It might be possible to hoist NMI handler much earlier,
though we'd need to do a super thorough audit to ensure all necessary host state
is restored.

Side topic, there's a bug in the ISE docs.  Section "9.4.2 NMI Blocking" states
that bit 16 holds the "unblock NMI" magic, which I'm guessing is a holdover from
an earlier revision of FRED.

  As specified in Section 6.1.3 and Section 6.2.3, ERETS and ERETU each unblocks NMIs
  if bit 16 of the popped CS field is 1. The following items detail how this behavior may be
  changed in VMX non-root operation, depending on the settings of certain VM-execution
  controls:

Heh, well yeah, because that's how KVM used to handle NMIs back before I reworked
NMI handling to use the direct call method.  Ironically, that original change was
done in part to try and make it _easier_ to deal with FRED (back before FRED was
publicly disclosed).

If KVM reverts to INTn, the fix to route KVM=>NMI through the non-IST entry can
be reverted too.
