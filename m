QEMU does something similar but I think it can really only be described
as a hack.  In this case I think we can work with them being allocated
since that's essentially the static path.

I think we could come up with wrappers that handle all cases, for
example:

int vfio_pci_alloc_irq(struct vfio_pci_core_device *vdev,
		       unsigned int vector, int irq_type)
{
	struct pci_dev *pdev = vdev->pdev;
	struct msi_map map;
	int irq;

	if (irq_type == VFIO_PCI_INTX_IRQ_INDEX)
		return pdev->irq ?: -EINVAL;

	irq = pci_irq_vector(pdev, vector);
	if (irq > 0 || irq_type == VFIO_PCI_MSI_IRQ_INDEX ||
	    !vdev->has_dyn_msix)
		return irq;

	map = pci_msix_alloc_irq_at(pdev, vector, NULL);

	return map.index;
}

void vfio_pci_free_irq(struct vfio_pci_core_device *vdev,
		       unsigned in vector, int irq_type)
{
	struct msi_map map;
	int irq;

	if (irq_type != VFIO_PCI_INTX_MSIX_INDEX ||
	    !vdev->has_dyn_msix)
		return;

	irq = pci_irq_vector(pdev, vector);
	map = { .index = vector, .virq = irq };

	if (WARN_ON(irq < 0))
		return;

	pci_msix_free_irq(pdev, msix_map);
}

At that point, maybe we'd check whether it makes sense to embed the irq
alloc/free within the ctx alloc/free.

Yes, that's looked wrong to me all along, I think that resolves it.
