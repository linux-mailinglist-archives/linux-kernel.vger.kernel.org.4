Unfortunately that also doesn't work. The tracking algorithm then
apparently still tries to set unsupported voltages, I assume that
your suggestion will result in SRAM voltage being requested as
1310000uV (proc_max_volt) + 200000uV (max_step_size) = 1330000uV
which also isn't supported by the regulator.

[    1.972654] cpu cpu0: cpu0: failed to scale up voltage!
[    1.977951] cpufreq: __target_index: Failed to change cpu frequency: -22
[    1.984776] cpu cpu0: cpu0: failed to scale up voltage!
[    1.990039] cpufreq: __target_index: Failed to change cpu frequency: -22
...

With my initial suggestion to set both, proc_max_volt and sram_max_volt
to 1350000 it does work.

However, I think we are now botching around with work-arounds not
addressing the underlying problems which are that
 a) the tracking algorithm initially tries to raise the SRAM voltage to
    be **exactly** the minimum of proc_max_volt + max_step_size or
    sram_max_volt.
 b) requesting an exact voltage, ie. regulator_set_voltage(reg, X, X),
    is always problematic in case of regulators only supporting a
    limited set of supported voltages.

While adjusting the voltages in the SoC's platform data as a
work-around may be good enough as a hot-fix for now, imho the best
would be to re-write the tracking algorithm addressing both of the
above flaws.

I've introduced dedicated platform_data for MT7623 setting
proc_max_volt to 1300000, and yes, that does work.
However, on MT7623 there has not been any problem before as well.
