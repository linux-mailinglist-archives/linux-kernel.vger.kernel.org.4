Yes, /proc/<pid>/stat shows that kind of ratio for the qemu process.

Perf does not really show much anything in the L1, the 10% looks like it's vmx_flush_tlb_current.

Same here.

Something I just noticed by tracing hv_track_root_tdp is that the VM appears to go through
some ~10000 unique roots in the period before kernel init starts (so grub + kernel decompression).
That part seems to take a long time. Is this kind of churn of roots by design?

The ftrace output for when the root changes looks something like this, kvm goes through smm emulation
during the exit.

 qemu-system-x86-18971   [015] d.... 95922.997039: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason EXCEPTION_NMI rip 0xfd0bd info1 0x0000000000000000 info2 0x0000000000000413 intr_info 0x80000306 error_code 0x00000000
 qemu-system-x86-18971   [015] ..... 95922.997052: p_hv_track_root_tdp_0: (hv_track_root_tdp+0x0/0x70 [kvm]) si=0x18b082000
 qemu-system-x86-18971   [015] d.... 95922.997133: kvm_entry: vcpu 0, rip 0xf7d6b

There are also root changes after IO_INSTRUCTION exits. When I look at non-tdp-mmu it seems to cycle between two
roots in that phase time, and tdp-mmu allocates new ones instead.

You can see this for yourself with this script, my test machine is Ubuntu 22.10, QEMU 7.0.0, and the
a kernel from the kvm-x86/next branch.
