When I originally added this in 2007 the intel cpuid serial numbers
kerfuffle wasn't ancient history yet, i.e. see:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III#Controversy_about_privacy_issues

So we wanted to ensure that potentially identifying hw information
would not leak to unprivileged code just like that so easily, hence
restricting this was the easy way out.

We subsequently came up with the /etc/machine-id concept, i.e. a
*user* controlled ID value people can use instead. And for VMs we then
added logic so that the VM supplied UUID can be propagated into that
(under the assumption that the VM supplied UUID is under user control
anyway).

To my knowledge on ChromeOS the /etc/machine-id concept isn't much
liked either, they'd rather have *no* identifiable info available to
unpriv code instead of just user controllable ids... (i remember some
conversations with chromeos people back in the day about this.) if you
open up the DMI serial numbers like this you might not make yourself
many friends in that camp...

One might argue that there's always some identifiable hw info available
for apps to use, or that apps should run in sandboxes that make this
impossible, but that's cheap of courseâ€¦
