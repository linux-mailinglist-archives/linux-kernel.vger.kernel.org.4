After discussing this with Srikar, it happens that exposing the smt-enabled
value set a boot time (or not) in SYS FS and to update it when SMT level is
changed using ppc64_cpu will be better. This will aslo allow the energy
daemon to take this value in account.

When new CPU are added, the kernel will automatically online the right
number of threads based on that recorded SMT level.

I don't think we should keep the existing behavior, customers are confused
and some user space tools like lparstart have difficulties to handled mixed
SMT levels.

I'll submit a new series exposing the SMT level and propose a patch for
ppc64_cpu too.
