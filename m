Hi Theodore,

Thank you very much for applying this patch set!

But I thought this patch set was discarded because there was no 
"Reviewed-by".
And a few days ago, I came up with a better solution to the problem 
fixed by PATCH 1/2.
The new solution is called "ext4: fix corruption when online resizing a 
1K bigalloc fs", which
is in another patch set  ("[PATCH v3 0/3] ext4: fix some bugs in online 
resize") that fixes
some online resize problems. This patch set has been reviewed, and I 
would appreciate it if
you could revert PATCH 1/2 and apply the patch set containing the new 
solution.

Sorry for wasting your time without stating that a new solution is 
available after the old patch.

Thanks again!
