As a first working point, could we potentially restrict drivers to only
insert an overlay but not remove it ? It would be quite limited, but
as you pointed out, the multiple load/unload (or FPGA reconfiguration)
will only happen during development. Under "normal" condition, we could
expect the FPGA to be configured once during the system runtime. The
same goes for our PCI card which uses an existing SoC, we can probably
assume that it is going to be plugged once for all during the system
runtime.

This would limit the problems that might happen due to dynamic
insertion/removal of the overlay.
