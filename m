Right. So we agree that the level is not uniform throughout the provided
range. The invalidation by IPA is also used if 'pages' is odd, even on
systems with TLBIRANGE. We must assume the worst case here, in that the
TLBI by IPA invalidated a single PTE-level entry. You could wind up
over-invalidating in that case, but you'd still be correct.

I believe so. If we want to apply the range-based invalidations generally
in KVM then we will not always be dealing with a block-aligned chunk of
address.

Right, but you test above for system_supports_tlb_range(), meaning that
you'd unconditionally call __kvm_tlb_flush_vmid() below.
