Totally agree on all of your above points Qiuxu.

That won't be necessary I think.  The PCI core allocates all existing
DOE mailboxes and enumerates the supported protocols.  Drivers just
ask the PCI core for a mailbox supporting a specific protocol and
are free to use that as long as the PCI device exists.

Thomas Gleixner has returned to his patch sets for dynamic MSI-X
allocation.  We'll be able to leverage that to request an interrupt
in the PCI core for DOE before a driver is bound.  And a driver
can then get additional MSI-X vectors if needed.  Will only work
for MSI-X though, not MSI.

Thanks,

Lukas
