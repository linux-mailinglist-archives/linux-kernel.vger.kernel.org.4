Without more details about what's broken and when, I can't say.  What
I *think* is that a device that doesn't work per spec needs a quirk.
Typically it's a device that advertises a capability that doesn't work
correctly.

That doesn't *sound* really robust to me because even if the default
config after hot-add works, the user can change things via sysfs, and
any configuration we set it to should work as well.  If there are
land-mines there, we need a quirk that prevents sysfs from running
into it.
