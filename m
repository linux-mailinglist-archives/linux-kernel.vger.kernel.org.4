That's actually quite neat, I like it.  It documents clearly which
registers need protection because of concurrent RMWs and callers can't
do anything wrong.

Though I'd use a switch/case statement such that future additions
of registers that need protection are always just a clean, one-line
change.

Plus some kernel-doc or code comment to explain that certain
registers in the PCI Express Capability Structure are accessed
concurrently in a RMW fashion, hence require locking.

Since this protects specifically registers in the PCI Express
Capability, whose location is cached in struct pci_dev->pcie_cap,
I'm wondering if pcie_cap_lock is a clearer name.

PCI_EXP_SLTCTL is definitely modified from the interrupt handler
pciehp_ist(), but one could argue that hotplug interrupts don't
usually occur *that* often.  (We've had interrupt storms though
from broken devices or ones with a shared interrupt etc.)

I guess I'm just generally worried about acquiring a lock that's
not necessary.  E.g. on boot, numerous config space accesses are
performed to enumerate and initialize devices and reducing concurrency
might slow down boot times.  It's just a risk that I'd recommend
to avoid if possible.

Thanks,

Lukas
