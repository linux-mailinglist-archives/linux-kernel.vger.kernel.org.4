For native PME/hot-plug signaling there is no difference.  This is the
same interrupt by the spec after all IIRC.

For GPE-based signaling, though, there is a difference, because GPEs
can only be used directly for wake signaling (this is related to
_PRW).  In particular, the only provision in the ACPI spec for device
hot-add are the Bus Check and Device Check notification values (0 and
1) which require AML to run and evaluate Notify() on specific AML
objects.

Hence, there is no spec-defined way to tell the OS that "something can
be hot-added under this device while in D3 and you will get notified
about that".
