You're right.  Originally SG lists were used as the majority of
our input came from network packets, in the form of skb's.  They
are easily translated into SG lists.  This is still somewhat the
case for parts of the Crypto API (e.g., skcipher and ahash).

However, for akcipher the only user of the underlying API is the
file in question so I absolutely agree that forcing it to go through
an SG list is just wrong.

I'll change the underlying akcipher interface to take pointers
instead and hide the SG list stuff (along with the copying) inside
API.

In the mean time feel free to take this patch as it appears to be
correct and should keep things chugging along while we work on the
API.
