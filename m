Way before the callback is even ready to execute, you can rcuog, rcuop,
rcu_preempt threads running to go through the grace period state machine.

But all CPUs idle does not mean grace period is over, you can have a task (at
least on PREEMPT_RT) block in the middle of an RCU read-side critical section
and then all CPUs go idle.

Other than that, a typical flow could look like:

1. CPU queues a callback.
2. CPU then goes idle.
3. Another CPU is running the RCU threads waking up otherwise idle CPUs.
4. Grace period completes and an RCU thread runs a callback.

Ah, ok. Maybe what you have (like daemons) are already requesting RCU for
something. Android folks had some logger requesting RCU all the time.

Cool! I believe Len Brown can help on that , or maybe there is another way you
can read the counters to figure out the PC8% and RAPL power.
