I talked with Florent about this offline.
ftrace_test_recursion_trylock() is required for generic ftrace
use because user callback can call a function which can be
traced by ftrace. This means it can cause an infinite loop.
However, if user can ensure to check it by itself, I can add a
flag to avoid that trylock. (Of course, you can shoot your foot.)

I thought the preemption disabling was for accessing per-cpu,
but it is needed for rethook to get an object from an RCU
protected list.
Thus when we move on the per-task shadow stack, it can be
removed too.

Is rcu_read_lock() better than preempt_disable()?

Note that ftrace_test_recursion_trylock() is just a bit operation
per-task, not taking a lock (nor atomic).
