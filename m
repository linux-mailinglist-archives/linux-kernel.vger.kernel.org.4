So if I understand correclty, this implies creating a new ioctl in KVM
anyways? What would be then the difference with what I do? We are
affecting the kernel anyways.

For what is worth, also my version performs #invalidate+1 swaps, which
is not optimized.

Honestly, I don't see how the above is easier or simpler than what is
being proposed here.

Thank you,
