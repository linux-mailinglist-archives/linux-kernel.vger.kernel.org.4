I tend to agree, although some clarification would be helpful
regarding what is being fixed and why? I *think* I know, but I have
not been involved as deeply as some of the distro folks in getting
these requirements explicit.

I already implemented this for mach-virt here, so we can load Fedora
kernels without firmware:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/ff11422804cd03494cc98691eecd3909ea09ab6f

On arm64, this is probably more straight-forward, as the bare metal
image is already intended to be booted directly like that. However,
the x86 uncompressed image requires surprisingly little from all the
boot_params/setup_header cruft to actually boot, so perhaps there it
is easy too.

There is an unresolved issue related to kexec_load_file(), where only
the compressed image is signed, but the uncompressed image is what
ultimately gets booted, which either needs the decompression to occur
in the kernel, or a secondary signature that the kernel can verify
after the decompression happens in user space.

Dave and I have generated several ideas here, but there hasn't been
any progress towards a solution that seems palatable for upstream.
