I do not know how many users depend on this behavior. But I believe
that there are such users. And breaking compatibility with userspace
implementation would make more harm then good in this case.

Honestly, I dislike any sscanf() modification which have been suggested
so far:

  + %!d is not acceptable because it produces compiler errors

  + %d! is not acceptable because "use 64!" is a realistic string.
    We could not be sure that "<number>!" will never be parsed
    in kernel.

  + %d%[!] produces compiler error either. It is hard to parse by eyes.
    Also the meaning of such a format would be far from obvious.

  + %pj or another %p modifiers would be hard to understand either.

    Yes, we have %pe but I think that only few people really use it.
    And it is kind of self-explanatory because it is typically
    used together with ERR_PTR() and with variables called
    "err" or "ret".

I would really like to see the code depending on it. The cover letter
suggests that there already is a patch with such a custom parser.
I am sorry if it has already been mentioned. There were so many threads.

Sure, we do not want two full featured sscanf() implementations. But a
wrapper checking for leading whitespace and using kstrto<foo>
family does not sound too complex.

There should always be a good reason to introduce an incompatibility
between the kernel and the userspace implementation of a commonly
used API.

Petr
