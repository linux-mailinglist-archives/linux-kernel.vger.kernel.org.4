I did not fully understand the concern here. And I thought you will add 
more after your vacation. :)

This patch calls of_changeset_apply() to add new nodes to base tree. And 
inside of_changeset_apply(),

global lock of_mutex is used to protect the change.  And this function 
is also used by hotplug-cpu.c, i2c-demux-pinctrl.c, pnv_php.c.

Do you mean of_changeset_apply() is fragile and should not be used?


The scope of this patch is just create a device tree node for pci device 
and add the node to the base tree during pci enumeration.

Could you give me an example code for the race condition you are 
worrying about?


Thanks,

Lizhi
