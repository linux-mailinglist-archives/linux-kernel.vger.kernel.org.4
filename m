This one isn't sufficient for .configs which already have
PER_VMA_LOCK=y.  Using `depends on BROKEN' would be better.

We're still awaiting tester input on this?

I think a clean new fully-changelogged two-patch series would be the
best way to handle this.  Please ensure that the [0/2] intro clearly
explains what we're proposing here, and why.

Also, "might slightly regress" is a bit weak.  These things are
measurable, no?  Because a better solution would be to fix 6.4.x and
mainline and leave it at that.
