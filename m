Is this stalled?  We explored the idea of changing the PCI core so
that for devices that use ATS/PRI, we could enable PASID without
checking for ACS [1], but IIUC we ultimately concluded that it was
based on a misunderstanding of how ATS Translation Requests are routed
and that an AMD driver change would be required [2].

So it seems like we still have this regression, and we're running out
of time before v6.2.
