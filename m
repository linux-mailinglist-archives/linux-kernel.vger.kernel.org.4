Looks fine. But do we even need "bios" option? Since it is the default
value, I am not sure why we need to list that as an option again. IMO
this could be removed.

Checking the original patch which added it, it looks like the intention
is to give option to boost performance over integrity.

commit 43c16408842b0eeb367c23a6fa540ce69f99e347
Author: Andrew Patterson <andrew.patterson@hp.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 22 16:52:09 2009 -0600

    PCI: Add support for turning PCIe ECRC on or off
    
    Adds support for PCI Express transaction layer end-to-end CRC checking
    (ECRC).  This patch will enable/disable ECRC checking by setting/clearing
    the ECRC Check Enable and/or ECRC Generation Enable bits for devices that
    support ECRC.
    
    The ECRC setting is controlled by the "pci=ecrc=<policy>" command-line
    option. If this option is not set or is set to 'bios", the enable and
    generation bits are left in whatever state that firmware/BIOS set them to.
    The "off" setting turns them off, and the "on" option turns them on (if the
    device supports it).
    
    Turning ECRC on or off can be a data integrity versus performance
    tradeoff.  In theory, turning it on will catch more data errors, turning
    it off means possibly better performance since CRC does not need to be
    calculated by the PCIe hardware and packet sizes are reduced.

Agree.
