 From pci spec 4, in sec 5.5
"Ports that support L1 PM Substates must not require a reference clock 
while in L1 PM Substates
other than L1.0".
If there is no reference clk we can say there is no activity on the link.
If anything needs to be sent (such as LTR, or some messages ), the link 
needs to be back in L0 before it
sends the packet to the link partner.

To exit from L1.x clkreq pin should be asserted.

In suspend after turning off clocks and phy we can enable to trigger an 
interrupt whenever the clk req pin asserts.
In that interrupt handler, we can enable the pcie resources back.

What are your thoughts on this?
