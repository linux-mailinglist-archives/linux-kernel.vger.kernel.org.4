Hmmm. Do you want to make my life easier or want to get less mail? I
thought about this for a while. Unless you strongly object, I would like
to continue forwarding them for the following reasons:

* you might be on vacation or AFK for other reasons; your Comaintainers
that were CCed would know and likely then help out
* CCing the list makes other people notice the issue and gives them a
chance to help (Qu Wenruo replied in bugzilla shortly after I sent the
mail you quoted, which might or might not be due to my mail).
* regression tracking is hard already; it would make it a lot harder if
I'm forced to make and maintain notes how each and every maintainer
would like me to handle situations like this
* right now I need to send one mail anyway to add a regression to the
tracking

Great, thx!

Thx for your work and good to know that you are referring to it.

Ciao, Thorsten
