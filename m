For that you need to consult each vma and it's owning task(s) and that
to me sounds like something to be done in folio_check_references.
Relying on memcg to get a cpuset cgroup is really ugly and not really
100% correct. Memory controller might be disabled and then you do not
have your association anymore.

This all can get quite expensive so the primary question is, does the
existing behavior generates any real issues or is this more of an
correctness exercise? I mean it certainly is not great to demote to an
incompatible numa node but are there any reasonable configurations when
the demotion target node is explicitly excluded from memory
policy/cpuset?
