On the contrary, it needs even more precision and any extra delay adds to
loss on accuracy :-)

It does not change the governor update interval and that is a property of
the thermal zone. Correct. And that is the intention of the change.
The actual temperature updates driven by the governor will always
result in a driver call. While a userspace call will not be in the way
of the governor update.

Sysfs reads, However, with the current code as is, it may cause
jittering on the actual execution of the governor throttle function.
 causing the computation of the desired outcome cooling device being skewed.

I guess what you are really saying is: go read the hwmon sysfs node,
or, hwmon solves this for us, which unfortunately is not true for all devices.

The fact that hwmon does it in some way is another evidence of the
actual problem. Telling that this has to be solved by another subsystem
for a sysfs node that is part of thermal subsystem does not really solve
the problem. Also as I mentioned, this is not common on all hwmon
devices, and not all I2C devices are hwmon devices. In fact, I2C
was just one example of a slow device. There are more I can quote
that are not necessarily under the hwmon case.


Not sure if you missed, but an alternative for the difference of
opinion on how this should behave is to have caching for response
of sysfs read of tz/temp  as an option/configuration. Then we let
userspace to choose which behavior it wants.
