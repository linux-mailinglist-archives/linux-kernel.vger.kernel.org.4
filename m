Yah it was an interesting thought. Maybe before the switch to UPM it might've
been possible to avoid the zapping, but seems like it's a fairly general
requirement now.

It may still be possible to avoiding zapping for shared->private
conversions since the subsequent access with C-bit set would cause an
#NPF with RMP bit set, but yah, it won't work for private->shared and
doesn't seem worth it to complicate the logic for anything SNP-specific
unless it would make a significant performance impact, but I think it
would be lost in the noise vs. RMPUPDATE/initial faulting of private
pages/directmap handling/guest exits for page-state change/etc.

I mean "pre-accepting" in the sense of "guests that don't have
lazy-acceptance enabled", so yes the whole of system memory.

For SNP the OVMF bits are there:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/devel@edk2.groups.io/msg53857.html

but guest-side kernel support still requires these patches getting upstream:

  Kirill's base+TDX lazy-acceptance support:
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Y7QzI0GqNeG9OHy1@zn.tnic/T/

  Tom's follow-on SNP support:
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1670513353.git.thomas.lendacky@amd.com/

  Dionna's patch to instruct OVMF to not pre-accept remaining memory
  after EFI_EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES:
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/def9b0b5-b880-be99-fa95-b05d76a91824@intel.com/T/

But yes, I agree lazy-acceptance will probably be the common default for
TDX/SNP guests, where we'd only be zapping entries that we know the
guest is going to be using anyway, as well as avoiding all the other
related overhead.

Yah, can't think of any benefit currently. With both pre-acceptance and
lazy-acceptance those pages will get touched shorty after
KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES, so the more obvious benefit of avoiding
unecessary RMPUPDATEs doesn't end up working here. And in terms of re-using
callbacks it seems like the TDX and SNP hooks are both where it makes the
most sense to have them. Would be nice to have a shared callback for
this but might not be the right approach here.
