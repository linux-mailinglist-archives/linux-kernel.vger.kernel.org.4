I need to evaluate what Clément Léger wrote in the email you replied to.  I had overlooked this
reply to my questions.  From a quick scan, it looks like he _probably_ provided the context I
was looking for to understand the architecture of the proposal.  But it is late Sunday night,
so I won't get to this tonight.
