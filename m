That really took a while to think about it :)

We have the following cases on the PCI/MSI side:

 1) The MSI[X] entry can be masked

 2) The MSI[X] entry cannot be masked because hardware did not implement
    it, masking is globally disabled due to XEN, masking does not exist
    for this horrible virtual MSI hackery

Now you said:

 "For the GIC, I'd definitely want things masked locally."

I decoded this, that you want to have these interrupts masked at the GIC
level too independent of #1 or #2 above. And then:

 "What I'd like to get rid off is the double masking."

But relying on the GIC alone is not really a good thing IMO. There is no
point to let some confused device send unwanted MSI messages around
without a way to shut it up from the generic code via the regular
mask/unmask callbacks.

On the other hand for PCI/MSI[x] the mask/unmask operations are not in
the hot path as PCI/MSI[x] are strictly edge. Mask/unmask is only
happening on startup, shutdown and when an interrupt arrives after
disable_irq() incremented the lazy disable counter.

For regular interrupt handling mask/unmask is not involved.

So to avoid that global key we can let the parent domain set a new flag,
e.g. MSI_FLAG_PCI_MSI_MASK_PARENT, in msi_parent_ops::supported_flags
and let the PCI/MSI core code query that information when the per device
domain is created and select the appropriate template or fixup the
callbacks after the domain is created.

Does that address your concerns?

Thanks,
