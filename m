And sanity check CPUID.0xB output even when x2APIC is supported, e.g. require
CPUID.0xB.EBX to be non-zero.  Odds are very good that there are VMs in the wild
that support x2APIC but have an empty CPUID.0xB due to it being a topology leaf,
i.e. may be suppressed when vCPUs aren't pinned.  QEMU even has a knob to deliberately
disable CPUID.0xB, e.g. booting a VM with

 cpu host,host-phys-bits,-cpuid-0xb,+x2apic

works just fine.

I agree with David that checking boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_X2APIC) is preferred,
x2APIC goes unused on a lot of platforms due to the kernel's interrupt remapping
requirement.  I would rather have a single explicit "no_parallel_bringup" option
than try to infer the user's intentions based on tangentially related params.

I don't think using 0x1F will buy us anything except complexity.  0x1F provides more
details on the topology, but its x2APIC ID enumeration isn't any more trustworthy
than 0xB.

The only thing I can see benefiting from parallel bringup without x2APIC is large
VMs running on pre-x2AVIC hardware.  E.g. IIRC, we (Google) hide x2APIC on AMD-based
VMs so that VMs would take advantage of AVIC acceleration if AVIC were even to be
enabled.

But that's more of an argument for "try to use CPUID.0x1" than it is an argument
for trying to use CPUID.0xB without x2APIC.
