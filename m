[ adding linux-toolchains ]

I don't think ensuring reliability is an easy task, regardless of the
complexity of the unwinding format.

Whether it's SFrame or DWARF/eh_frame, the question would be how to
ensure it's always reliable for a compiler "power user" like the kernel
which has many edge cases (including lots of inline asm which the
compiler has no visibility to) and which uses unwinding for more than
just debugging.

It would need some kind of black-box testing on a complex code base.
(hint: kind of like what objtool already does today)
