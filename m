Right, as you can see by my comment on that patch, not including the btf
id is a tad confusing, so yeah, better include that.

Well, I disagree. Working out these issues with bpffs is an important
aspect to get a consistent API, and handwaving it away risks merging
something that will turn out to not be workable further down the line at
which point we can't change it.
