To be precise the VMM doesn't listen to all netlink events: it listens
only to "acpi_event" family and acpi related multicast group, which
means it listens to all events generated through
acpi_bus_generate_netlink_event.

Before sending this patch I thought about using eventfd instead
netalink which will actually provide a channel associated with a given
device and therefore such notifications will be received only by the
VMM associated with such a device. Nevertheless, it seems like eventfd
will allow to signalize events happening (notify on a given device)
but is not capable of sending any payload so in our case there is no
room for propagating notification value via eventfd. Maybe there is
other mechanism eventfd-like which will allow to achieve above?

If there is no such mechanism, maybe instead of using existing acpi
netlink events, which are associated with "acpi_event" netlink family
and acpi multicast group, we could create per vfio-pci a different
netlink family or probably reuse "acpi_event" family but use different
multicast group, so each device will have dedicated netlink family.
Does it seem reasonable?

Yes, in the example VMM implementation we have mapping between the
host pci device address and guest pci device. Therefore VMM knows,
based on device name (BDF) sent via netlink, to which guest device
this notification should be propagated. The boilerplate AML is added
to each vfio-pci device which belongs to VMM and each vfio-pci device
has associated pre-allocated GPE so the VMM knows which GPE should be
triggered to replicate notification for a given device. BTW this is
only current WIP VMM implementation - this could probably be optimized
if needed.

Handling hotplug devices is more problematic. I see that the kernel
provides some runtime ACPI patching mechanism:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/firmware-guide/acpi/method-customizi=
ng.html
(which I never tried) but not even sure how VMM could take advantage
of it. BTW this realized me that the same problem with hotplug applies
to other vfio-pci use-cases e.g. runtime PM, which relies on guest
virtual ACPI method:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pm/patch/20220829114850.4341-5-a=
bhsahu@nvidia.com/.
Generating virtual ACPI content for hotplug devices seems like a more
generic issue.

The simple stub of GPE block will work to replicate the ACPI
notification only: as mentioned earlier GPE handler will be generated
per-vfio device so in your example if let assume that only:
- \_SB.PCI0.GPP0.PEGP
- \_SB.PCI0.GP17.XHC1
will be pass-through to the guest, the generated AML code for VM will
look more-less like below:

        Scope (_GPE)
        {
            Method (_E00, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                Local0 =3D  \_SB.PCI0.GPP0.PEGP.NOTY
                Notify ( \_SB.PCI0.GPP0.PEGP, Local0)
            }
        }
        Scope (_GPE)
        {
            Method (_E01, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                Local0 =3D\_SB.PCI0.GP17.XHC1.NOTY
                Notify (\_SB.PCI0.GP17.XHC1, Local0)
            }
        }

So each pass-through device will have associated GPE (0 for
\_SB.PCI0.GPP0.PEGP and 1 for \_SB.PCI0.GP17.XHC1). The path in Notify
could actually be different and related to guest pci hierarchy (but
associated to those host devices). Please also note that in this case
we use GPE in order to "inform" guest about notification coming and we
do not try to replicate host GPE scope description.

Above we assumed that other devices (like \_SB.PCI0.GPP0/1) are not
pass-through to the guest and notification are handled in host as
usual (they are not binded to pci-vfio) and there is no need to
generate AML code, allocate GPE for them and so on.

Thank you,
Grzegorz
