Hello Johannes, thanks for taking a look!

I can certainly add the "nodes=" arg to memory.reclaim and you're
right, that would help in bridging the gap. However, if I understand
the underlying code correctly, with only the nodes= arg the kernel
will indeed attempt demotion first, but the kernel will also merrily
fall back to reclaiming if it can't demote the full amount. I had
hoped to have the flexibility to protect latency sensitive jobs from
reclaim entirely while attempting to do demotion.

There are probably ways to get around that in the userspace. I presume
the userspace can check if there is available memory on the node's
demotion targets, and if so, the kernel should demote-only. But I feel
that wouldn't be reliable as the demotion logic may change across
kernel versions. The userspace may think the kernel would demote but
instead demotion failed due to whatever heuristic introduced into the
new kernel version.

The above is just one angle of the issue. Another angle (which Yosry
would care most about I think) is that at Google we call
memory.reclaim mainly when memory.current is too close to memory.max
and we expect the memory usage of the cgroup to drop as a result of a
success memory.reclaim call. I suspect once we take in commit
3f1509c57b1b ("Revert "mm/vmscan: never demote for memcg reclaim""),
we would run into that regression, but I defer to Yosry here, he may
have a solution for that in mind already.

For these reasons, what do you think about adding both the "nodes="
and "demote=" args from my patch series to memory.reclaim? With these
args the default memory.reclaim behavior would suit meta as-is (no
change) but we would be able to configure it to address our use cases
as well.

As always, thanks for taking the time to review!
