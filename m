This series comprises two related fixes:

- the FILL_RETURN_BUFFER macro in -next needs to access percpu data,
  hence the GS segment base needs to be loaded before FILL_RETURN_BUFFER.
  This means moving guest vmload/vmsave and host vmload to assembly
  (patches 8 and 9).

- because AMD wants the OS to set STIBP to 1 before executing the
  return thunk (un)training sequence, IA32_SPEC_CTRL must be restored
  before UNTRAIN_RET, too.  This must also be moved to assembly and,
  for consistency, the guest SPEC_CTRL is also loaded in there
  (patch 10).

Neither is particularly hard, however because of 32-bit systems one needs
to keep the number of arguments to __svm_vcpu_run to three or fewer.
Therefore, patches 2 to 7 move various accesses to the vcpu_svm struct
and to percpu data to vmenter.S, cleaning up various bits along the way
to keep the assembly code nice.  I think the code is simpler than before
after these prerequisites, and even at the end of the series it is not
much harder to follow despite doing a lot more stuff.  Care has been
taken to keep the "normal" and SEV-ES code as similar as possible,
even though the latter would not hit the three argument barrier; even
the prototype is the same.

The above summary leaves patch 1, which introduces a separate asm-offsets.c
file for KVM, so that kernel/asm-offsets.c does not have to do ugly includes
with ../ paths; and patch 11, which is just more dead code removal.

Thanks,

Paolo

v2->v3: store SME-adjusted save_area physical address in svm_cpu_data,
	access it with PER_CPU_VAR instead of an argument [Sean, sort of]

	split out-of-line spec-ctrl restore macro in two parts [Sean]

	adjust comments to point out clobbered registers [Sean]
