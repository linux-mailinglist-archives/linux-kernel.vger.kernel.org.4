For J7200 SoC which doesn't have the link retraining quirk set, I added prints
before and after the exact section of newly added code with this patch. The
output with timestamps for the case where no EP is connected to the board is:
[    1.350061] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> Before link training check
[    1.356324] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: Link training complete
[    1.361883] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> After link training check
indicating a latency of about 12 milliseconds.

On the other hand, with an EP device connected, the output is:
[    1.349822] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> Before link training check
[    1.356083] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: Link training complete
[    1.361641] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> After link training check
again indicating a latency of about 12 milliseconds.

For the J721e SoC which has the quirk, without an EP device connected, the
output is:
[    2.668926] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> Before link training check
[    2.675178] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: Link training complete
[    2.680734] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> After link training check
with the latency again being about 12 milliseconds.

Now, with the EP device connected to the board with J721e SoC, the output for
the training phase is:
[    2.685335] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> Before link training check
[    2.691592] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: Link training complete
[    2.697150] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> After link training check
and for the retraining phase is:
[    2.807581] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> Before link training check
[    2.831578] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: LINK DOWN!
[    2.831905] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: Link training complete
[    2.841653] j721e-pcie 2910000.pcie: <1> After link training check
During the training phase, the latency again is about 12 milliseconds, while
during the retraining phase, the latency is about 34 milliseconds.

Note, the above latency is measured for the Non-RT Linux kernel, with the
assumption that the latency will be lower for the RT Linux kernel.

I suppose this indicates a latency of about 12 milliseconds for the PCIe
controllers without the Gen2 Link Retraining quirk, while for the PCIe
controller with the Gen2 Link Retraining quirk, it is a net latency of 12+34
milliseconds = 46 milliseconds for the training and retraining phases.
