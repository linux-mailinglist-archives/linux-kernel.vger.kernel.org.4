That's what GPIO_REGMAP_ADDR(addr) is for :)

I can't follow you here exactly. But I've briefly looked at the 
datasheet
and the output is an open drain one. Just like the one we are currently
discussing in [1]. Here too, there seems to be no direction register,
although it is mentioned in the datasheet. But Table 1. Register Address 
Map
is super confusing, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

Since we now have already two different chips with this OD output and 
always
active input buffer, it makes sense to add support to gpio-regmap for 
these
kind of devices. To me it is still unclear wether we need the direction 
at
all. Linus answered my question yesterday, but I haven't found time to 
dig
into that topic myself. Please go ahead and make some suggestions :)
