The patch contains "#ifdef CONFIG_LOONGARCH", which makes this
solution LoongArch-specific.  I'm not willing for that yet.

It sounds like the LoongArch MSI limit is known at compile-time, or at
least at boot-time, so the kernel ought to be able to figure out what
to do without a command-line parameter.

I guess you mean msi_domain_ops::domain_alloc_irqs() (not
msi_domain_info).  If this is really a generic problem, I'm surprised
that no other arch has needed to override .domain_alloc_irqs().

I think you'll have better luck getting feedback if you can post the
complete working patch.  At the very least, you'll learn more about
the problem by doing that.
