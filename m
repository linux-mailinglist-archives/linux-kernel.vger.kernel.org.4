"Guests like Linux," or just Linux? What do you mean by "tend"? When
do they perform this check, and when do they not?

.

I would argue that regardless of the number of counters emulated, a
guest PMU agent may assume that the 4 legacy counters are present,
since that's what the APM specifies.

Which specific guest operating systems is this change intended for?

Which AMD platforms have less than 4 counters available?

Does this actually guarantee that the requisite number of counters are
available and will always be available while the guest is running?
What happens if some other client of the host perf subsystem requests
a CPU-pinned counter after this checck?
