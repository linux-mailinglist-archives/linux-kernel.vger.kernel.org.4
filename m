Oh, I actually didn't expect a message based mechanism for statistics
reading, which is overcomplicated for a test.

Maybe just pass a structured data buffer via platform_data, so that both
fpga-test & fake drivers could recognize and access it directly. fpga-test
could directly check the updated statistics after reprograming and assert
them. Is that OK for you?

Thanks,
