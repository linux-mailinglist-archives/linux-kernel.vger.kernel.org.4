How sure are you of this statement?  Of all the Laptops I have with
TPM2 (a sample size of 2), my old Dell XPS-13 (a 9350 bought in 2016
with a TPM 1.2 that was firmware upgraded to 2.0) has a Nuvoton TIS TPM
that doesn't respond on any locality other than 0.  However, my more
modern Inspiron 13 2-in-1 (a 7391 from 2019 recently bought
refurbished) has an Intel PTT TPM using the CRB interface and responds
fine on locality 1 and also indicates that locality in the creation
data.  Neither of these laptops has TXT nor the SMX extensions, so that
would seem to indicate your statement above isn't universal.
