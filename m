If we try to add inode_lock to ext4_writepages to complete the
conversion, there may be a deadlock as follows:

       CPU0             CPU1
writeback_single_inode
  spin_lock(&inode->i_lock) ---> LOCK B
                    enable_verity
                     inode_lock(inode)  ---> LOCK A
                     vops->begin_enable_verity
                     ext4_begin_enable_verity
                      ext4_inode_attach_jinode
                       spin_lock(&inode->i_lock)   ---> try LOCK B
  __writeback_single_inode          |
   do_writepages                ABBA deadlock
    ext4_writepages                 |
     inode_lock(inode)  ---> try LOCK A

If we add inode_lock to the write back process to complete the inline 
conversion,
it seems that we still have to add an ops ...

I've been going over this problem for a long time, but I can't think of 
a good way
to solve it.
