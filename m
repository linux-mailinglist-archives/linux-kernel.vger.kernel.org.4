Just to be precise: shim isn't a boot loader.  It's a trust pivot
device away from the built in UEFI keys to the Machine Owner Keys. 
Shim is designed to be used with another bootloader like grub or sd-
boot.  Now you could load a kernel directly with shim, in the same way
you could load it directly from UEFI, but that doesn't make it a
bootloader.

Yes, rather than try to have all bootloaders conform to the MoK
protocol, it's easier to implement it in a single purpose component
that can be used with any of them.  Essentially if you want to rely on
the UEFI keys and not do an MoK pivot (as some people do) then you can
remove shim from the sequence.

In many ways that's part of the problem with this patch set: The
underlying assumption is everyone does this trust pivot.  If you don't
do this trust pivot (I don't for instance, having replaced my UEFI keys
with my own) you can't add keys to the kernel this way.  However, how
would the kernel know whether you trust the UEFI keys or not?  The
other problem is that without the shim protocol being present, grub
can't check the kernel signature, which means that even if you do own
your own UEFI keys, you need something to replace shim, like:
