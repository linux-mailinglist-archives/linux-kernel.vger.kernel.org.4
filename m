Just add some notes and thoughts. There is a rcupdate.rcu_expedited=1
parameter that can be used during the boot. For example on our devices
to speedup a boot we boot the kernel with rcu_expedited:

XQ-DQ54:/ # cat /proc/cmdline
stack_depot_disable=on kasan.stacktrace=off kvm-arm.mode=protected cgroup_disable=pressure console=ttyMSM0,115200n8 loglevel=6 kpti=0 log_buf_len=256K kernel.panic_on_rcu_stall=1 service_locator.enable=1 msm_rtb.filter=0x237 rcupdate.rcu_expedited=1 rcu_nocbs=0-7 ftrace_dump_on_oops swiotlb=noforce loop.max_part=7 fw_devlink.strict=1 allow_mismatched_32bit_el0 cpufreq.default_governor=performance printk.console_no_auto_verbose=1 kasan=off sysctl.kernel.sched_pelt_multiplier=4 can.stats_timer=0 pcie_ports=compat irqaffinity=0-2 disable_dma32=on no-steal-acc cgroup.memory=nokmem,nosocket video=vfb:640x400,bpp=32,memsize=3072000 page_owner=on stack_depot_disable=off printk.console_no_auto_verbose=0 nosoftlockup bootconfig buildvariant=userdebug  msm_drm.dsi_display0=somc,1_panel: rootwait ro init=/init  qcom_geni_serial.con_enabled=0 oembootloader.startup=0x00000001 oembootloader.warmboot=0x00000000 oembootloader.securityflags=0x00000001
XQ-DQ54:/ #

then a user space can decides if it is needed or not:

<snip>
rcu_expedited  rcu_normal
XQ-DQ54:/ # ls -al /sys/kernel/rcu_*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 2023-02-16 09:27 /sys/kernel/rcu_expedited
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 2023-02-16 09:27 /sys/kernel/rcu_normal
XQ-DQ54:/ #
<snip>

for lazy we can add "rcu_cb_lazy" parameter and boot the kernel with
true or false. So we can follow and be aligned with rcu_expedited and
rcu_normal parameters.
