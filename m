Hi, I was stuck in some urgent work recently and I will do this ASAP and
it should be done in this week.

The Kunit tests thing sounds interesting and I would like to this. But
I still need some time to get basic knowledge then I maybe able to discuss
detais. Of couse, anyone is also interesting in this and can make this work
soon is fine.:)

Yes, I can't agree more and this may be able to find other exsiting bugs.
