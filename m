My understanding is there is no way to check for the DL_Active state
on these devices. Which is why pcie_wait_for_link_delay uses a fixed
delay in that case.

I think it still makes sense for pcie_retrain_link to wait for the
Link Training bit, since it is typical for the retraining to never go
to a LTSSM state where the LinkUp is 0 (e.g. Recovery ->
Configuration), thus the Data Link Layer will stay in DL_Active. But
it is still important to wait for the link training to complete in
that case, but also because the training may not cause the Data Link
state to change immediately.

However since DLLLA reporting is optional, it is probably ideal if the
pcie_retrain_link only calls pcie_wait_for_link if reporting is
available? This would avoid the fixed delay of 1s upon link retraining
for devices without reporting, which is unnecessary in the majority of
cases.

Nathan
