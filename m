It sounds like both options turn off the clocks and PHY.  But
apparently they do not look the same to the NVMe endpoint?  I guess
NVMe is in D3cold for 1), but it's in D0 for 2), right?

The PCIe spec clearly envisions Refclk being turned off
(sec 5.5.3.3.1) and PHYs being powered off (sec 5.5.3.2) while in
L1.2.

I've been assuming L1.2 exit (which includes Refclk being turned on
and PHYs being powered up) is completely handled by hardware, but it
sounds like the Qcom controller needs software assistance which fields
an interrupt when CLKREQ# is asserted and turns on Refclk and the
PHYs?

5.5.3 does say "All Link and PHY state must be maintained during L1.2,
or must be restored upon exit using implementation specific means",
and maybe Qcom counts as using implementation specific means.

I *am* concerned about whether software can do the L1.2 exit fast
enough, but the biggest reason I'm struggling with this is because
using the syscore framework to work around IRQ affinity changes that
happen late in suspend just seems kind of kludgy and it doesn't seem
like it fits cleanly in the power management model.
