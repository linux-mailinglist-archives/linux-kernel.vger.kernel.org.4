Very simple:

read from a kernel-opened fd, write to another kernel-opened fd, close
the fds and exit.

With the seccomp strict profile, a process cannot call any other system
call, and it gets killed if it does.

I tried to write a BPF filter, to see how far I can go, and that seems
sufficient to constrain what the UMD process can do.

Please note that the UMD process setup is done by the kernel, before
any user space code has the chance to run. The kernel is responsible to
properly establish the communication with the UMD process.

> 2: Constrain what the system at large can do to the UMD process.

If someone outside can influence the behavior of the UMD process,
meaning altering the result, that would be unacceptable.

I found that denying ptrace on the UMD process as target, more or less
covers everything, even trying to read or write /proc/<pid>/fd/<N>.

There might be something more subtle, like what Iann pointed out, avoid
swapping of the UMD process, as there is no integrity check when the
page comes back.

Other than that, I was limiting the kill, maybe we have to do something
similar with io_uring (but we would know if the UMD process uses it).
With that in place, the UMD process seems pretty much isolated.

I would definitely not complicate things more than that, seems that
this problem is already difficult enough to solve.

Since the goal is very specific, I think writing a very small LSM would
make sense. With SELinux or Smack, you could also do it, but you have
to care about loading a policy, enforcing, etc..

The main question is if the kernel is able to enforce isolation on the
UMD process as it would do for itself.

I'm not considering confidentiality for now, just integrity. And with
the most simple case of the UMD process only communicating with the
kernel (sufficient for my use cases).

That means no communication.
