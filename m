Guests will have nothing to lose, except gaining vPMI accuracy under this proposal.

When a host gets an overflow interrupt caused by a VMRUN, it forwards it to KVM.
KVM does not inject it into the VM, but discards it. For those using PMU to 
profiling
the hypervisor itself, they lose an interrupt or a sample on VMRUN context.

VMRUN is only counted on a CPL0-target (branch) instruction counter. The VMRUN
is not expected to be counted by the guest counters, regardless of the guest CPL.

This issue makes a guest CPL0-target instruction counter inexplicably increase, 
as if it
would have been under-counted before the virtualization instructions were counted.

Treating the host hypervisor instructions like VMRUN as guest workload instructions
is already an error in itself not "normal" behavior that affects guest accuracy.
