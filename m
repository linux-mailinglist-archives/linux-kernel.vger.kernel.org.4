After discussion in [1] I have realized that I haven't really thought
through all the consequences of this patch and therefore I am retracting
my ack here. I am not nacking the patch at this statge but I also think
this shouldn't be merged now and we should really consider all the
consequences.

Let me summarize my main concerns here as well. The proposed
implementation doesn't apply the provided nodemask to the whole reclaim
process. This means that demotion can happen outside of the mask so the
the user request cannot really control demotion targets and that limits
the interface should there be any need for a finer grained control in
the future (see an example in [2]).
Another problem is that this can limit future reclaim extensions because
of existing assumptions of the interface [3] - specify only top-tier
node to force the aging without actually reclaiming any charges and
(ab)use the interface only for aging on multi-tier system. A change to
the reclaim to not demote in some cases could break this usecase.

My counter proposal would be to define the nodemask for memory.reclaim
as a domain to constrain the charge reclaim. That means both aging and
reclaim including demotion which is a part of aging. This will allow
to control where to demote for balancing purposes (e.g. demote to node 2
rather than 3) which is impossible with the proposed scheme.
