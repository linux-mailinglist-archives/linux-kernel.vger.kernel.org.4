We need to ensure that multiple processes can use the same event name:
Example we have shared libraries that processes use to publish events.

We need to ensure that if the original FD closes and other processes/FDs
are using it, those don't get ripped out from underneath it:
Example we have perf attached and then the process exits.

I think we can accomodate that all neatly if we just make the event
self-delete upon the last ref-count decrement. That way no one needs
the delete IOCTL and we can prevent things piling up.

We have flags in the struct, so we could either make this optional or
default. I like this approach Steven.
