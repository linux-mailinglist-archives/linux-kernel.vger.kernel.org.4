For MMIO sure, we can use Svpbmt or an RSW bit in the VS-stage PTE.
Performance-wise the difference is a few fetches from guest memory by
the TSM vs a lookup by the TSM in an internal data-structure.

It's a little more complicated for shared <-> private conversion,
though. If we were to emulate what TDX does with separate Shared vs
Secure EPTs, we could use the MSB of the GPA to divide GPA space in
half between private vs shared. But then we need to enable the host to
reclaim the private pages on a private -> shared conversion: either
the TSM must track which parts of GPA space have been converted (which
gets complicated in the presence of hugepages), or we let the host
remove whatever private pages it wants. For the latter we'd then need
an "accept" flow -- we don't have a #VE equivalent on RISC-V, but I
suppose we could use access fault exceptions for this purpose.
