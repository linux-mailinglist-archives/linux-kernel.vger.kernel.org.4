I have 2 comments.

1) Besides the IBRS, STIBP & SSBD bits, the SPEC_CTRL MSR may have the 
RRSBA_DIS_S bit set in the future. I am not aware of any current Intel 
processors having this capability yet, but a future Intel processor may 
have this and the above patch will have to be modified accordingly. It 
looks like that the RRSBA_DIS_S bit will be set once.

2) AMD has their own AutoIBRS capability in Genoa which is similar to 
eIBRS but is not identified by the ARCH_CAP_IBRS_ALL bit. Instead it is 
identified by the AUTOIBRS bit in MSR_EFER. Are you planning to support 
that?

Cheers,
Longman
