Yeah, but it's that way mainly because of your earlier comments. :-)

I tried to make it more "generic" to the extent possible because of your 
concern related to genericness and I therefore intentionally put the Intel 
specific numbers into the other change.

Previously you were against saying it clearly that it's Intel FPGA 
specific when Matthew proposed changing the name to not sound something 
too generic. If you're ok with that now, I'm happy to make such change.

What I tried to say the users are not expected to be nicely confined into 
drivers/mfd/ (and a single driver in there).

You didn't answer at all my question about where to place the code?
I'm repeating it with the context below since you cut it off:


That's probably because it sounds to me you're trying to extend its 
genericness beyond the domain where it's generic. That is, you're looking 
for genericness outside of IPs (that have their own driver each) in Intel 
FPGA domain.

Whether that is "generic" enough to reside in drivers/base/regmap can
of course be debated but lets say I put it into drivers/mfd/ along with 
the code currently using it. By doing that, we'll postpone this discussion 
to the point when the first driver using it outside of drivers/mfd/ comes 
by. At that point, having the indirect code in drivers/mfd/ is shown to 
be a wrong choice.

It's of course nothing that couldn't be fixed by patches moving the code 
around to some more preferred location. And that location likely turns out 
to be drivers/base/regmap, no? Or do you have a better place for it in 
that case?
