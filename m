I must be missing something, it was described correctly earlier that
QEMU will disable MSI-X and re-enable with a new vector count.  Not
only does QEMU not really have a way to fail this change, pretty much
nothing would work if we did.

What happens in this case is that the QEMU vfio-pci driver gets a
vector_use callback for one of these new vectors {5,6,7},
vfio_msix_vector_do_use() checks that's greater than we have enabled,
disables MSI-X, and re-enables it for the new vector count.  Worst case
we'll do that 3 times if the vectors are presented in ascending order.

As above, QEMU doesn't currently return an error here, nor is there
actually any means to return an error.  MSI-X is not paravirtualized
and the PCI spec definition of MSI-X does not define that a driver
needs to check whether the device accepted unmasking a vector.  All we
can do in QEMU if the host fails to configure the device as directed is
print an error message as a breadcrumb to help debug why the device
stopped working.  In practice, I don't think I've ever seen this.

So really the difference should be transparent to the guest.  The risk
of an error allocating vectors on the host is the same, the only
significant difference should be the amount of disruption at the device
that we can better approximate the request of the guest.

Based on above, there really can never be an error if we expect the
device to work, so I think there's a misread of the current status.
Dynamic MSI-X support should simply reduce the disruption and chance of
lost interrupts at the device, but the points where we risk that the
host cannot provide the configuration we need are the same.  Thanks,

Alex
