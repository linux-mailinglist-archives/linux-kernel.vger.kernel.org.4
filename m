That means most if not all BIOS are defected.
BIOS vendors and ODM never bothered (and probably will not) to change
the capabilities advertised by config space because "it already works
under Windows".

Totally agree. I was not suggesting to limiting the setting at all.
A boot-time parameter to flip ASPM setting is very useful. If none has
been set, default to BIOS setting.

Desktop can have very different PCIe cards in the slots so BIOS date
isn't a good indicator for ASPM support.
Let alone BIOS date changes on each BIOS upgrade, this means potential
regression risk.

I'll leave this one to Intel folks.

Agree. Right now the issue is only observed when I225 is in a TBT dock.
