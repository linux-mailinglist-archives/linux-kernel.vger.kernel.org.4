Hello,
Could someone from the dmaengine maintainers please give this patch an 
attention? Despite several resends it remains unnoticed for two months 
and besides the fact, that its authors would like to have it included it 
also blocks the inclusion of our mgb4 v4l2 driver that is based on XDMA. 
The driver works fine with our HW, the API is quiet standard and 
sufficient for third-party PCIe cards based on XDMA and there are IMHO 
no unresolved objections against the code. Thanks for any help

Martin TÅ¯ma
