"pci" is not a valid compatible string.

This is not a PCI device, so it shouldn't be using PCI addressing.
'ranges' needs an entry (for each BAR) to translate to just a normal
MMIO bus with 1 or 2 address/size cells. Maybe we want a 'simple-bus'
node for each BAR. The FPGA series needs the same things, but that
aspect hasn't really been addressed as the first issue is populating
the PCI devices dynamically.

The DT address translation code should support all this
(MMIO->PCI->MMIO), but I don't think there's any existing examples. An
example (that I can test) would be great. If the unittest had that
example, I'd be thrilled.
