FWIW, given that the aim here seems to be to expose all kernel internals to be
overridden arbitrarily, I'm also concerned that there's a huge surface area for
issues with maintainability, robustness/correctness, and security.

I really don't want to be stuck in a position where someone argues that all
kernel internal functions are ABI and need to stay around as-is to be hooked by
eBPF, and I hope that we all agree that there are no guarantees on that front.

Thanks,
Mark.
