Right, in general the IOMMU driver cannot be held responsible for 
whatever might happen upstream of the IOMMU input. The DMA layer carves 
PCI windows out of its IOVA space unconditionally because we know that 
they *might* be problematic, and we don't have any specific constraints 
on our IOVA layout so it's no big deal to just sacrifice some space for 
simplicity. We don't want to have to go digging any further into 
bus-specific code to reason about whether the right ACS capabilities are 
present and enabled everywhere to prevent direct P2P or not. Other 
use-cases may have different requirements, though, so it's up to them 
what they want to do.

It's conceptually pretty much the same as the case where the device (or 
indeed a PCI host bridge or other interconnect segment in-between) has a 
constrained DMA address width - the device may not be able to access all 
of the address space that the IOMMU provides, but the IOMMU itself can't 
tell you that.

Thanks,
Robin.
