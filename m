The discussion has come to some conclusion in the framework of another
series:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20221007224515.sseyabdfa2phcsdz@mobilestation/
It includes solutions for several problems raised by @Robin Murphy.
Seeing no objection from @Robin received and the solutions were mainly
suggested by @Robin himself I'll implement them in the next series
re-spin. So to speak don't worry. The series isn't stuck. I'll
resubmit it for review on this week.
