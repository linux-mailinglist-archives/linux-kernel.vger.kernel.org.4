Is there an erratum we can read?  If this is needed to work around a
hardware defect, there should be a comment in the code to that effect,
and we should have a better understanding because there may be other
scenarios (suspend/resume, hotplug, etc) that need similar changes.

(I know this patch is to work around a suspend/resume issue, but the
change is in the AER error recovery path, so it doesn't quite fit
together for me yet.)

Are you saying the NIC sends PTM requests when it doesn't have PTM
Enable set?

What exactly does it mean for "SW to take ownership of the device"?
What PCIe transaction would tell the device the SW has taken
ownership?

So far this feels kind of hand-wavey.
