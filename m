Yes, that is what the new function comment says it should do, and the
only caller is:

drivers/iommu/iommu-sva.c:      ret = iommu_sva_alloc_pasid(mm, 1, max_pasids - 1);

Which looks inclusive also

Should be deleted

I think the whole thing was originally a micro-optimization to remove
this if statement from some mm paths..

It is closer to the intent, I think

We've had this longstanding confusion in the iommu layer that SVA and
PASID are one and the same thing, we are slowly reorganizing it.. For
now it is fine for IOMMU_SVA to cover the PASID allocator as the only
drivers that support PASID also support SVA.

Arguably the design is backwards and IOMMU_SVA should be user
selectable and it should turn off the SVA code entirely including the
driver code.

I didn't notice anything wrong, I'm sure Lu and Yi will test it!
