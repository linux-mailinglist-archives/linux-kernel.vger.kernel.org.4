You're clearing the DPC trigger status upon a PDC event, yet are saying
here the purpose is to reset port state for a future hotplugged device.

A PDC event may be synthesized, e.g. to trigger slot bringup via
sysfs, so using a PDC event to clear DPC trigger status feels wrong.
pciehp_unconfigure_device() seems like a more appropriate place to me.

That Implementation Note contains a lot of text and a fairly complex
flow chart. If you could point to specific paragraphs or numbers in
the Implementation Note that would make life easier for a reviewer
to make the connection between your code and the spec.

I was about to ask why the code is added to dpc.c, not edr.c,
and why it's not constrained to CONFIG_PCIE_EDR, but I assume
that's the reason?  Because it "might" happen for OS-native DPC
as well?

This may run concurrently to dpc_reset_link(), so I'd expect that
you need some kind of serialization.  What happens if pciehp clears
trigger status behind the DPC driver's back while it is handling an
error?

Thanks,
