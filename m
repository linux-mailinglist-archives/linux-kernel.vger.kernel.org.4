Sorry, which knobs are you talking about? I actually don't see any user knobs
in mm/memcontrol.c which are using WRITE_ONCE(). I see some of them using
xchg(), but it's a different thing.

Because nobody saw any issues with the current code?

And again if it's something that makes any automated verifiers/tooling unhappy,
I'm totally fine for fixing it, just let make it clear (and also fix the commit
title, which is not true).

Thanks!
