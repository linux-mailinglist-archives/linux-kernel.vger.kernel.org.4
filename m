Note that I can't get a distro to boot on this system from the HDD for 
the same timeout problem (so no tools easily available).

I think that it gets frozen when the internal command for read log ext 
times out. More below about that timeout.

Yeah, it just looks to be the longstanding issue of using this card on 
my arm64 machine - that is that I get IO timeouts quite regularly. I 
should have mentioned that yesterday. This just seems to be a driver issue.

Interestingly this read log ext always seems to timeout, so maybe I 
could see if there is anything specific about this command which could 
give a clue to the underlying issue. But I have spent much time trying 
to debug this issue, so not too motivated any more if Iâ€™m completely 
honest ...

Thanks,
John
