Yes, no significant changes. Just fix typo.

I also would like to add support for other DRM drivers.

But I think this deserve another patch.

Since I'm a graphic driver developer, I'm using drm-tip.

I just have already pulled, it still apply cleanly on drm-tip.

No change between v6 and v7,

it seems that it is because the mailbox don't allow me to sending too 
many mails a day.

so some of the patch is failed to delivery because out of quota.

I'm wondering

Would you will merge all of the patches in this series (e.g. including 
the patch for drm/amdgpu(7/8) and drm/radeon(8/8)) ?

Or just part of them?

Emm, I don't know because my patch seems across different subsystem of 
Linux kernel.

There is also a developer for AMDGPU (Mario) give me a R-B for the 
patch-0002 of this series.

So, at least, PATCH-0001, PATCH-0002, PATCH-0003, PATCH-0004, PATCH-0006 
are already OK(got reviewed by).

Those 5 patch are already qualified to be merged, I think.

I means that if you could merge those 5 patch first, then there no need 
to send another version again.

I will refine the rest patch with more details and description.

I'm fear of making too much noise.
