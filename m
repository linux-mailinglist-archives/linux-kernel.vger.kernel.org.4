I asked the same question when I was last accessed to hyprid core and
was told that it wouldn't happen on pmu capabilities since different pmu
events on different cpu type imply micro-architectural differences between
big and little cores,  and even the harmonization of event coding is difficult
to achieve in the short term.

I would have expected w/ current code base, vpmu (excluding pebs and lbr, intel_pt)
to continue to work on any type of pCPU until you decide to disable them completely.

Moreover, the caller of perf_get_x86_pmu_capability() may be more than just KVM,
it may be technically ebpf helpers. The diff on comments from v1 can be applied to
this version (restrict KVM semantics), and it makes the status quo clearer to 
KVM users.

The perf_get_x86_pmu_capability() obviously needs to be revamped,
but until real effective KVM enabling work arrives, any inconsequential intrusion
into perf/core code will only lead to trivial system maintenance.
