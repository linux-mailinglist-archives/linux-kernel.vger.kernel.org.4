When I measured this patch by itself (on bpf-next), I didn't measure
any statistically significant performance gains. However, it did allow
me to avoid a regression when combined with the other linked patch (as
mentioned). I don't know if it makes sense to mention that other
change which is not even applied to any tree. I was mainly submitting
this patch from the perspective of the code being better not
contingent on any provable performance gains.

I was testing with large chunk sizes in unaligned mode (4000-4096
bytes) with ZC. For chunk sizes nearly as large as PAGE_SIZE the
unlikely path is actually the main path.

Yeah, I think that is another improvement to consider.

I agree that ZC is preferred and this patch is aimed at improving the
ZC path. The performance gain I observed was for ZC.

I totally agree that other better improvements exist but I don't think
they make this patch any less desirable. This change is only meant as
a small incremental improvement.
