If we go out of our way to pull bits out of error_code so they can be
accessed more consistently/sensibly, why introduce additional bits into
error_code in the first place? It just seems like an unecessary
intermediate step, and introduces error_code bits that TDX/selftests
don't actually ever need, which raises the specter of "what if hardware
starts using this synthetic bit for something else?"

Is it mainly to avoid introducing additional parameters to
kvm_mmu_page_fault() and instead piggy-backing off of error_code param?
Or does recording the values into error_code have a use outside of that?

Yah, that's not so bad, but it does make it more tricky to write tighter
tests since you always have to allow/handle spurious KVM_EXIT_MEMORY
faults instead of being able to individually flag those non-sensical
cases. Not a huge deal I guess.

It can actually be const using the KVM_FAULT_{VMM_DEFINED,SHARED,PRIVATE} 
abstraction. fault->is_private doesn't really need to be overwritten for
VMM_DEFINED case later, it can just be treated as "use whatever
kvm_mem_is_private() reports". But I guess that's what you mean by
"special casing" below.

Are you suggesting VMM_DEFINED would eventually go away once SNP/TDX
have bigger uptake, or maybe in favor of tests built around some new VM type
(e.g. software-protected VMs) that use guest hypercalls to set
guest-expected memory state rather than always relying on what the VMM sets
up?

I guess in that case VMM_DEFINED handling could just be dropped at
that point, and KVM_FAULT_{SHARED,PRIVATE} would still be relevant (or they
could get switched back to bool at that point), and software-protected VMs
would set that value based on whatever state tracks the hypercalls.

But if that's the end-game maybe it's a good reason for keeping
fault->is_private bool and avoiding enums. But still don't really see the
worth in also setting the bit in error_code.

Hadn't really considered fast_page_fault() for SNP... it seems like
for explicit page-state changes, the vCPU issuing the conversions
would just block until the GHCB request it issued was completed. So by
the time it accesses the GPA, KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES would have
already zapped the old entry, so the fast path would get bypassed at
that point.

For implicit page-state changes, I guess there's a risk you can
get stuck looping on fast_page_fault() since it's up to KVM MMU
to generate the KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT so KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES
gets called eventually. Sort of surprised I haven't encountered
that case though... but anyway...

If you rely on similar checks to what slow path does:

 	if (fault->is_private != kvm_mem_is_private(vcpu->kvm, fault->gfn))
 		return kvm_do_memory_fault_exit(vcpu, fault);

kvm_mem_is_private() could be stale due to unnoticed invalidation,
but eventually it would reach steady-state and the
KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT would fire. Is that sort of what you have in
mind there?

For SNP it seems more efficient to check for RMP bit and then head
straight to the slow-path, but this isn't a hot path so probably
doesn't matter much.

Introducing TDX/SNP vm types seems to buy us some flexibility so it
sounds useful.

Rather than synthesizing bits in error_code, maybe we could also use it
to help out there as well? (assuming parameter-passing was the main
use-case there)

  static bool kvm_fault_is_private(kvm, gpa, error_code)
  {
    if (kvm->vm_type == KVM_X86_TDX_VM)
      return gpa & TDX_SHARED_GPA_MASK;

    if (kvm->vm_type == KVM_X86_SNP_VM)
      return error_code & PFERR_GUEST_ENC_MASK;

    return kvm_mem_is_private(kvm, gpa);
  }

  static inline int kvm_mmu_do_page_fault(vcpu, gpa, err, ...)
  {
    struct kvm_page_fault = {
      ...
      .is_private = kvm_fault_is_private(kvm, gpa, err)
    };

    ...
  }
