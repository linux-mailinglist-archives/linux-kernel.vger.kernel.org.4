I haven't looked at the code to comment on the details, but in general the
SCMI abstraction was created and used in other kernel subsystems for couple
of reasons:

1. Leave all the protocol specific details like the version and other in
   the abstraction so that the driver remains simple and doesn't have to deal
   with those details.

2. Similar to the version and other details(generic or vendor specific), since
   there is a firmware involved, there might be need for quirks and again
   dealing with those in these SCMI layer is better as we will not have any
   specific compatible say just for pinctrl or dvfs ..etc.

3. Other reason was to allow testing of features that are in the spec and
   firmware but not used by any framework. But I think the way we introduced
   raw scmi interface nullifies it as it allows to bypass any framework and do
   raw SCMI transfers now. But originally the abstraction considered that
   possibility as well.

Yes, Xilinx people want GPIO for moving away from their custom but similar to
SCMI like interface. There are yet to start exploring details.
