 From the comments in v3, it seems to affect multiple generations, would 
it be worth proceeding with the patches by disabling it on all AMD CPUs 
to be on the safe side, until the actual issue is found and what causes 
it, and then follow up later if the issue is found by disabling it only 
on affected cpus. Maybe simply do something like below?

If you would like me to repost the rebased patches to restart the 
reviews (with do_parallel_bringup disabled for AMD), please let me know!

Thanks,
