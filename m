Oh, sorry, I meant "why this number was chosen".  PCIe r6.0, sec
7.8.2, says this capability allows software to provide "platform
latency information," so I assume this is somehow dependent on
platform, but I really don't understand the details of how LTR works,
and we didn't have an explanation before, so this was just a "if you
happen to know, it might be useful here" comment.

Right, I think it makes sense to be a DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_CLASS_FINAL(),
but I was thinking that it could be implemented in vmd.c and still be
called by the PCI core.

But now I'm uncertain since vmd.c can be compiled as a module, and I'm
not sure how that could work, since pci_fixup_device() calls things in
the __start_pci_fixups_final[] table, and I don't see how loading a
module would insert the fixup entry into that table.

So maybe it needs to be in quirks.c after all.

I think my only remaining questions here are about how to identify
devices below VMD and the order of enabling ASPM states vs setting
LTR.
