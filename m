Not necessarily. It means to describe the devices, the hardware, not
drivers.

Not necessarily. If you have one hardware, why would you split it? It's
only one memory controller, not two.

I explained - using same IO address suggests you used Linux driver
structure in your hardware description. I assume we talk here about
Devicetree. If not, that's quite different case... then I guess ACPI,
which I do not care - I am not it's maintainer.

No. Sorry, we probably talk about two different things.

You started writing that you have a hardware described as one IO address
space and now have a problem developing drivers for it.

The driver model for this is entirely different problem than problem of
accurate hardware description. Whether you described HW correct or not,
I don't know. You did not provide any details here, like DTS or bindings
(if we talk about Devicetree).

Having multiple drivers using similar resources is already solved many
times (MFD, syscon).

Whether the solution is correct or not is one more (third) topic: poking
to same IO address space from two different drivers is error-prone. This
one is solvable with splitting IO address space.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
