Thank you for explaining the concern. I now understand it fully. I have come to the
realization that enabling the vmbus device tree should not be impacted by any changes.
To address this, I will add the following lines to the HYPERV Kconfig definition I
used for testing:

	select OF if !ACPI
	select OF_EARLY_FLATTREE if !ACPI"

I am a bit unclear on the reason for adding the ranges property in the root node.
To provide more context, I have included my full device tree below. I believe that
having the ranges property in the VMBus device node is sufficient. Please let me
know if this can be improved.


/dts-v1/;

/ {
	#address-cells = <0>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	model = "microsoft,test";

	cpus {
		#address-cells = <0x01>;
		#size-cells = <0x00>;

		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x00>;
			status = "okay";
		};

		cpu@1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x01>;
			status = "okay";
		};
	};

        vmbus@ff0000000 {
            #address-cells = <2>;
            #size-cells = <2>;                            
            compatible = "microsoft,vmbus";             
            ranges = <0x0f 0xf0000000 0x0f 0xf0000000 0x0 0x10000000>;        
       };
};

Agree, and its fixed in latest version.
