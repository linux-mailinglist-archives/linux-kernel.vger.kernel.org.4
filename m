This series makes the Shadow MMU a distinct part of the KVM x86 MMU,
implemented in separate files, with a defined interface to common code.

When the TDP (Two Dimensional Paging) MMU was added to x86 KVM, it came in
a separate file with a (reasonably) clear interface. This lead to many points
in the KVM MMU like this:

if (tdp_mmu_on())
	kvm_tdp_mmu_do_stuff()

if (memslots_have_rmaps())
	/* Do whatever was being done before */

The implementations of various functions which preceded the TDP MMU have
remained scattered around mmu.c with no clear identity or interface. Over the
last couple years, the KVM x86 community has settled on calling the KVM MMU
implementation which preceded the TDP MMU the "Shadow MMU", as it grew
from shadow paging, which supported virtualization on hardware pre-TDP.

Splitting it out into separate files will give a clear interface and make it
easier to distinguish common x86 MMU code from the code specific to the two
implementations.

This series is almost all pure refactors, with just one functional
change to clean up unnecessary work in the page fault handler, revealed
by the refactors.

Patches 1 and 2 prepare for the refactor by adding files and exporting
functions.
(I'm not familiar with the current rules about copyright notices and
authorship credit, so I didn't put anything at the top of shadow_mmu.c,
but since it's going to be filled with code from mmu.c please let me
know if that should change.)

Patch 3 is the big move, transferring 3.5K lines from mmu.c to
shadow_mmu.c
(It may be best if whoever ends up preparing the pull request with
this patch just dumps my version and re-does the move so that no code is
lost.)

Patches 4-6 move the includes for paging_tmpl.h to shadow_mmu.c

Patch 9 is the only functional change, removing an unnecessary operation
from the TDP MMU PF path.

The remaining patches clean up the interface between the Shadow MMU and
common MMU code.

Patch 3 is an enormous change, and doing it all at once in a single
commit all but guarantees merge conflicts and makes it hard to review. I
don't have a good answer to this problem as there's no easy way to move
3.5K lines between files. I tried moving the code bit-by-bit but the
intermediate steps added complexity and ultimately the 50+ patches it
created didn't seem any easier to review.
Doing the big move all at once at least makes it easier to get past when
doing Git archeology, and doing it at the beggining of the series allows the
rest of the commits to still show up in Git blame.

I've tested this series on an Intel Skylake host with kvm-unit-tests and
selftests.

This series builds on 9352e7470a1b4edd2fa9d235420ecc7bc3971bdc. Sean
Christopherson suggested I send out another version right before the
beginning of a merge window so that we can merge this onto the queue early
and have time to pile everything else on top of it. I'll do that once we've
flushed out reviews and feedback.

Please consider this a replacement for the previous series of rmap
refactors I sent out. This replaces all that code movement but does not
preclude any of the great pte_list refactor / rename ideas which were
discussed there.

Thanks everyone for your feedback and happy holidays.
