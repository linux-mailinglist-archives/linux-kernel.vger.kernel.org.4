Hi Nick,

Sorry for jumping in late on an old patch set.  I just saw the LWN
article about the MODULE_LICENSE() patches and I have some comments
about duplicate symbols and a question about the motivation for this
patch set.

For livepatch we have a solution for disambiguating duplicate local
symbols called "sympos".  It works (for now) but there are some cases
(like LTO) where it falls apart and it may not be the best long term
solution.

The function granularity KASLR (fgkaslr) patches proposed a potentially
better option: use the GNU linker -zunique_symbols flag which renames
all duplicates to have unique names across the entire linked object.

There are other components which also struggle with duplicate symbols:
ftrace, kprobes, BPF, etc.  It would be good to come up with a kallsyms
solution that works for everybody.

Anyway, I was nodding along with the above cover letter until I got to
the third paragraph.

A "built-in kernel module" is not actually a module, as it's built in to
vmlinux.  I suspect the point is that if you rebuild with a different
config, it might become a module.  But many other changes could also
occur with a changed config, including changed inlining decisions and
GCC IPA optimization function renaming, in which case the symbol might
no longer exist with the new config.

Also I'm confused what it means for a symbol to be "used by multiple
modules".  If the same TU or inline symbol is linked into two modules,
it will be loaded twice at two different addresses, and the
implementations could even differ.

It sounds like there are two problems being conflated:

  1) how to uniquely identify symbols in the current kernel

     For this, all we really need is file+sym.

     Or, enable -zunique-symbols in the linker.

  2) how to uniquely identify symbols across multiple kernels/configs

     This seems much trickier, as much can change across kernels and
     configs, including compiler inlining and naming decisions, not to
     mention actual code changes.

The problems are related, but distinct.

#2 seems significantly harder to implement properly.

Would solving #1 give you most of what you need?

Based on the difficulty of #2, it really needs a proper justification.
I didn't see that in either of the patch sets.

Can you share more details about what specific problem needs solved and
why?  And how this would be used?  Examples would be helpful.

The article linked to this brief explanation [1], but that doesn't
clarify why "distinct notation used by users for things in named
modules" would be important.

Is there a reason the user can't just use whatever notation is
appropriate for their specific kernel?  Or, once we have #1, couldn't
tooling do an intermediate translation?
