Yes, I think that's what is right.

I agree that it is inappropriate to add something that was not
explicitly given. It's your tag and you define the rules. :-)

Will do. It is better done right than tonight.

You should please understand that sometimes I simply block or deadlock on
some very simple things. I have not yet implemented RCUs but rely on
evil spinlocks :-)

Thanks again. Then I'll take a beer and chill out a bit. Perhaps sniff
around if something else is left without a destructor or a release hook,
too.

However, it might be too daring to go straight into the LSM area. I am
strongly depending on your experience and mentoring, and yes, you define
the rules for assisting your team.

I just hope I did not break the Rules of Conduct. Tried to Cc: as many
maintainers as I could.

They said that every beginning is hard. But no pain, no gain :-/

Regards,
Mirsad
