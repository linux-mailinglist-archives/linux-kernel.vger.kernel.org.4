I think we have a fairly good view of what needs to be done, the rules
are the same regardless of the programming language and whether the
compiler or reviewers enforce them (Hans, Sakari, please feel free to
disagree). Thanks for your offer though, it's appreciated.

That's certainly something I would consider very positive. If anyone is
interested in having a look at (part of) the problem and possible
solutions, [1] is the most recent patch series posted to handle some of
the lifetime issues, and [2] is a more generic version of part of [1].
