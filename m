Yes, will try to be as readable next time.

Handling of padding is good.

I think this is just software definition difference whether to
include reg addr in max_raw_read/write or not, so no need to branch
the regmap implementation by a flag.

I'm a bit prefer to exclude the reg addr, as it is in stable tree now
and doesn't see strong reason to change it. And suggest regmap-i2c does
the same as spi do, that is to reserve space for reg addr/padding by
reducing the max_raw_read/write value, see:
