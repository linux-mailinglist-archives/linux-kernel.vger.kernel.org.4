You slightly misremembered, but are still correct with the above ;-) .

I.e. what we talked about was stuff for fixes for 6.1-rc, were Palmers
wisely wanted to limit additions to really easy fixes for the remaining
last rc, to not upset any existing boards.

But you are still correct that we also shouldn't target the 6.2 merge window
anymore :-) .

We're after -rc8 now (which is in itself uncommon) and in his -rc7
announcement [0], Linus stated

"[...] the usual rule is that things that I get sent for the
merge window should have been all ready _before_ the merge window
opened. But with the merge window happening largely during the holiday
season, I'll just be enforcing that pretty strictly."

That means new stuff should be reviewed and in linux-next _way before_ the
merge window opens next weekend. Taking into account that people need
to review stuff (and maybe the series needing another round), I really don't
see this happening this week and everything else will get us shouted at
from atop a christmas tree ;-) .

That's the reason most maintainer-trees stop accepting stuff after -rc7
