Yes, that's very rigorous. Will check and add these for all features in
this patch series.

Yes. A few words of description is necessary here.

Features which has been enabled in kernel usually should be added to
/proc/cpuinfo.

The first way is often used for bit whose leaf has many other bits in
use. It's very simple to do, just adding one line for each feature based
on existing words in can get the effect.

For those bits whose leaf has just a few bits in use, they should be
defined in a 'scattered' way. However, this kind of features in this
patch series have no other kernel usage and they just need to be
advertised to kvm userspace. Therefore, define them in a kvm-only way is
more explicit.

Appreciate your very detailed suggestions. Thanks very much!
