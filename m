Hello Elad! I hope that would not bothering you. We are doing here
cleanup of kernel code for older Marvell SoCs (Orion) and there one
unknown thing about 88F5181's 0x10008 register. See below.

In linked public document I found same thing. Register is for 88F5182
reserved. (You have typo in comment, it is 88F5182, not *52).

I have feeling that for 88F5181 it is not reserved and has to be
configured correctly. (Also typo in your comment, it is 88F5181, not *51).
But I have not found any copy of 88F5181 user manual document on internet.

In past 88F518x and 88F528x documents and user manuals were available
publicly on Marvell website, visible from web archive:
https://web.archive.org/web/20080607215437/http://www.marvell.com/products/media/index.jsp

But Marvell deleted these documents from their public website and for
kernel developers they are now probably lost. I do not know about any
other backups.


Elad, could you please help us? Do you have access to functional
specifications / user manuals for 88F518x and 88F528x or have
information how kernel developers can get access to those documents?
Hopefully they were not totally lost. We just need explanation for
register 'Device Multiplex Control Register' Offset: 0x10008.
