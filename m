In the configuration we are having issues with, the downstream device
is indeed a 2.5GT downstream, and the upstream is configured to
support 2.5GT and 5GT (Armada 385). So it does make sense that this
known issue would apply. I tested setting the target speed to 2.5GT
within mvebu_pcie_setup_hw before the retraining occurs, and it does
resolve the retraining delay/link drop. So this issue is indeed the
problem we are having. Is this behaviour mentioned in any errata?

By programming the Target Link Speed, are you referring to programming
the value like other controller drivers do with dtb configuration?
Relying on this would be problematic for our design (mixed downstream
link speed variants). Does it make more sense to set the Target Link
Speed when the retrain bit is being set in Link Control (e.g. in the
mvebu_pci_bridge_emul_pcie_conf_write function) essentially preventing
the retraining from causing the link to drop only when the issue is
expected to present itself (Link Status at 2.5GT)?

Thanks,
Nathan
