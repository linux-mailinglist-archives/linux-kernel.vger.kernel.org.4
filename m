Thanks for the testing and reviews, Marcos.

The selftests are the first level of testing... we should probably
tackle a real or simulated CVE fix to see how well the tooling fits
larger livepatches.

One complication that I can envision is symbol positioning.  Currently,
the klp-convert annotations are a direct mirror of the kernel's
<obj,symbol,pos> tuple.  It should be possible to make this a bit more
user friendly for the livepatch developer if the annotations were
<obj,file,symbol>, as derived from the vmlinux / module.tmp.ko symbol
tables.

For example, the following code:

  KLP_MODULE_RELOC(test_klp_convert_mod, test_klp_convert_mod_b.c) test_klp_convert_mod_relocs_b[] = {
        KLP_SYMPOS(homonym_string),
        KLP_SYMPOS(get_homonym_string),
  };

could generate the following relocations:

  Relocation section '.rela.klp.module_relocs.test_klp_convert_mod.test_klp_convert_mod_b.c' at offset 0x1dc0 contains 2 entries:
      Offset             Info             Type               Symbol's Value  Symbol's Name + Addend
  0000000000000000  0000003f00000001 R_X86_64_64            0000000000000000 homonym_string + 0
  0000000000000008  0000004900000001 R_X86_64_64            0000000000000000 get_homonym_string + 0

for which klp-convert looks up in symbols.klp:

  klp-convert-symbol-data.0.2
  *vmlinux
  ...
  *test_klp_convert_mod
  -test_klp_convert_mod_a.c             << added filenames to the format
  test_klp_get_driver_name
  driver_name
  get_homonym_string                    << sympos = 1
  homonym_string                        << sympos = 1
  ...
  -test_klp_convert_mod_b.c
  get_homonym_string                    << sympos = 2
  homonym_string                        << sympos = 2
  ...

and then generates the usual klp-relocations as currently defined.

(Unfortunately full pathnames are not saved in the STT_FILE symbol table
entries, so there will be a few non-unique <obj,file,symbol> entries.  I
believe the last time this was discussed, we found that there were a
relatively small number of such symbols.)

Have you tried retrofitting klp-convert into any real-world livepatch?
I'm curious as to your observations on the overall experience, or
thoughts on the sympos annotation style noted above.
