Our plan is to start testing new livepatches with klp-convert to ensure that it
works as expected, removing the need of kallsyms_lookup. Let's see how it goes
in the next few weeks.

This can get verbose very quickly, but I liked the idea. The sympos is much more
cryptic than specifying the file where the symbol lives on.

As I mentioned I'll start using klp-convert with new livepaches for testing
purposes in the next coming weeks. I'll reply in a few weeks about the
experience so far.
