My concern is that I don't know why this patch is here.  There should be
a very simple answer to the question: Why does RISC-V need this patch
but x86 does not?

Ahh, OK, that's a familiar problem.  I see the connection to device
filtering now.

Is this functionality in the current set?  I went looking for it and all
I found was the host notification side.

Is this the only mechanism by which the guest tells the TSM which parts
of the guest physical address space can be exposed to the host?

For TDX and SEV, that information is inferred from a bit in the page
tables.  Essentially, there are dedicated guest physical addresses that
tell the hardware how to treat the mappings: should the secure page
tables or the host's EPT/NPT be consulted?

If that mechanism is different for RISC-V, it would go a long way to
explaining why RISC-V needs this patch.

Makes sense, thanks for the explanation.

Yeah, TDX does:

1. Guest MMIO access
2. Guest #VE handler (if the access faults)
3. Guest hypercall->host
4. Host fixes the fault
5. Hypercall returns, guest returns from #VE via IRET
6. Guest retries MMIO instruction

From what you said, RISC-V appears to do:

1. Guest MMIO access
2. Host MMIO handler
3. Host handles the fault, returns
4. Guest retries MMIO instruction

In other words, this mechanism does the same thing but short-circuits
the trip through #VE and the hypercall.

What happens if this ioremap() hook is not in place?  Does the hardware
(or TSM) generate an exception like TDX gets?  If so, it's probably
possible to move this "notify the TSM" code to that exception handler
instead of needing an ioremap() hook.

I'm not saying that it's _better_ to do that, but it would allow you to
get rid of this patch for now and get me to shut up. :)

Just to close the loop here, please go take a look at
pgprot_decrypted().  That's where the x86 guest page table bit gets to
tell the hardware that the mapping might cause a #VE and is under the
control of the host.  That's the extent of what x86 does at ioremap() time.

So, to summarize, we have:

x86:
1. Guest page table bit to mark shared (host) vs. private (guest)
   control
2. #VE if there is a fault on a shared mapping to call into the host

RISC-V:
1. Guest->TSM call to mark MMIO vs. private
2. Faults in the MMIO area are then transparent to the guest

That design difference would, indeed, help explain why this patch is
here.  I'm still not 100% convinced that the patch is *required*, but I
at least understand how we arrived here.
