Ugh, that's a terrible API.  The entire page track API is a mess, e.g. KVMGT is
forced to grab its own references to KVM and also needs to manually acquire/release
mmu_lock in some flows but not others.

Anyways, this is a flaw in the page track API that should be fixed.  Flushing a
slot should not be overloaded to imply "this slot is gone", it should be a flush
command, no more, no less.

AFAICT, KVMGT never flushes anything, so fixing the bug should be a simple matter
of adding another hook that's invoked when the memory region change is committed.

That would allow KVMGT to fix another bug.  If a memory region is moved and the
new region partially overlaps the old region, KVMGT technically probably wants to
retain its write-protection scheme.  Though that's probably not worth supporting,
might be better to say "don't move memory regions if KVMGT is enabled", because
AFAIK there is no VMM that actually moves memory regions (KVM's MOVE support was
broken for years and no one noticed).

Actually, given that MOVE + KVMGT probably doesn't work regardless of where the
region is moved to, maybe we can get away with rejecting MOVE if an external
page tracker cares about the slot in question.

IIUC, this is purely a theoretical bug and practically speaking can't be a problem
in practice, at least not without completely breaking KVMGT.

On DELETE, kvm_prepare_memory_region() will never fail on x86 (s390's ultravisor
protected VM case is the only scenario where DELETE can fail on any architecture).
The common code in kvm_prepare_memory_region() does nothing for DELETE, ditto for
kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region().

And for MOVE, it can only fail in two scenarios: (1) the end gfn is beyond the
max gfn, i.e. userspace gave bad input or (2) the new memslot is unaligned but
the old memslot was not, and so KVM needs to allocate new metadata due to the new
memslot needed larger arrays.

As above MOVE is not handled correctly by KVMGT, so I highly doubt there is a VMM
that supports KVMGT and moves relevant memory regions, let alove does something
that can result in MOVE failing _and_ moves the memslot that KVMGT is shadowing.

Heh, and MOVE + KVM_MEM_LOG_DIRTY_PAGES is also arguably broken, as KVM reuses
the existing dirty bitmap but doesn't shift the dirty bits.  This is likely
another combination that KVM can simply reject.

Assuming this is indeed purely theoretical, that should be called out in the
changelog.  Or as above, simply disallow MOVE in this case, which probably has
my vote.

I'm not 100% sure that simply moving kvm_invalidate_memslot() is functionally
correct.  It might be, but there are so many subtleties in this code that I don't
want to change this ordering unless absolutely necessary, or at least not without
an in-depth analysis and a pile of tests.  E.g. it's possible one or more
architectures relies on unmapping, flushing, and invalidating the old region
prior to preparing the new region, e.g. to reuse arch memslot data.
