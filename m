This all sounds fine to me, and the patch itself looks good.

I built an arm64 kernel with the first three patches from this series applied
atop v6.3-rc3, with defconfig + CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK=y +
CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE=y + CONFIG_KASAN_STACK=y. I then hotplugged a cpu with:

  while true; do
    echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online;
    echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online;
  done

... and that was perfectly happy to run for minutes with no unexpected failures.

To make sure I wasn't avoiding issues by chance, I also tried with each of
scs_task_reset() and kasan_unpoison_task_stack() commented out. With
scs_task_reset() commented out, cpu re-onlining fails after a few iterations,
and with kasan_unpoison_task_stack() commented out I get a KASAN splat upon the
first re-onlining. So that all looks good.

FWIW, for the first three patches:
