Intel Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX) protects guest VMs from malicious
host and certain physical attacks.  TDX specs are available in [1].

This series is the initial support to enable TDX with minimal code to
allow KVM to create and run TDX guests.  KVM support for TDX is being
developed separately[2].  A new "userspace inaccessible memfd" approach
to support TDX private memory is also being developed[3].  The KVM will
only support the new "userspace inaccessible memfd" as TDX guest memory.

Also, a few first generations of TDX hardware have an erratum[4], and
require additional handing.

This series doesn't aim to support all functionalities, and doesn't aim
to resolve all things perfectly.  All other optimizations will be posted
as follow-up once this initial TDX support is upstreamed.

(For memory hotplug, sorry for broadcasting widely but I cc'ed the
linux-mm@kvack.org following Kirill's suggestion so MM experts can also
help to provide comments.)

Hi Dave/Kirill/Tony/David and all,

Thanks for your review on the previous versions.  Appreciate your review
on this version and any tag if patches look good to you.  Thanks!

----- Changelog history: ------

- v11 -> v12:
 - Addressed comments in v11 from Dave/Kirill/David and others.
 - Collected review tags from Dave/Kirill/David and others.
 - Splitted the SEAMCALL infrastructure patch into 2 patches for better
   reveiw.
 - One more patch to change to keep TDMRs when module initialization is
   successful for better review.

 v11: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1685887183.git.kai.huang@intel.com/T/

- v10 -> v11:

 - Addressed comments in v10
 - Added patches to handle TDX "partial write machine check" erratum.
 - Added a new patch to handle running out of entropy in common code.
 - Fixed a bug in kexec() support.

 v10: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/cover.1678111292.git.kai.huang@intel.com/

- v9 -> v10:

 - Changed the per-cpu initalization handling
   - Gave up "ensuring all online cpus are TDX-runnable when TDX module
     is initialized", but just provide two basic functions, tdx_enable()
     and tdx_cpu_enable(), to let the user of TDX to make sure the
     tdx_cpu_enable() has been done successfully when the user wants to
     use particular cpu for TDX.
   - Thus, moved per-cpu initialization out of tdx_enable().  Now
     tdx_enable() just assumes VMXON and tdx_cpu_enable() has been done
     on all online cpus before calling it.
   - Merged the tdx_enable() skeleton patch and per-cpu initialization
     patch together to tell better story.
   - Moved "SEAMCALL infrastructure" patch before the tdx_enable() patch.

 v9: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1676286526.git.kai.huang@intel.com/

 - Simplified the "skeletion patch" as a result of removing
   TDH.SYS.LP.INIT patch.
 - Refined changelog/comments for most of the patches (to tell better
   story, remove silly comments, etc) (Dave).
 - Added new 'struct tdmr_info_list' struct, and changed all TDMR related
   patches to use it (Dave).
 - Effectively merged patch "Reserve TDX module global KeyID" and
   "Configure TDX module with TDMRs and global KeyID", and removed the
   static variable 'tdx_global_keyid', following Dave's suggestion on
   making tdx_sysinfo local variable.
 - For detailed changes please see individual patch changelog history.

    internal discussion).
  - Added one patch to introduce enum type for TDX supported page size
    level to replace the hard-coded values in TDX guest code (Dave).
  - Added one patch to make TDX depends on X2APIC being enabled (Dave).
  - Added one patch to build all boot-time present memory regions as TDX
    memory during kernel boot.
  - Added Reviewed-by from others to some patches.

 v5: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/529a22d05e21b9218dc3f29c17ac5a176334cac1.camel@intel.com/T/

- v4 -> v5:

  This is essentially a resent of v4.  Sorry I forgot to consult
  get_maintainer.pl when sending out v4, so I forgot to add linux-acpi
  and linux-mm mailing list and the relevant people for 4 new patches.

  changelog histroy of individual patches (I just used v3 -> v5 since
  there's basically no code change to v4).

 - Changed from using e820 to using memblock to convert system RAM to TDX
   memory.
 - Excluded legacy PMEM from TDX memory.
 - Removed the boot-time command line to disable TDX patch.

== Background ==

TDX introduces a new CPU mode called Secure Arbitration Mode (SEAM)
and a new isolated range pointed by the SEAM Ranger Register (SEAMRR).
A CPU-attested software module called 'the TDX module' runs in the new
isolated region as a trusted hypervisor to create/run protected VMs.

TDX also leverages Intel Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption (MKTME) to
provide crypto-protection to the VMs.  TDX reserves part of MKTME KeyIDs
as TDX private KeyIDs, which are only accessible within the SEAM mode.

TDX is different from AMD SEV/SEV-ES/SEV-SNP, which uses a dedicated
secure processor to provide crypto-protection.  The firmware runs on the
secure processor acts a similar role as the TDX module.

The host kernel communicates with SEAM software via a new SEAMCALL
instruction.  This is conceptually similar to a guest->host hypercall,
except it is made from the host to SEAM software instead.

Before being able to manage TD guests, the TDX module must be loaded
and properly initialized.  This series assumes the TDX module is loaded
by BIOS before the kernel boots.

How to initialize the TDX module is described at TDX module 1.0
specification, chapter "13.Intel TDX Module Lifecycle: Enumeration,
Initialization and Shutdown".

== Design Considerations ==

1. Initialize the TDX module at runtime

There are basically two ways the TDX module could be initialized: either
in early boot, or at runtime before the first TDX guest is run.  This
series implements the runtime initialization.

Also, TDX requires a per-cpu initialization SEAMCALL to be done before
making any SEAMCALL on that cpu.

This series adds two functions: tdx_cpu_enable() and tdx_enable() to do
per-cpu initialization and module initialization respectively.

2. CPU hotplug

DX doesn't support physical (ACPI) CPU hotplug.  A non-buggy BIOS should
never support hotpluggable CPU devicee and/or deliver ACPI CPU hotplug
event to the kernel.  This series doesn't handle physical (ACPI) CPU
hotplug at all but depends on the BIOS to behave correctly.

Also, tdx_cpu_enable() will simply return error for any hot-added cpu if
something insane happened.

Note TDX works with CPU logical online/offline, thus this series still
allows to do logical CPU online/offline.

3. Kernel policy on TDX memory

The TDX module reports a list of "Convertible Memory Region" (CMR) to
indicate which memory regions are TDX-capable.  The TDX architecture
allows the VMM to designate specific convertible memory regions as usable
for TDX private memory.

The initial support of TDX guests will only allocate TDX private memory
from the global page allocator.  This series chooses to designate _all_
system RAM in the core-mm at the time of initializing TDX module as TDX
memory to guarantee all pages in the page allocator are TDX pages.

4. Memory Hotplug

After the kernel passes all "TDX-usable" memory regions to the TDX
module, the set of "TDX-usable" memory regions are fixed during module's
runtime.  No more "TDX-usable" memory can be added to the TDX module
after that.

To achieve above "to guarantee all pages in the page allocator are TDX
pages", this series simply choose to reject any non-TDX-usable memory in
memory hotplug.

5. Physical Memory Hotplug

Note TDX assumes convertible memory is always physically present during
machine's runtime.  A non-buggy BIOS should never support hot-removal of
any convertible memory.  This implementation doesn't handle ACPI memory
removal but depends on the BIOS to behave correctly.

Also, if something insane really happened, 4) makes sure either TDX
cannot be enabled or hot-added memory will be rejected after TDX gets
enabled.

6. Kexec()

Similar to AMD's SME, in kexec() kernel needs to flush dirty cachelines
of TDX private memory otherwise they may silently corrupt the new kernel.

7. TDX erratum

The first few generations of TDX hardware have an erratum.  A partial
write to a TDX private memory cacheline will silently "poison" the
line.  Subsequent reads will consume the poison and generate a machine
check.

The fast warm reset reboot doesn't reset TDX private memory.  With this
erratum, all TDX private pages needs to be converted back to normal
before a fast warm reset reboot or booting to the new kernel in kexec().
Otherwise, the new kernel may get unexpected machine check.

In normal condition, triggering the erratum in Linux requires some kind
of kernel bug involving relatively exotic memory writes to TDX private
memory and will manifest via spurious-looking machine checks when
reading the affected memory.  Machine check handler is improved to deal
with such machine check.
