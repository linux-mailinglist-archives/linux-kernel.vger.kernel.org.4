Sure, will do!

Reviewers (and in your case maintainers) get far too little credit, so
I'd rather keep that tag, if you don't mind that hard ;)

See what you did? You even went that far and re-read the manual.
Definitely deserves credit!

Looks much simpler, indeed. But might deserve a little comment itself
why it's fine test 'tdp_enabled' only...

...and there it is already! :D

Thanks, Sean! Sounds all very good to me. I'll cook up these commits, do
some more tests and send a v4 tomorrow, if time allows.
