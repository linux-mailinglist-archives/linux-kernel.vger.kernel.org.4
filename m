We're in a situation that is not perfect, we got several reports that
were from old compilers but we know most of them were false positives. On
the other hand we want to enable more warnings that make sense to us
(because we can fix/work around them) but can't be yet enabled globally
for linux.

I take the reports or patches as the price for that, so far the number
hasn't been anything near unmanageable. I evaluate each fix in the
context of the code regardless of the compiler, i.e. the code logic must
be correct so it's not a 'no-brainer initialize to 0'. If 0 is the sane
default or detectable invalid value then yes, of course. It might need
some more code restructuring but I don't remember or have an example of
that. Usually just initializing the variable was sufficient.

We cannot expect that everybody has the most up to date version of the
compiler, the minimum currently required for gcc is 5.1
(Documentation/process/changes.rst). I take it as this is the minimum
and anything from that is relevant for reports and fixes. This is what
provides testing coverage, build and runtime.

You can simply skip the warning fix patches, I need to look at them
anyway and I don't mind. I might ask you for an opinion if the suggested
fix is correct in case it's the code I know you do understand well.
