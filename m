The sync is presumably causing an EXT4 journal commit which
seems to use REQ_PREFLUSH and REQ_FUA. That is:
	Flush (the journal to media)
	Write (the commit record) (FUA)
So it does a flush anyway.  The no-FUA case is:
	Flush (the journal to media)
	Write (the commit record)
	Flush (the commit record)

There is definitely less protocol overhead because the no-FUA
case has to do an extra CMD6 (flush) and CMD13.

Note also, in this case auto-CMD23 is being used, which is why
is is not listed.

Using an older system (no CQE but also auto-CMD23), resulted
in a win for no-FUA:

		With FUA		Without FUA

		Reliable Write	1200	Write	 850
		CMD13		 100	CMD13	 100
					Flush	 120
					CMD13	  65
		Total		1300		1135
