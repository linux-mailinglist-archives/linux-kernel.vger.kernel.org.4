Yeah, that sounds reasonable even if there apparently are some
differences between mainline and what you run in ChromeOS here.

Interesting, as VTs are still broken in with rc4 on the X13s (and
sc8280xp CRD).

Does anyone have any ideas of why things break on mainline with these
machines? Any patches or tests I can try?

Dmitry, do you have an X13s now that you can reproduce this on?
