People who are currently using tboot are only getting SHA-1, so there's 
no obvious reason for them to have added support yet. *My* tooling all 
supports SHA-2 so I'm completely fine here, but either we refuse to 
support a bunch of hardware or we have to support SHA-1 anyway, and if 
we have to support it the only reason not to implement it even in the 
"SHA-2 is supported" case is because we have opinions about how other 
people implement their security.
