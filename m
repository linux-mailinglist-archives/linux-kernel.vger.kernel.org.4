The series is about adding a taint for, so discussing the user
experience, when someone reports a "tainted crash" seems reasonable to
me and not off topic.

Masami, this seems accusational and counter productive, it was never
said that issues can be solved without investigation.

The BPF CI does find issues, the BPF reviewers and maintainers
regularly fix bugs using it. Alexei's point here is that a taint does
not help in solving the problem, rather deter some people from even
looking at it. (not BPF people, but other maintainers [distro, kernel]
who would ask for a reproduction without a taint).

Let's take a step back and focus on solving debuggability and
introspection as we clearly have some perception issues about taints
in the community. (distro maintainers, users) before we go and add
more taints.

I am sorry, but it's our responsibility as developers to design
features so that users don't face arduous pushbacks.

This is already the case with BPF, the modify return trampolines
further limits the error injection to functions that return errors.

This is the case with modify_return trampolines in BPF which avoid
side effects and limit the attachment surface further and avoiding
side effects is a design goal. If we missed anything, let's fix that.

I think careful choices need to be made on when error injection is
allowed so that these situations don't occur. (as you mentioned in
your comment). [1]. If a BPF program is unloaded, there is no error
injection any more, let's ensure that we design the error injection
allow list and the BPF logic to ensure this cannot happen.

I would like us to focus on debuggability as it helps both the
maintainers and the user. And I see a few things that need to be done:

1. Revisit what is allowed for error injection in the kernel and if
they can cause any subtle issues. My initial take is that functions
that are directly called from syscall path should generally be okay.
But let's check them for the patterns you mentioned.
2. If it helps, add the list of BPF modify return programs to stack
traces. Although this is really needed if we don't do [1] properly.
3. Check if anything needs to be improved in the verification logic
for modify return trampolines.
