The old key has the same byte size but all bytes must be within the 
hex-ascíi range of characters, otherwise it is refused by the kernel.
So if you wanted a 32 bytes key you get 16 effective bytes for the key. 
In the above example the string size of the $BROKENKEY is 32, while 
the string size of the $NEWKEY is 64.

If you do

$ echo $NEWKEY
6162636465664142434445463132333435363738393061616161616161616161

for the example, the range problem is obvious, so $NEWKEY is still broken. 
That's why it should only be used to recover data which should be 
reencypted with a new key. If you count exactly, the effective key size is 
_slightly_ longer than half of the specified size, but it is still a 
severe security problem.

As long as the patch is not accepted the discussion is helpful. But feel 
free to delete it upon integration ;-).
