No, the above statement is not correct. Let's assume that if the AER
feature is owned by firmware and OS arbitrarily configures the AER
registers, does it seem right? If firmware or OS owns a feature, after
_OSC negotiation, it assumed that other component will not touch the
relevant registers. There could be exceptions (like EDR), but it needs
to be documented in the spec.

with AER register, it will not be able to handle the runtime hot reset and link retrain cases in addition to the hotplug case you mentioned below.

IIUC, here we are trying to use HEST table to configure AER registers.
Does HEST table override the _OSC based ownership? Can we assume if
HEST table exist, then irrespective who owns the feature (firmware or
OS), OS is allowed to configure the AER registers? Is there a spec
statement confirming the above assumption?

The ACPI Spec has the following description: PCI Express (PCIe) root ports may implement PCIe Advanced Error Reporting (AER) support. This table(HEST) contains  information platform firmware supplies to OSPM for configuring AER support on a given root port. We understand that HEST stands for user to express expectations.
