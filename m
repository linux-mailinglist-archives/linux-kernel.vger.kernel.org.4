Yes, such mistakes are more egregious in the sense they are harder to find and
have more severe consequences, but I don't think the mistakes are necessarily
harder to make.  Bugs in simple usage patterns are easy to spot, but at the same
time they're also less likely to be buggy because they're simpler.

Only because the length/capacity wasn't immutable, i.e. that particilar bug couldn't
have been introduced in the first place if kvm_gpc_activate() was the only "public"
API that allowed "changing" the length.

That's really what I dislike.  I have no objection to adding a sanity check, what
I think is broken and dangerous is allowing a gpc->gpa to effectively become valid
by refreshing with a smaller length.

The gfn_to_hva_cache APIs have the same problem, but they get away with it because
they don't support concurrent usage and don't have to deal with invalidation events.

Lastly, if we keep "length" then we also need to keep "gpa", otherwise the resulting
API is all kinds of funky.

E.g. I'd be totally ok with something like this that would allow users to opt-in
to sanity checking their usage.

int __kvm_gpc_lock(struct gfn_to_pfn_cache *gpc)
{
	int r;

	read_lock_irqsave(&gpc->lock, gpc->flags);

	while (kvm_gpc_check(gpc)) {
                 read_unlock_irqrestore(&gpc->lock, gpc->flags);

                 r = kvm_gpc_refresh(gpc);
		 if (r)
                         return r;

                 read_lock_irqsave(&gpc->lock, gpc->flags);
	}

	return 0;
}

int kvm_gpc_lock(struct gfn_to_pfn_cache *gpc, gpa_t gpa, unsigned long len)
{
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(gpa < gpc->gpa || (gpa + len > PAGE_SIZE) ||
			 ((gpa & PAGE_MASK) != (gpc->gpa & PAGE_MASK)))
		return -EINVAL;	

	return __kvm_gpc_lock(gpc);
}
