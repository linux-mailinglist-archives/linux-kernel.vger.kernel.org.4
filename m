This is what seems strange to me.  Are you saying that Windows never
enables these power-saving features?  Or that Windows includes quirks
for all these broken BIOSes?  Neither idea seems very convincing.

A boot-time parameter for debugging and workarounds is fine.  IMO,
needing a boot-time parameter in the course of normal operation is
not OK.
