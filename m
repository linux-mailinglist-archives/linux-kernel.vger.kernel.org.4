Subject: [PATCH v6 00/21] timer: Move from a push remote at enqueue to a pull at expiry model

Placing timers at enqueue time on a target CPU based on dubious heuristics
does not make any sense:

 1) Most timer wheel timers are canceled or rearmed before they expire.

 2) The heuristics to predict which CPU will be busy when the timer expires
    are wrong by definition.

So placing the timers at enqueue wastes precious cycles.

The proper solution to this problem is to always queue the timers on the
local CPU and allow the non pinned timers to be pulled onto a busy CPU at
expiry time.

Therefore split the timer storage into local pinned and global timers:
Local pinned timers are always expired on the CPU on which they have been
queued. Global timers can be expired on any CPU.

As long as a CPU is busy it expires both local and global timers. When a
CPU goes idle it arms for the first expiring local timer. If the first
expiring pinned (local) timer is before the first expiring movable timer,
then no action is required because the CPU will wake up before the first
movable timer expires. If the first expiring movable timer is before the
first expiring pinned (local) timer, then this timer is queued into a idle
timerqueue and eventually expired by some other active CPU.

To avoid global locking the timerqueues are implemented as a hierarchy. The
lowest level of the hierarchy holds the CPUs. The CPUs are associated to
groups of 8, which are separated per node. If more than one CPU group
exist, then a second level in the hierarchy collects the groups. Depending
on the size of the system more than 2 levels are required. Each group has a
"migrator" which checks the timerqueue during the tick for remote timers to
be expired.

If the last CPU in a group goes idle it reports the first expiring event in
the group up to the next group(s) in the hierarchy. If the last CPU goes
idle it arms its timer for the first system wide expiring timer to ensure
that no timer event is missed.


Testing
~~~~~~~

The impact of wasting cycles during enqueue by using the heuristic in
contrast to always queuing the timer on the local CPU was measured with a
micro benchmark. Therefore a timer is enqueued and dequeued in a loop with
1000 repetitions on a isolated CPU. The time the loop takes is measured. A
quarter of the remaining CPUs was kept busy. This measurement was repeated
several times. With the patch queue the average duration was reduced by
approximately 25%.

	145ns	plain v6
	109ns	v6 with patch queue


Furthermore the impact of residence in deep idle states of an idle system
was investigated. The patch queue doesn't downgrade this behavior.


During testing on a mostly idle machine a ping pong game could be observed:
a process_timeout timer is expired remotely on a non idle CPU. Then the CPU
where the schedule_timeout() was executed to enqueue the timer comes out of
idle and restarts the timer using schedule_timeout() and goes back to idle
again. This is due to the fair scheduler which tries to keep the task on
the CPU which it previously executed on.


Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

Simple deferrable timers are no longer required as they can be converted to
global timers. If a CPU goes idle, a formerly deferrable timer will not
prevent the CPU to sleep as long as possible. Only the last migrator CPU
has to take care of them. Deferrable timers with timer pinned flags needs
to be expired on the specified CPU but must not prevent CPU from going
idle. They require their own timer base which is never taken into account
when calculating the next expiry time. This conversation and required
cleanup will be done in a follow up series.


v5..v6:

  - Address review of Frederic Weisbecker and Peter Zijlstra (spelling,
    locking, race in tmigr_handle_remote_cpu())

  - unconditionally set TIMER_PINNED flag in add_timer_on(); introduce
    add_timer() variants which set/unset TIMER_PINNED flag; drop fixing
    add_timer_on() call sites, as TIMER_PINNED flag is set implicitly;
    Fixing workqueue to use add_timer_global() instead of simply
    add_timer() for unbound work.

  - Drop support for siblings to end up in the same level 0 group (could be
    added again in a better way as an improvement later on)

  - Do not send IPI for new first deferrable timers

v4..v5:
  - address review feedback of Frederic Weisbecker
  - fix issue with group timer update after remote expiry

v3..v4:
  - address review feedback of Frederic Weisbecker
  - address kernel test robot fallout
  - Move patch 16 "add_timer_on(): Make sure callers have TIMER_PINNED
    flag" at the begin of the queue to prevent timers to end up in global
    timer base when they were queued using add_timer_on()
  - Fix some comments and typos

v2..v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20170418111102.490432548@linutronix.de/
  - Minimize usage of locks by storing data using atomic_cmpxchg() for
    migrator information and information about active cpus.


Thanks,
