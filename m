This seems unfortunate. Presumably we're not able to modify the PMRs at 
this point? This also seems like a potential issue for IOMMU config in 
general - the presumption is that the firmware should be configuring the 
IOMMU in such a way that DMA-capable devices can't attack the firmware 
while we're in the boot environment, and if KASLR is leaving a window 
there then it seems like we'd need to fix that?

If we're in an insecure state, is that something that would show up in 
the form of different measurements?
