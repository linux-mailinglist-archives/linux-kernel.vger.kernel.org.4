No good reason for 256KB.  We know it needs to be at least 64KB for
the X1 Carbon.  I picked 4x bigger just for headroom, since I assume
the 64KB is platform-specific host bridge registers or something.  Do
you think a bigger number would be better, i.e., we would retain more
MMIO things in E820?

ECAM areas would be 1MB per bus, so between 1MB and 256MB.  Those areas
*should* be reserved by PNP0C02 _CRS, but IIRC the early MMCONFIG code
checks E820, and the late code checks for _CRS.  I guess one could
argue that ignoring those, e.g., by retaining anything 256MB or
smaller in E820, would reduce the amount of change.  

But if the host bridge _CRS includes 256MB of legitimate window that
EFI says is MMIO and is hence included in E820, that seems like kind
of a lot of usable window space to give up.

Right, makes sense.
