Oh my, it really is that simple.

Indeed, enabling this in the pre-kexec kernel fixes it all up. I had
blindly disabled it in my quest to downsize the pre-kexec kernel to
reduce boot time (it only runs a bootloader). In hindsight, the firmware
drivers section is not really a good section to tweak on a whim.

I'm terribly sorry to have taken your time to "fix" this "bug". But I
must ask, is there any reason why this is a visible config option, or at
least not gated behind CONFIG_EXPERT? drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-map.c
is pretty tiny, & considering it depends on CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE, one
probably wants to have kexec work properly if they can even enable it.
I admit the help text for it is arguably pretty good, but I feel like
the config option is only really useful for embedded, the same
enviroments where people would disable stuff like CONFIG_DMI -- a config
option that I would argue is pretty justifiably gated behind
CONFIG_EXPERT, because far too many systems break without it & it's
pretty small code, so really not worth it unless you absolutely know
what you're doing. Similarly, I don't really think there's much value
in disabling the ability to kexec without the firmware except if you're
heavily informed & must have the size reduction, especially since in
EFI land that's where your DMI info comes from, if I were to argue for
it on the basis of CONFIG_DMI being gated. In summary, it can cause
quite a bit of unnecessary confusion despite only being useful to a very
small minority of users.

Thank you!
