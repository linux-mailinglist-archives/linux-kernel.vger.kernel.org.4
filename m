It is useful information that we already have and used to dump. It's
not really about which memcg the victim lived in, but which memcg is
not behaving as expected causing an OOM. If you have processes running
in the OOMing memcg itself as well as its descendants, then it's nice
to get an idea of which memcg's usage is not as expected.

Agreed, but for this case there is really no reason to change the
behavior, and imo making restoring the behavior makes the code cleaner
/ more consistent.

I don't think the collection of these stats is v2-specific, I was just
testing in a VM without swap, and the process had 100% anonymous
memory. Testing with swap gives sane stats:
[   68.851724] pgscan 248801
[   68.851725] pgsteal 123081
[   68.851725] pgscan_kswapd 0
[   68.851726] pgscan_direct 248801
[   68.851727] pgscan_khugepaged 0
[   68.851727] pgsteal_kswapd 0
[   68.851728] pgsteal_direct 123081
[   68.851728] pgsteal_khugepaged 0

However, I still think this change is valuable. Like you mentioned,
the OOM log is not set in stone, but we shouldn't just change it for
no reason. In this case, for cgroup v1 users, the OOM log changed for
no reason beyond a side effect of another patch. Upon upgrading our
kernel we noticed the behavior change. This patch restores the old
behavior without any cost really, and it makes the code a tiny bit
more consistent.
