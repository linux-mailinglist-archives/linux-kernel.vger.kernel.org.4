The Qualcomm LLCC/EDAC drivers were using a fixed register stride for
accessing the (Control and Status Regsiters) CSRs of each LLCC bank.
This offset only works for some SoCs like SDM845 for which driver support
was initially added.
    
But the later SoCs use different register stride that vary between the
banks with holes in-between. So it is not possible to use a single register
stride for accessing the CSRs of each bank. By doing so could result in a
crash with the current drivers. So far this crash is not reported since
EDAC_QCOM driver is not enabled in ARM64 defconfig and no one tested the
driver extensively by triggering the EDAC IRQ (that's where each bank
CSRs are accessed).

For fixing this issue, let's obtain the base address of each LLCC bank from
devicetree and get rid of the fixed stride.

This series has been tested on SM8250, SM8450, SM6350, SC8280XP, SA8540P,
and SDM845.

Merging strategy
----------------

Patches 1/17, 2/17 and 3/17 can be merged independently to EDAC tree. Rest of
the patches should be merged to qcom tree due to LLCC dependency.

Thanks,
Mani

Changes in v5:

* Reduced the size of llcc0 to 0x45000 on SDM845 due to overlapping with BWMON
* Added a patch to disable creation of EDAC platform device on SDM845
* Rebase on top of v6.2-rc1
* Moved the EDAC specific patches to the start so that they can be applied
  independently of LLCC patches

Changes in v4:

* Added a patch that fixes the use-after-free bug in qcom_edac driver

Changes in v3:

* Brought back reg-names property for compatibility (Krzysztof)
* Removed Fixes tag and stable list as backporting the drivers/binding/dts
  patches alone would break (Krzysztof)
* Fixed the uninitialized variable issue (Kbot)
* Added a patch to make use of driver supplied polling interval (Luca)
* Added a patch for module autoloading (Andrew)
* Didn't collect Review tags from Sai as the dts patches were changed.

Changes in v2:

* Removed reg-names property and used index of reg property to parse LLCC
  bank base address (Bjorn)
* Collected Ack from Sai for binding
* Added a new patch for polling mode (Luca)
* Renamed subject of patches targeting SC7180 and SM6350
