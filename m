Hey Xu :) Sorry I wasn't more pro-active about communicating what i
was experimenting with! A lot of conversations happened off-the-list
at LPC and LSS so I was playing on the side with the ideas that got
suggested to me. I start to have a little something to share.
Hopefully if we work closer together now we can get quicker results.

I also tried to use this but indeed the "TODO: mess with protection to
set this" in  5437aa788d needs to be addressed before we can use it.

From the conversations I've had at LPC, Steven, Mark, Jiri and Masami
(all in CC) would like to see an ftrace ops based solution (or rather,
something that doesn't require direct calls) for invoking BPF tracing
programs. I figured that the best way to move forward on the question
of whether the performance impact of that would be acceptable or not
is to just build it and measure it. I understand you're testing your
work on real hardware (I work on an emulator at the moment) , would
you be able to compare the impact of my proof of concept branch with
your direct call based approach ?

https://github.com/FlorentRevest/linux/commits/fprobe-min-args

I first tried to implement this as an ftrace op myself but realized I
was re-implementing a lot of the function graph tracer. So I then
tried to use the function graph tracer API but realized I was missing
some features which Steven had addressed in an RFC few years back. So
I rebuilt on that until I realized Masami has been upstreaming the
fprobe and rethook APIs as spiritual successors of Steven's RFC... So
I've now rebuilt yet another proof of concept based on fprobe and
rethook.

That branch is still very much WIP and there are a few things I'd like
to address before sending even an RFC (when kretprobe is built on
rethook for example, I construct pt_regs on the stack in which I copy
the content of ftrace_regs... or program linking/unlinking is racy
right now) but I think it's good enough for performance measurements
already. (fentry_fexit and lsm tests pass)

Note that I integrated this work to my branch too. I extended it to
also have fprobe and rethook save and pass ftrace_regs structures to
their callbacks. Most performance improvements would come from your
arm64/ftrace/per-callsite-ops branch but we'd need to fix the above
TODO for it to work.

Oh, that sucks. Get better Mark!
