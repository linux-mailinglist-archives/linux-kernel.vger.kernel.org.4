I guess on many you don't need to care about lifetime management if you can
assume that certain things never go away. Sometimes these assumptions prove
incorrect, and that's what's happened here.

Thanks for the pointer, this would be nice indeed.

I haven't had time to work on the media device referencing series, overall
it should be good for merging but Hans found an issue I haven't had time to
debug yet. I do intend to continue that in the near future though.
