Pretty sure we don't have the resources to become the CI for
everyone. So testing random trees is not really possible. And 
the alternative of pulling random trees into drm-tip is probably
a not a popular idea either. We used to pull in the sound tree
since it's pretty closely tied to graphics, but I think we
stopped even that because it eneded up pulling the whole of
-rc1 in at random points in time when we were't expecting it.

Ideally each subsystem would have its own CI, or there should
be some kernel wide thing. But I suppose the progress towards
something like that is glacial.

That said, we do test linux-next to some degree. And looks like
at least one of these could have been caught a bit earlier through
that. Unfortunately no one is really keeping an eye on that so
things tend to slip through. Probably need to figure out something
to make better use of that.
