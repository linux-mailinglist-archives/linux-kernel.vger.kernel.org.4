Well, maybe, the linux framework might already put Root Ports in D3 if
the right conditions are satisfied.  I don't understand all of them,
but you can start at pci_dev_check_d3cold() and look at its users and
instrument things to see what actually happens.

But it might be a problem if that has to be synchronized and done in
the right order with respect to the RC things you do here, because I
don't think there's a hook for the PCI core to call your driver to do
the RC stuff.
