There's really no need to even "register" the constructor.  It can
continue to just be passed as needed to the alloc functions.

(Side note, I don't see why klp_shadow_alloc() even needs a constructor
as it's typically used when its corresponding object gets allocated, so
its initialization doesn't need to be atomic.  klp_shadow_get_or_alloc()
on the other hand, does need a constructor since it's used for attaching
to already-existing objects.)

The thing really complicating this whole mess of an API is the
destructor.  The problem is that it can change when replacing
livepatches, so we can't just remember it in the registration.

At least at Red Hat, I don't think we've ever used a shadow destructor.
Its real world use seems somewhere between rare and non-existent.

I guess a destructor would be needed if the constructor (or some other
initialization) allocated additional memory associated with the shadow
variable.  That data would need to be freed.

But in that case couldn't an additional shadow variable be used for the
additional memory?  Then we could just get rid of this idea of the
destructor and this API could become much more straightforward.

Alternatively, each livepatch could just have an optional global
destructor which is called for every object which needs destructing.  It
could then use the ID to decide what needs done (or pass it off to a
more specific destructor).

In that case, at the very least they should be prefixed with underscores
and the function comment should make it clear they shouldn't be called
under normal usage.

Yeah, that does sound better (assuming we decide to keep this type
thing).

Yup, not sure what I was thinking, please ignore...
