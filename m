If I understand correctly, when a cookied task is enqueued, the 
difference delta1 between its vruntime and min_vruntime is very large.

Another task with the same cookie is very actively dequeuing and 
enqueuing, and the difference delta2 between its vruntime and 
min_vruntime is always smaller than delta1?
I'm not sure if this is the case?

I'm not sure if the other way is reasonable, I'm trying to provide a 
function for each scheduling class to find a highest priority non-cookie 
task.

For example fair_sched_class, we can use rq->cfs_tasks to traverse the 
search. But this search may take a long time, maybe we need to limit the 
number of searches.

Hao
