meh - you are 100% right, I'm not sure what we were thinking there ... [ 
actually, I know what we were thinking, but it's a bit complicated - see 
the various non-perfect nomenclature options further below. ]

So the first line of our thinking was that "__" also often & additionally 
means 'lighter weight version of a similar API signature, beware, here be 
dragons, use at your own risk', and more of the focus of these particular 
changes was on identifying hand-coded xchg-ish pieces of code, such as in:

   26ace5d28d36 ("arch/*/uprobes: simplify arch_uretprobe_hijack_return_addr")

... but while that background of '__' is somewhat valid logic that we use 
quite often in various kernel facilities, it doesn't really excuse the 
sloppy decision to slap __ in front of an existing API without trying 
harder, *especially* that a better name with fetch_and_zero() already 
existed :-/

Yeah. So I've rebased locking/core to take out these changes - a simple 
revert is too ugly and the history has no value here really.

Will re-send the rest of locking/core.

Yeah.

So fetch_and_zero() has a bit of a nomenclature & ambiguity problem as 
well: there's already an atomic_fetch_*() API family, and it's easy to 
think that fetch_and_zero() is atomic too - a bit like how xchg() is atomic 
without mentioning 'atomic'.

Adding to the confusion is that there's already atomic APIs that don't use 
atomic_t:

  xchg()
  cmpxchg()
  try_cmpxchg()

... and by *that* implicit nomenclature logic, dropping the atomic_ from a 
atomic_fetch_and_zero() API means: 'atomic API, not using atomic_t'. Which 
fetch_and_zero() clearly isnt ...

So by all that logic and somewhat idiosynchratic API history, the new 
facility should probably not be fetch_and_zero(), but something like 
nonatomic_fetch_and_zero(), but that's quite a mouthful for something so 
simple - and the API family connection to xchg() is lost as well, which is 
a bit sad...

In all that context the least bad approach sounded to add a __ to denote 
__xchg() is 'something special and also lighter weight' (which it is).

I *think* the bigger danger in locking nomenclature is to falsely imply 
atomicity - in that sense I'm not sure fetch_and_zero() is ideal - but I 
can certainly live with it b/c the perfect name keeps eluding me.

Yeah. I do think we might want to keep one related change though:

  e27cff3d2d43 ("arch: rename all internal names __xchg to __arch_xchg")

... not because we want to use the __xchg namespace, but because an _arch 
prefix makes it even *less* likely to be used by non-infrastructure code.

Yeah. We'll try this new facility again in v6.5, but with a better name. 
Sorry about that!

Thanks,
