Update JSON events and metrics for alderlake to perf.

Based on ADL JSON event list v1.16:

https://github.com/intel/perfmon/tree/main/ADL/events

Generate the event list and metrics with the converter scripts:

https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/32

Signed-off-by: Zhengjun Xing <zhengjun.xing@linux.intel.com>
Reviewed-by: Kan Liang <kan.liang@linux.intel.com>

v2:
    * Regenerate the event list and metrics with the new converter scripts.
      (https://github.com/intel/perfmon/pull/32)
    * Update event version for ADL in mapfile.
