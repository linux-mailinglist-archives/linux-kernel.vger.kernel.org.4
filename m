To be precise: 30517,578125ns
What means that the PWM framework can't say "I want 32768Hz",
but just "I want something being very close to 32768Hz".
So what you need is some simple heuristic to interpret the
PWM request -> "PWM requests 30518ns, but supposedly it wants
32768Hz"

NSEC_PER_SEC / 30518 = 32767 (rounded down from 32767,547)
clk_round_rate(channel->clk, 32767) would return 0 (I *think*),
because it tries to find the next lower clock.

The SoC families I'm familiar with have fclkin2 as PWM parent.
That's 1 GHz in my case, what results in a frequency of 32.767,547Hz
for period = 30518n.
What you're saying is that newer generations don't have PWM parents
>24MHz any longer?
