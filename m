Is a list iteration position absolutely required to be a local variable,
or can it be a dereferenced pointer ?

Let's say we take "list_for_each()" as example:

#define list_for_each(pos, head) \
         for (pos = (head)->next; !list_is_head(pos, head); pos = pos->next)

and turn "pos" into "POS" to make it clearer that it is used as an lvalue:

#define list_for_each(POS, head) \
         for (POS = (head)->next; !list_is_head(POS, head); pos = POS->next)

The following usage pattern is still broken:

struct list_head list;

void f(struct list_head **ppos)
{
   list_for_each(*ppos, &list) {
     //...
   }
}

Because ->next has higher operator precedence than "*", which is unexpected.

I would argue that even if we choose to capitalize the macro special arguments used
as lvalues and as member names so they stand out, it does not eliminate the need to
be careful about proper use of parentheses around those parameters when they are also
used as rvalues.

Thanks,

Mathieu
