Our continuous integration relies on TuxSuite [1], which in turn
requires access to their service. TuxMake [2] is the backend for
TuxSuite, which is what I use doing a lot of my build testing. It can
use your local toolchains or it can use Docker/Podman to build in their
curated containers, which have a wide variety of versions, if that
matters to you.

I have thought about writing a wrapper around tuxmake to build our
TuxSuite configurations (the tuxsuite/ folder within our repo) locally,
maybe this is time to do so :) it would be useful to have something like

  $ scripts/build-local.py tuxsuite/tip-clang-15.yml tuxsuite/tip-clang-16.yml

which would allow people to easily test the configurations that we
generally care about for -tip with recent/stable versions of clang/LLVM.
Otherwise, a simple

  $ tuxmake -a x86_64 -k allmodconfig -t llvm default

or

  $ make -skj"$(nproc)" ARCH=x86_64 LLVM=1 allmodconfig all

is generally good enough to catch the majority of problems visible with
clang, assuming your distribution has a version of LLVM that the kernel
supports (11.x+).
