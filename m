Sigh, that's a bug. Now I see where the confusion is coming from.

Annoyingly it's basically the exact thing I called out in 951d48855d86 
when making dma-ranges work for non-OF PCI devices in the first place, 
but apparently neither I nor anyone else thought of this particular edge 
case at the time. Sorry about that. I'll have a look at how best to fix it.

Everything else still stands, though. If you can't use the original 
platform device for DMA API calls, at least configure the child device 
properly by calling of_dma_configure() with the parent's DT node in the 
expected manner (and manually remove its dma_range_map if you need an 
immediate workaround).

Thanks,
Robin.
