Sure, I will do that. link_trained = !(link_status & PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_LT); within
the do-while loop and checking for it to be true in the loop as well as below.

While I agree that I could have performed the entire Link Training check only if
the Gen2 Link Retraining Quirk is set for the RC, considering that the
completion of the Link Training is a necessity irrespective of whether or not
the Quirk exists, I preferred to add the check unconditionally. I would like to
point out that the race condition responsible for the crash is the following:
Without the completion of the Physical Layer link training, the call to the
cdns_pci_map_bus() function in order to access the End Point's registers (if an
EP device is connected) results in the crash. This is primarily observed only on
RT Linux where the software call to cdns_pci_map_bus() by PCI subsystem occurs
quite fast, before the Physical Layer link training is complete. For this
reason, irrespective of whether the Physical Layer link training occurs only
once because of the default flow or occurs a second time due to the Gen2 Link
Retraining Quirk, it appears to me that the crash could potentially occur in
both cases if we don't wait for the Physical Layer link training to complete.

Please let me know if this sounds acceptable. If not, I will check if the quirk
is set before proceeding to verify link training completion and implement this
in the v4 patch.
