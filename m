This is expected, because the test didn't start any fault resolving thread,
so the write will block until someone unprotects the page.

But it shouldn't happen to your use case if you applied both WP_UNPOPULATED
& WP_ASYNC.

Could you try "cat /proc/$PID/stack" to see where does your thread stuck
at?
