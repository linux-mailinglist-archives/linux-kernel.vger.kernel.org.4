This assumes a specific use of {un}pin_user_page*, right? IIUC the
cgroup charging is meant to be used from vm_account but that doesn't
really tell anything about the lifetime nor the ownership. Maybe this is
just a matter of documentation update...

Wouldn't you get an unbalanced charges then? How can admin recover that
situation?

OK, I see. This makes it really much more complicated then.

arguably rlimit has a concept of the owner at least AFAICS. I do realize
this is not really great wrt a high level resource control though.

The problem I can see is that the fd is just too fluid for tracking. You
can pass fd over to a different cgroup context and then all the tracking
just loses any trail to an owner.

I can see how the underlying memcg tracking information is not really
feasible for your usecases but I am really worried that it is just too
easy to misaccount without any other proper ownership tracking.
