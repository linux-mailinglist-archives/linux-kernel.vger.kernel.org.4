So, I'm going to call shenanigans here.

You say:

	The caller needs to guarantee this.

Then, you go and tell us how the *ONE* caller of this function doesn't
actually guarantee this.  Plus, you *KNOW* this.

Those are shenanigans.

Let's do something like this instead of asking for something impossible
and pretending that the callers are going to provide some fantasy solution.

/*
 * Attempt to configure the global KeyID on all physical packages.
 *
 * This requires running code on at least one CPU in each package.  If a
 * package has no online CPUs, that code will not run and TDX module
 * initialization (TDH.whatever) will fail.
 *
 * This code takes no affirmative steps to online CPUs.  Callers (aka.
 * KVM) can ensure success by ensuring sufficient CPUs are online for
 * this to succeed.
 */

Now, since this _is_ all imperfect, what will our users see if this
house of cards falls down?  Will they get a nice error message like:

     TDX: failed to configure module, no online CPUs in package 12

Or, will they see:

     TDX: Hurr, durr, I'm confused and you should be too

?
