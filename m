Not in this shape of BPF namespace as done in this patch set.
We've talked about BPF namespace in the past. This is not it.

I disagree that allowing admin to run bpftool without sudo is a task
worth solving. The visibility of bpf progs in a container is a different task.
Without doing any kernel changes we can add a flag to bpftool to let
'bpftool prog show' list progs that were loaded by processes in the same cgroup.
bpftool already does prog->pid mapping with bpf iterators.
It can filter by cgroup just as well.
