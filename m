Sure, the controlling function should (and does in mlx5) drive
everything here.

What the kernel is doing is providing the abstraction to link the
controlling function to the VFIO device in a general way.

We don't want to just punt this problem to user space and say 'good
luck finding the right cdev for migration control'. If the kernel
struggles to link them then userspace will not fare better on its own.

Especially, we do not want every VFIO device to have its own crazy way
for userspace to link the controlling/controlled functions
together. This is something the kernel has to abstract away.

So, IMHO, we must assume the kernel is aware of the relationship,
whatever algorithm it uses to become aware.

It just means the issue is doing the necessary cross-subsystem
locking.

That combined with the fact they really are two halfs of the same
thing - operations on the controlling function have to be sequenced
with operations on the VFIO device - makes me prefer the single uAPI.

We have spend some time looking at this for mlx5. It is a hard
problem. The VFIO driver cannot operate the device, eg it cannot do
MMIO and things, so it is limited to items in the PCI config space to
figure out the device identity.

Yes, that is part of the current mlx5 model. It is not inherent to the
device design, but the problems with arbitary nesting were hard enough
they were not tackled at this point.
