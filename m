Great!

So IIUC all the issues are fixed. I left some comments, but I think
you can start sending the virtio/vhost preparation patches to net-next
(when it will re-open).

I just pointend out something to fix, and that maybe we can merge
the first 2 patches.

I think you can restart with v0, describing in the cover letter that
the patches was part of this RFC.

Thanks,
Stefano
