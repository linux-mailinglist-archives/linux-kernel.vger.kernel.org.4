I don't think GetMemoryMap() is intended as a way to tell the OS about
device memory.  The OS needs to know what address space goes with what
device and what kind of device it is.  The ACPI namespace supplies all
that kind of information, so it doesn't make sense to me that we'd get
some from ACPI and some from EFI.

Also, the EFI spec says EfiReservedMemoryType is "Not usable."  But if
ECAM space were described that way, obviously the OS *does* need to
use it, so it doesn't really seem to fit.

I do think the EFI spec is pretty poorly worded.  EfiMemoryMappedIO is
"not used by the OS" -- misleading, since the OS *has* to use ECAM and
host bridge apertures.  And "all system memory-mapped IO information
should come from ACPI tables" -- well, the EfiMemoryMappedIO region is
itself certainly some kind of information about memory-mapped IO
space!  I think it should really refer to the ACPI *namespace*
specifically, not just tables that might include MCFG, etc.  IMHO the
static tables like MCFG are basically just a crutch for use before we
know how to parse the namespace.

Anyway, I am inclined to do nothing with EFI_RESERVED_TYPE unless we
come across a system that needs it.
