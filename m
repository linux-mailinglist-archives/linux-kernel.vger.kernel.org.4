Heh, it's definitely optional.

Ah, yeah, that's better.

I don't think "pcpu" belongs in kvm_vcpu, even in the long run.  The vast, vast
majority of tests will never care about pinning, which means that vcpu->pcpu can't
be used for anything except the actual pinning.   And for pinning, the "pcpu"
doesn't need to be persistent information, i.e. doesn't need to live in kvm_vcpu.

> Probably we also don't need "bool pin_vcpus".

Yeah, but for selftests shaving bytes is not exactly top priority, and having a
dedicated flag avoids the need for magic numbers.  If Vipin had used -1, I'd
probably be fine with that, but I'm also totally fine using a dedicated flag too.

The big downside of this is forcing all callers of perf_test_create_vm() to pass
in NULL.  I really want to move away from this pattern as it makes what should be
simple code rather difficult to read due to having a bunch of "dead" params
dangling off the end of function calls.
