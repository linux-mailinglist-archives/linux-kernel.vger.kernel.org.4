Strictly speaking, the protected pKVM guest does need some I/O beyond
that, e.g. for some (limited and specialized) communication between the
host and the guest, e.g. vsock-based. For example, in the fingerprint
use case, the guest receives requests from the host to capture
fingerprint data from the sensor, sends encrypted fingerprint templates
to the host, and so on.

Additionally, speaking of the hardware device, the guest does not
entirely own it. It has direct exclusive access to the data
communication with the device (ensured by its exclusive access to MMIO
and DMA buffers), but e.g. the device interrupts are forwarded to the
guest by the host, and the PCI config space is virtualized by the host.

But I think I get what you mean: there is no data transfer whereby the
host is not an endpoint but an intermediary between the guest and some
device. In simple words, things like virtio-net or virtio-blk are out of
scope. Yes, I think that's correct for pKVM-on-x86 use cases (and I
suppose it is correct for pKVM-on-ARM use cases as well). I guess it
means that "guest data attacks" may not be relevant to pKVM, and perhaps
this makes its threat model substantially different from cloud use
cases.

However, other kinds of threats described in the doc do seem to be
relevant to pKVM. "Malformed/malicious runtime input" is relevant since
communication channels between the host and the guest do exist, the host
may arbitrarily inject interrupts into the guest, etc. "Guest malicious
configuration" is relevant too, and guest attestation is required, as I
wrote in [1].

Cc'ing android-kvm and some ChromeOS folks to correct me if needed.

Agree, and I don't think it makes sense to mention pKVM-on-x86 without
mentioning pKVM-on-ARM, as if pKVM-on-x86 had more in common with cloud
use cases than with pKVM-on-ARM, while quite the opposite is true.

It seems there is no reason why pKVM-on-x86 threat model should be
different from pKVM-on-ARM. The use cases on ARM (for Android) and on
x86 (for ChromeOS) are somewhat different at this moment (in that in
ChromeOS use cases the protected guest's sensitive data includes also
data coming directly from a physical device), but IIUC they are
converging now, i.e. Android is getting interested in use cases with
physical devices too.

Again, pedantic mode on, I find it difficult to agree with the wording
that the guest owns "most of" the HW resources it uses. It controls the
data communication with its hardware device, but other resources (e.g.
CPU time, interrupts, timers, PCI config space, ACPI) are owned by the
host and virtualized by it for the guest.
