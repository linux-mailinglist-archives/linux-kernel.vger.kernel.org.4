I tried several approaches but all of them ended up having slightly
different code pathes and decided to keep everything the same from
legacy arch over global MSI and the modern per device MSI models.

Due to that some of the constructs are slightly awkward, but the
important outcome for me was that I ended up with as many shared code
pathes as possible. Having separate code pathes for all variants is for
one causing code bloat and what's worse it's a guarantee for divergance
and maintenance nightmares. As this is setup/teardown management code
and not the fancy hotpath where we really want to spare cycles, I went
for the unified model.

I don't see an issue with that.

  id = msi_create_device_domain(dev, &template, ...);
  
is not much different from:

  ptr = msi_create_device_domain(dev, &template, ...);

But it makes a massive difference vs. encapsulation and pointer leakage.

If you have a stale ID then you can't do harm, a stale pointer very much
so.

Aside of that once pointers are available people insist on fiddling in
the guts. As I'm mopping up behind driver writers for the last twenty
years now, my confidence in them is pretty close to zero.

So I rather be defensive and work towards encapsulation where ever its
possible. Interrupts are a source of hard to debug subtle bugs, so
taking the tinkerers the tools away to cause them is a good thing IMO.

Thanks,
