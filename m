Full-caps DSC in the title, as discussed previously.

On that note, don't forget to CC those who have reviewed your patches
previously, as also brought up in earlier review.

Some typo nits:

DSC* active bits.

s/are set/are written/ (the variable is set, registers are written).

Drop `the` before `cfg->dsc` (and you could replace `s/is set/is
non-zero/).

If you have validated that it is fine to write these registers on
_every_ platform supported by DPU1, and after fixing the above nits and
the Fixes: commit hash as pointed out by Abhinav:

Does this flush all DSCs programmed in CTL_DSC_FLUSH as set above?  That
is currently still in `if (cfg->dsc)` and never overwritten if all DSCs
are disabled, should it be taken out of the `if` to make sure no DSCs
are inadvertently flushed, or otherwise cache the "previous mask" to
make sure we flush exactly the right DSC blocks?

Thanks!
