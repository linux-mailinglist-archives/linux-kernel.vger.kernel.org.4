It would be great to have all this motivation for the new feature
documented in shadow-vars.rst.

If downgrades are going to be commonplace then I agree my automatic
detection idea wouldn't work so well.  And ref counting does make sense.

However I'm still not convinced that per-object is the way to go.
Doesn't that create more room for human error?  There's no way to
detect-and-warn if the wrong object is used, or if the variable is used
by multiple objects but only one of them is listed.

Per-patch shadow variable types would be easy to detect and warn on
misuse.  And easy to automate in patch author tooling.

Also, I'm not crazy about the new API.  It's even more confusing than
before.
