That's actually my point.  I think this problem probably affects
non-USB devices, non-xHCI devices, non-USB4 routers, etc.

If we can say "Any device below a Root Port in D3hot/D3cold may not
support wakeup if X, Y, Z.  Root Ports may be put in D3hot/D3cold for
sleep/hibernate/s2idle/...",  that's much more actionable.

So that must mean something other than the Root Port has to be in some
specific state.  "System in s2idle" is not actionable in terms of PCI
maintenance.  It sounds like we just haven't really gotten to the root
cause yet.

What's the connection to wakeup?

I'm really looking hard for that spec citation :)  Without that, this
just devolves into "this seems to work on these systems."
