This is the most important question: Why are times spent in various
states and transition counts important?  Is this some kind of
predictive failure system, or is it simply logging? If it's logging,
wouldn't you get better information if we output state changes as they
occur then they'd appear as timestamped entries in the syslog from
which all these statistics could be deduced?

I don't think that's a requirement.  The whole point of sysfs is it's
user readable, so we don't need a tool to make use of its entries.  On
the other hand if this tool can help elucidate the use case for these
statistics, then publishing it now would be useful to help everyone
else understand why this is useful.
