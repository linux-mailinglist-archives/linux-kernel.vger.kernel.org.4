If you're asking whether "depends on ARM" can be removed for
PCI_MVEBU, I don't know the answer.  I do see that CONFIG_ARCH_MVEBU
is mentioned in arch/arm64, which doesn't seem to set CONFIG_ARM.

In any event, I would consider a change like that to be a separate
patch.  Here I just want to focus on CONFIG_OF.
