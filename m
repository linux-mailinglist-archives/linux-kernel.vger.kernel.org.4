This includes several Synopsys DesignWare eDMA controller driver changes
that are in drivers/dma, not drivers/pci.  These lead up to eDMA support in
PCIe Root Port and Endpoint drivers and have been acked by Vinod.

The following changes since commit 1b929c02afd37871d5afb9d498426f83432e71c2:

  Linux 6.2-rc1 (2022-12-25 13:41:39 -0800)

are available in the Git repository at:

  Merge branch 'pci/misc' (2023-02-22 13:47:32 -0600)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Enumeration:

  - Rework portdrv shutdown so it disables interrupts but doesn't disable
    bus mastering, which leads to hangs on Loongson LS7A.

  - Add mechanism to prevent Max_Read_Request_Size (MRRS) increases, again
    to avoid hardware issues on Loongson LS7A (and likely other devices
    based on DesignWare IP).

  - Ignore devices with a firmware (DT or ACPI) node that says the device
    is disabled.

Resource management:

  - Distribute spare resources to unconfigured hotplug bridges at boot-time
    (not just when hot-adding such a bridge), which makes hot-adding
    devices to docks work better.  Tried this in v6.1 but had to revert for 
    regressions, so try again.

  - Fix root bus issue that dropped resources that happened to end at 0,
    e.g., [bus 00].

PCI device hotplug:

  - Remove device locking when marking device as disconnected so this
    doesn't have to wait for concurrent driver bind/unbind to complete.

  - Quirk more Qualcomm bridges that don't fully implement the PCIe Slot
    Status 'Command Completed' bit.

Power management:

  - Account for _S0W of the target bridge in acpi_pci_bridge_d3() so we
    don't miss hot-add notifications for USB4 docks, Thunderbolt, etc.

Reset:

  - Observe delay after reset, e.g., resuming from system sleep, regardless
    of whether a bridge can suspend to D3cold at runtime.

  - Wait for secondary bus to become ready after a bridge reset.

Virtualization:

  - Avoid FLR on some AMD FCH AHCI adapters where it doesn't work.

  - Allow independent IOMMU groups for some Wangxun NICs that prevent
    peer-to-peer transactions but don't advertise an ACS Capability.

Error handling:

  - Configure End-to-End-CRC (ECRC) only if Linux owns the AER Capability.

  - Remove redundant Device Control Error Reporting Enable in the AER
    service driver since this is already done for all devices during
    enumeration.

ASPM:

  - Add pci_enable_link_state() interface to allow drivers to enable ASPM
    link state.

Endpoint framework:

  - Move dra7xx and tegra194 linkup processing from hard IRQ to threaded
    IRQ handler.

  - Add a separate lock for endpoint controller list of endpoint function
    drivers to prevent deadlock in callbacks.

  - Pass events from endpoint controller to endpoint function drivers via
    callbacks instead of notifiers.

Synopsys DesignWare eDMA controller driver (acked by Vinod):

  - Fix CPU vs PCI address issues.

  - Fix source vs destination address issues.

  - Fix issues with interleaved transfer semantics.

  - Fix channel count initialization issue (issue still exists in several
    other drivers).

  - Clean up and improve debugfs usage so it will work on platforms with
    several eDMA devices.

Baikal T-1 PCIe controller driver:

  - Set a 64-bit DMA mask.

Freescale i.MX6 PCIe controller driver:

  - Add i.MX8MM, i.MX8MQ, i.MX8MP endpoint mode DT binding and driver
    support.

Intel VMD host bridge driver:

  - Add quirk to configure PCIe ASPM and LTR.  This is normally done by
    BIOS, and will be for future products.

Marvell MVEBU PCIe controller driver:

  - Mark this driver as broken in Kconfig since bugs prevent its daily
    usage.

MediaTek MT7621 PCIe controller driver:

  - Delay PHY port initialization to improve boot reliability for ZBT
    WE1326, ZBT WF3526-P, and some Netgear models.

Qualcomm PCIe controller driver:

  - Add MSM8998 DT compatible string.

  - Unify MSM8996 and MSM8998 clock orderings.

  - Add SM8350 DT binding and driver support.

  - Add IPQ8074 Gen3 DT binding and driver support.

  - Correct qcom,perst-regs in DT binding.

  - Add qcom_pcie_host_deinit() so the PHY is powered off and regulators
    and clocks are disabled on late host-init errors.

Socionext UniPhier Pro5 controller driver:

  - Clean up uniphier-ep reg, clocks, resets, and their names in DT
    binding.

Synopsys DesignWare PCIe controller driver:

  - Restrict coherent DMA mask to 32 bits for MSI, but allow controller
    drivers to set 64-bit streaming DMA mask.

  - Add eDMA engine support in both Root Port and Endpoint controllers.

Miscellaneous:

  - Remove MODULE_LICENSE from boolean drivers so they don't look like
    modules so modprobe can complain about them.
