I agree that can be a problem, it depends on the specific workload and
configuration. The continuous lock contention at each CPU boundary
causes a regression (see my reply to Waiman), but I am not sure if
it's worse than the scenario you are describing.

Concurrent flushing can be a problem for some workloads, especially in
the MM code we flush in the reclaim and refault paths. This is
currently mitigated by only allowing one flusher at a time from the
memcg side, but contention can still happen with flushing when a
cgroup is being freed or other flushers in other subsystems.

I tried allowing concurrent flushing by completely removing the global
rstat lock, and only depending on the percpu locks for
synchronization. For this to be correct the global stat counters need
to be atomic, this introduced a slow down for flushing in general. I
also noticed heavier lock contention on the percpu locks, since all
flushers try to acquire all locks in the same order. I even tried
implementing a simple retry scheme where we try to acquire the percpu
lock, and if we fail we queue the current cpu and move to the next
one. This ended up causing a little bit of slowness as well. Together
with the slowness introduced by atomic operations it seemed like a
significant regression in the simple flushing path.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for modifying the current approach, I
just want to make sure we are making the correct decision for *most*
workloads. Keep in mind that this series aims to minimize the number
of flushers from atomic contexts as well, and for non-atomic flushers
we allow giving up the lock at CPU boundaries anyway. The current
approach only keeps the lock held throughout for atomic flushers.

Any ideas here are welcome!
