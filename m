I never said the PV interfaces should be defined by KVM.  I 100% agree that any
one hypervisor defining its own interface will suffer the same problem.

I think having a PV interface for coordinating mitigations between host and guest
is a great idea.  What I don't like is tying the interface to "hardware" and defining
the interface without even trying to collaborate with others.

Well yeah, because the interface was designed only to work for Intel CPUs.

I'll take that bet.  The vast majority of problems that are solved by PV interfaces
are common to all architectures and vendors, e.g. steal time, PV spinlocks, async
page faults, directed yield, confidential VMs (GHCB vs. GHCI), etc.  I highly doubt
Intel is the only hardware vendor that will ever benefit from paravirtualizing
mitigations.
