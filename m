Thanks for the explanation!

I thought the mmap_sem said was "&EXT4_I(inode)->i_mmap_sem".

But here are some more questions:

1) In the arch code page fault is handled by mmap_read_lock(mm) to get the
 Â Â  shared lock, why would this lead to ABBA deadlock?

2) Why would page fault be triggered in the write process?

Could you explain it in more detail?
