Hmm.  Bringing switches into the TCB came up at Plumbers.
You can get partly around that using selective IDE (end to end encryption)
but it has some disadvantages.

You can attest the switches if you don't mind bringing them into TCB
(one particularly cloud vendor person was very strongly against doing so!)
but they don't have nice VF type abstractions so the switch attestation
needs to go through someone who isn't the guest.

FYI: We have QEMU using the DMTF reference implementation (libspdm/spdm-emu)
if anyone wants to play with it.  Avery Design folk did the qemu bridging to that
a while back. Not upstream yet*, but I'm carrying it on my staging CXL qemu tree.

https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/commit/8d0ad6bc84a5d96039aaf8f929c60b9f7ba02832

In combination with Lucas' tree mentioned earlier you can get all the handshaking
to happen to attest against certs. Don't think we are yet actually checking the
IDs but trivial to add (mainly a case of generating right certs with the
Subject Alternative Name set).

Jonathan

* It's a hack using the socket interface of spdm-emu tools - at some point I need
to start a discussion on QEMU list / with dmtf tools group on whether to fix
libspdm to actually work as a shared library, or cope with the current approach
(crossing fingers the socket interface remains stable in spdm-emu).
