Then what is that all for?

The VINVALL at the point a VPE is mapped serves a purpose: to
invalidate the caches from a previous instance of a VPE with the same
VPEID. It's not for "robustness" but for *correctness*.

May I suggest that in the future, you post patches that actually serve
a real purpose and avoid wasting people's time? Your company employs a
bunch of good people, some of which are pretty knowledgeable when it
comes to the GIC. Please consult with them before posting such thing.

Thanks,
