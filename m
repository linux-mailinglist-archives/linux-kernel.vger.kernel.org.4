I am right. Appropriate DMA API usage as defined by the DMA API 
maintainers is not a matter of supposition. I literally just explained 
right there why drivers can't blindly assume the default mask is usable 
on modern systems (yes, it was different 20 years ago when system 
topologies were simpler).

However, having now gone and looked at the whole driver rather than 
unclear fragments of patch context, the code here *is* technically 
wrong. I've been mistakenly thinking all along that this was operating 
on the PCI device because I know that's what it *should* be doing, and 
seeing misleading things like "dev = pci->dev" falsely affirmed that 
assumption that it would be correct because it's been around for ages. 
AFAIU the correct PCI device won't actually exist until we've got far 
enough through pci_host_probe(), so I'm not sure how to easily solve this :/

Of course *this* patch doesn't change any of that either, so it's no 
worse than the existing code and I don't see that dropping it helps you 
at all; the current driver is already trampling your 64-bit mask back to 
32 bits and reserving the doorbell address in the wrong DMA address 
space (modulo the other dma-ranges bug which also took far too long to 
figure out). At this point I'd rather keep it since getting rid of the 
__GFP_DMA32 abuse is objectively good. If losing one page of coherent 
memory is a measurably significant problem for T1 once the other issues 
are worked out and that series lands, then you're welcome to propose a 
change on top (but I would prefer that all the drivers using this trick 
are changed consistently).

Thanks,
Robin.
