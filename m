I could use the ORC data I generate by using the decoder against the SFrame data.
A function is reliable only if both data sources agree for the whole function.

Also, in my approach, the actual frame pointer is dynamically checked against the
frame pointer computed from the unwind data. Any mismatch indicates an unreliable stack trace.

IMHO, this is sufficient to provide livepatch. Do you agree?
