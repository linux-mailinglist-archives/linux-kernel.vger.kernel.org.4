Hi Shuai:

I'm very happy to have received your response, we encountered this 
problem in our production environment too. I spent a lot of time 
researching the rationale for synchronous errors and asynchronous errors 
to share the same process. I mention in my patch commit message: 
memory_failure() triggered by synchronous error is
executed in the kworker context, the early_kill mode of memory_failure() 

will send wrong si_code by SIGBUS signal because of wrong current process.

The challenge for my patch is to prove the rationality of distinguishing 
synchronous errors. I do not have a good idea of distinguishing 
synchronous error by looking through ACPI/UEFI spec, so I sent this 
patchset for more input. And I resent RFC PATCH v1 [1]add this as TODO.

Yes, as I mentioned above, I do not have a good idea of distinguishing 
synchronous error. I agree with you that ghes_proc_in_irq() is called in 
SDEI, SEA, NMI notify type, they are NMI-like notify, this function run 
some job which may not be NMI safe in IRQ context. And NMI may be 
asynchronous error.

However, cureent kernel use ghes_kick_task_work in ghes_proc_in_irq(), 
there is an assumption here that ghes_proc_in_irq() are currently in the 
context of a synchronous exception, although this is not appropriate.

I'm glad your team is working on advancing this thing in the UEFI 
community. This will make kernel identify synchronous as an easy job. 
Based on your proposal, I think your work is suitable.

However, there are real problems here in the running production 
environment of the LTS kernel:
1. this new proposal has not yet been accepted by the UEFI spec
2. it will require firmware update in production environment which may 
be more difficult than kernel livepatch upgrade.

If there are more ways to distinguish synchronous error in kernel APEI,
I can try it. For example, in APEI mode, is it suitable to use notify 
type to distinguish synchronous error?
synchronous error:
SDEI SEA
asynchronous error:
NMI
