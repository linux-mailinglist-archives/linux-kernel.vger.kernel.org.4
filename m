Heh, by that definition, anything and everything is "technically wrong".  A=
n Intel
CPU might support SVM, even though we know no such CPUs exist, so requiring=
 AMD or
Hygon to enable SVM is technically wrong.

If A/D bits are enabled, both EPT and 64-bit NPT support the Accessed bit a=
t all
levels irrespective of whether or not the entry maps a huge page.

PAE NPT is a different story, but the TDP MMU is limited to 64-bit kernels,=
 i.e.
requires 64-bit NPT.
