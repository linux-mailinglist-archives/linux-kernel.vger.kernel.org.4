The big problem here is that while we can detect those PMUs late, we only
register them with the core perf code in arm_pmu_acpi_probe(), so even if we
detect PMUs after that, those PMUs won't become usable.

I don't think we can support the case where none of the CPUs associated with a
PMU are booted at startup unless we make more substantial changes to the way we
register the PMUs with perf (and that would be going firther than what we
support with DT).

We can support bringing those CPUs online, just not registering them with perf.

Ah, sorry, I missed that returning an error here would completely halt bringing
the CPU online. We arm_pmu_acpi_cpu_starting() to return 0 rather than -ENOENT
when it doesn't find a matching PMU, which would permit the CPU to come online.

I've made that change (and pushed that out to the branch), and it seems to work
for me, testing in a UEFI+ACPI VM on a ThunderX2, with the arm_pmu_acpi code
hacked to use the cpu index (rather than the MIDR) as the identifier for the
type of CPU.

With that change, booting a 64-vCPU VM with 'maxcpus=8', I see each of the
boot-time CPUs had its PMU registered:

| # ls /sys/bus/event_source/devices/
| armv8_pmuv3_0  armv8_pmuv3_3  armv8_pmuv3_6  software
| armv8_pmuv3_1  armv8_pmuv3_4  armv8_pmuv3_7  tracepoint
| armv8_pmuv3_2  armv8_pmuv3_5  breakpoint

... and if I try to online a non-matching CPU the CPU will come up, but I get a
notification that we couldn't associate with a PMU:

| # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu8/online
| Detected PIPT I-cache on CPU8
| GICv3: CPU8: found redistributor 8 region 0:0x00000000081a0000
| GICv3: CPU8: using allocated LPI pending table @0x0000000040290000
| Unable to associate CPU8 with a PMU
| CPU8: Booted secondary processor 0x0000000008 [0x431f0af1]

If I do the same thing but without the MIDR hack, it also seems to work:

| # ls /sys/bus/event_source/devices/
| armv8_pmuv3_0  breakpoint     software       tracepoint
| # cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/armv8_pmuv3_0/cpus 
| 0-7
| # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu10/online 
| Detected PIPT I-cache on CPU10
| GICv3: CPU10: found redistributor a region 0:0x00000000081e0000
| GICv3: CPU10: using allocated LPI pending table @0x00000000402b0000
| CPU10: Booted secondary processor 0x000000000a [0x431f0af1]
| # ls /sys/bus/event_source/devices/
| armv8_pmuv3_0  breakpoint     software       tracepoint
| # cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/armv8_pmuv3_0/cpus 
| 0-7,10

... so I think that should be ok?

Thanks,
Mark.
