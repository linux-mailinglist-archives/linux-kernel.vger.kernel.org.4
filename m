We know there were bugs in older server implementations, so the question is whether this might be a problem with handling a bad/corrupt RPC reply from the server, or whether it is happening against code that is supposed to have been fixed?

No, server is Rpi3, client is Odroid HC1.

No specific workload - mounting system with nfsroot. You have there full
logs as it is reproducible every time.

I'll check.

exports are the same since like 5 years or more:

/srv/nfs/odroidhc1	192.168.1.0/24(rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
/srv/nfs/odroidhc1-home
192.168.1.0/24(rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
