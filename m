Hi Paolo,

I think this idea is great!

On our side, we 've been working on providing ways to let VMs (kernel 
and user space)
know that they have been cloned/snapshotted/restored from snapshots[1].

This is tightly coupled with PRNGs both in kernel and user space and 
there needs to be some
collaboration with random.c to tie everything together [2][3]. It sounds 
like it could be a good
fit for this MC (?).

It would be interested to figure out whether such notifications would be 
interested to other
parts of the kernel as well.

Cheers,
Babis
