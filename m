Well, sys_getrandom() will just do:

	if (unlikely(crng->generation != READ_ONCE(base_crng.generation)))

So I think you do need ordering between base_crng.generation and
_vdso_rng_data.generation.  If _vdso_rng_data.generation is changed, the change
in base_crng.generation needs to be visible too.

It's undefined behavior for C code to be working on values that can be mutated
underneath it, though, unless they are volatile.  Granted, people still do this
all the time, but I'd hope we can be a bit more careful here...

That is a separate problem though, right?  It does *not* mean that the
vgetrandom_state can be zeroed out from underneath __cvdso_getrandom_data().
