Just to keep the info easily available: the protected structure (struct
memcg_stock_pcp) fits in 48 Bytes, which is less than the usual 64B cacheli=
ne.=20

struct memcg_stock_pcp {
	spinlock_t                 stock_lock;           /*     0     4 */
	unsigned int               nr_pages;             /*     4     4 */
	struct mem_cgroup *        cached;               /*     8     8 */
	struct obj_cgroup *        cached_objcg;         /*    16     8 */
	struct pglist_data *       cached_pgdat;         /*    24     8 */
	unsigned int               nr_bytes;             /*    32     4 */
	int                        nr_slab_reclaimable_b; /*    36     4 */
	int                        nr_slab_unreclaimable_b; /*    40     4 */

	/* size: 48, cachelines: 1, members: 8 */
	/* padding: 4 */
	/* last cacheline: 48 bytes */
};

(It got smaller after patches 3/5, 4/5 and 5/5, which remove holes, work_st=
ruct
and flags respectively.)

On top of that, patch 1/5 makes sure the percpu allocation is aligned to
cacheline size.
