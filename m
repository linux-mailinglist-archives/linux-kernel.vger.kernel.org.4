Not sure if this matters. If you run a kernel, which is not aware
of IMA, it's your choice. I don't undestand why here is so important
to protect user from doing illogical decisions.

If you want non-IMA kernels to support IMA, CONFIG_IMA should not
probably even exist because you are essentially saying that any
kernel play well with IMA.
