I have enabled the IRQs and messages thanks to your patches but I don't get
messages from the IRQs (it seems no IRQs are fired). My PCIe link seems sta=
ble.
The main issue I face is still that after a random amount of time, the BARs=
 are
reset to 0, I don't have a PCIe analyzer so I cannot chase config space TLP=
s
(e.g., host writing the BAR values to the config header), but I don't think=
 that
the problem comes from a TLP issued from the host. (it might be).

I don't think it's a buffer overflow / out-of-bounds access by kernel
code for two reasons
1) The values in the config space around the BARs is coherent and unchanged
2) The bars are reset to 0 and not a random value

I suspect a hardware reset of those registers issued internally in the
PCIe controller,
I don't know why (it might be a link related event or power state
related event).

I have also experienced very slow behavior with the PCI endpoint test drive=
r,
e.g., pcitest -w 1024 -d would take tens of seconds to complete. It seems t=
o
come from LCRC errors, when I check the "LCRC Error count register"
@0xFD90'0214 I can see it drastically increase between two calls of pcitest
(when I mean drastically it means by 6607 (0x19CF) for example).

The "ECC Correctable Error Count Register" @0xFD90'0218 reads 0 though.

I have tried to shorten the cabling by removing one of the PCIe extenders, =
that
didn't change the issues much.

Any ideas as to why I see a large number of TLPs with LCRC errors in them ?
Do you experience the same ? What are your values in 0xFD90'0214 when
running e.g., pcitest -w 1024 -d (note: you can reset the counter by writin=
g
0xFFFF to it in case it reaches the maximum value of 0xFFFF).
