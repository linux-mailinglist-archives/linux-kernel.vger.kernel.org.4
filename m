Dear Linux Kernel Community,

I hope this message finds you well.

I'd like to use crash utility for postmortem of my kernel coredump 
analysis.

I was able to collect coredump and able to use various operation from 
within the crash utility such as irq -s,Â  log, files and others.

I am using: crash-arm64 version: 7.3.0, gdb version: 7.6, kernel version 
4.19.

My specific interest lies in debugging drivers internal state, e.g. 
platform drivers.

For some hands-on experience with crash utility I'd like to start by 
iterating over all the platform drivers and print their names,

However, I am finding it challenging to get started with this process 
and I am uncertain of the best approach to achieve this. I have scoured 
various resources for insights, but the information related to this 
specific usage seems to be scattered and not exhaustive.

Given the collective expertise on this mailing list, I thought it would 
be the best place to seek guidance. Specifically, I would appreciate it 
if you could provide:

Any relevant documentation, guides, or tutorials to debug platform 
drivers using the crash utility for kernel coredump analysis.
Some simple examples of using the crash utility to debug platform 
drivers, if possible.
Any important points or common pitfalls to keep in mind while performing 
this kind of analysis.
Any other tips, best practices, or recommendations to effectively debug 
platform drivers using the crash utility would also be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Talel, Shenhar.
