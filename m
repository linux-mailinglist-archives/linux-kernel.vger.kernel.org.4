With the current approach implemented in this patch, I could do the following:
In the cdns_pcie_host_wait_for_link() function, I obtain the reference to the
struct cdns_pcie_rc *rc, using:
struct cdns_pcie_rc *rc = container_of(pcie, struct cdns_pcie_rc, pcie);
followed by checking if the quirk "quirk_retrain_flag" is set, before proceeding
with the Link Training check added by this patch. With this, only the
controllers with the quirk will check for the Link Training completion before
proceeding. However, the difference with this new approach compared to the
approach in the v2 patch is that in this new approach, even in the Link Training
Phase, the Link Training check is performed for the controllers with the quirk,
unlike the v2 patch where the Link Training check was performed only during the
Link Retraining Phase through the cdns_pcie_retrain() function.

Also, based on Mani's suggestion, I have measured the latency introduced by the
Link Training check for both quirky and non-quirky controllers at:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/a63fc8b0-581b-897f-cac6-cb0a0e82c63e@ti.com/
If the latency is acceptable, then the current implementation in this v3 patch
could be fine too.

Kindly let me know which approach among the following seems to be the best one:
1. The approach implemented in v2 patch (I will make minor changes to the patch
to print out the "Fatal" error, so that users will be informed of the cause of
the crash, followed by posting a v4 patch with this change).
2. The current implementation in the v3 patch with a check added to see if the
controller has the quirk_retrain_flag set, before proceeding with the Link
Training check.
3. The current implementation in the v3 patch as is, without any modification,
if the latency introduced is not a concern and the sanity check for Link
Training completion for non-quirky controllers appears acceptable.
