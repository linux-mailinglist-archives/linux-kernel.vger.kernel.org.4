Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. As many (most?)
kernel developer don't keep an eye on it, I decided to forward it by
mail. Quoting from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216865 :

See the ticket for more details.

BTW, let me use this mail to also add the report to the list of tracked
regressions to ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks:

#regzbot introduced: 201007ef707a8bb
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216865
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
