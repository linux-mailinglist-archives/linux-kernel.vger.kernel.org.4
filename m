Please, please don't make it sound like some behavior is *the* one and only=
 behavior.
*KVM* *chooses* to intercept debug register accesses.  Though I would omit =
this

a basic understanding of how KVM deals with DRs and #DBs.=20

Please rewrite this to just state what the behavior is instead of "Type A" =
vs.
"Type B".  Outside of AMD, the "type a/b/c" stuff isn't anywhere near ubiqu=
itous
enough to justify obfuscating super simple concepts.

Actually, this feature really has nothing to do with Type A vs. Type B, sin=
ce
that's purely about host state.  I assume the switch from Type A to Type B =
is a
side effect, or an opportunistic optimization?

Regardless, something like this is a lot easier for a human to read.  It's =
easy
enough to find DebugSwap in the APM (literally took me longer to find my co=
py of
the PDF).

  Add support for "DebugSwap for SEV-ES guests", which provides support
  for swapping DR[0-3] and DR[0-3]_ADDR_MASK on VMRUN and VMEXIT, i.e.
  allows KVM to expose debug capabilities to SEV-ES guests.  Without
  DebugSwap support, the CPU doesn't save/load _guest_ debug registers,
  and KVM cannot manually context switch guest DRs due the VMSA being
  encrypted.

  Enable DebugSwap if and only if the CPU also supports NoNestedDataBp,
  which causes the CPU to ignore nested #DBs, i.e. #DBs that occur when
  vectoring a #DB.  Without NoNestedDataBp, a malicious guest can DoS
  the host by putting the CPU into an infinite loop of vectoring #DBs
  (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1278496)

  Set the features bit in sev_es_sync_vmsa() which is the last point
  when VMSA is not encrypted yet as sev_(es_)init_vmcb() (where the most
  init happens) is called not only when VCPU is initialized but also on
  intrahost migration when VMSA is encrypted.

"not needed" isn't sufficient justification.  KVM doesn't strictly need to =
do a
lot of things, but does them anyways for a variety of reasons.  E.g. #DB in=
tercept
is also not needed when NoNestedDataBp is supported and vcpu->guest_debug=
=3D=3D0, i.e.
this should clarify why KVM doesn't simply disable #DB intercepts for _all_=
 VMs
when NoNestedDataBp is support.  Presumably the answer is "because it's sim=
pler
than toggling #DB interception for guest_debug.

Actually, can't disabling #DB interception for DebugSwap SEV-ES guests be a
separate patch?  KVM can still inject #DBs for SEV-ES guests, no?

As for DR7, the real justification is that, as above, KVM can't modify gues=
t DR7,
and intercepting DR7 would completely defeat the purpose of enabling DebugS=
wap.

I don't see how this is relevant or helpful.  What the guest may or may not=
 do in
response to a #VC on a DR7 write has no bearing on KVM's behavior.=20

Since dangling a carrot didn't work[*], I'm going to resort to extortion :-=

Can you fold the below somewhere before this patch, and then tweak this com=
ment
to say something like:

	/*
	 * If DebugSwap is enabled, debug registers are loaded but NOT saved by
	 * the CPU (Type-B).  If DebugSwap is disabled/unsupported, the CPU both
	 * saves and loads debug registers (Type-A).
	 */

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Rewrite sev_es_prepare_switch_to_guest()'s comme=
nt
 about swap types

Rewrite the comment(s) in sev_es_prepare_switch_to_guest() to explain the
swap types employed by the CPU for SEV-ES guests, i.e. to explain why KVM
needs to save a seemingly random subset of host state, and to provide a
decoder for the APM's Type-A/B/C terminology.
