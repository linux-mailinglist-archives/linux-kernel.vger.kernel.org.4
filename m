Unlikely. KVM will count any emulated instructions based on kvm_pmu_incr_counter().
Did I miss some conditions ?

I used to think so, until I saw the AMD64_EVENTSEL_GUESTONLY bit.
Hardware architects are expected to put more effort into this area.

Indeed, and any more detailed complaints ?

I don't think it's feasible to emulate 100% accuracy on Intel. For guest pmu
users, it is motivated by wanting to know how effective they are running on
the current pCPU, and any vPMU eimulation behavior that helps this
understanding would be valuable.
