AFAICT, bpf_flush_icache() calls flush_icache_range(). Despite its name,
flush_icache_range() has d-cache maintenance, i-cache maintenance, and context
synchronization (i.e. it does everything necessary).

As long as you call that with the VAs the code will be executed from, that
should be sufficient, and you don't need to do any other work.

Thanks,
Mark.
