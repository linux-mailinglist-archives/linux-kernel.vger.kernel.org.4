That is not how my understanding of memory.high works. When memory usage 
goes past memory.high, memory reclaim will be initiated to reclaim the 
memory back. Stall happens when memory.usage keep increasing like by 
consuming memory faster than what memory reclaim can recover. When 
memory.max is reached, OOM killer will then kill off the tasks.

IOW, memory consumption should not go past memory.high in normal usage 
scenario. I believe what you describe here isn't quite correct.
