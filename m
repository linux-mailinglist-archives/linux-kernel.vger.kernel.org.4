Please don't hijack this subthread.

I am really struggling to get a correct understanding of the issues
specifically related to the example of the Microchip LAN9662 Ethernet
Controller on a PCI card.  I want this subthread to remain focused
on that, as much as possible.

The below info will be useful in the bigger picture discussion, and
the main thread discussion, but I want to keep this subthread focused
on the one specific example item of hardware.

Thanks (and thanks for all your useful participation over many years),

Frank
