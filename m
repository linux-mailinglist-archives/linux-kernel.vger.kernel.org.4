Heh, that and Weijiang's series is a wee bit incomplete.

The APM doesn't come right out and say it, but I assume/hope that S_CET is saved
on VMRUN and loaded on #VMEXIT, i.e. is the same as VMX for all intents and
purposes.

The host save state definitely has a field for S_CET, and VMRUN documents that the
guest values are loaded, I just can't find anything in the APM that explicitly states
how host S_CET and friends are handled.  E.g. in theory, they could have been
shoved into VMSAVE+VMLOAD, though I very much doubt that's the case.

John?
