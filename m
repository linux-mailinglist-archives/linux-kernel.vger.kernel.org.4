Hi Bjorn and Jason,

According to the discussion so far, I refined the commit message like
below.  How does it look like?

PCI: Add translated request only flag for pci_enable_pasid()

The PCIe fabric routes Memory Requests based on the TLP address, ignoring
the PASID. In order to prevent Memory Requests for PASID, which should
always be routed to the RC, from being mistakenly routed as peer-to-peer
requests, commit 201007ef707a ("PCI: Enable PASID only when ACS RR & UF
enabled on upstream path") requires some ACS features being supported on
device's upstream path when enabling PCI/PASID.

However, above change causes the Linux kernel boots to black screen on a
system with below graphic device:

00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
         [AMD/ATI] Wani [Radeon R5/R6/R7 Graphics] (rev ca)
         (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
         DeviceName: ATI EG BROADWAY
         Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device 8332

The AMD iommu driver allocates a special domain for above device and
enables its PCI PASID/ATS/PRI before attaching the domain to it. The
failure of pci_enable_pasid() due to lack of ACS causes the domain
to fail to be attached to the device. The GPU device is unable to DMA
normally, resulting in a black screen of the system.

The PCIe spec defines Address Translation Service in its chapter 10.
A PCIe Function may contain an ATC. If the ATC Capability Enable bit
is set, the Function can issue Translation Requests. The TA (aka IOMMU)
will respond with a Translation Completion. If the Completion is a CplD,
it contains the translated address and the Function can store the entry
in its ATC. If the TA doesn't have a mapping with the desired permissions,
and the Function's Page Request Capability Enable bit is set, it may
issue a Page Request Message. It's up to the TA to make this message
visible to the OS, which can make the page resident, create an IOMMU
mapping, and respond with a PRG Response Message.  After the Function
receives the PRG Response Message, it would issue another Translation
Request. The Function can then obtain a translated address and store the
entry in its ATC.

The AMD integrated GPU together with its dedicated IOMMU implements above
functionality. It generates Translation Requests (sec 10.2.2) with a PASID
and caches the translated address from the Translation Completion in its
local ATC, and will do DMA (MemRd/Wr) with that translated address without
PASID prefixes. This capability (using translated address for PASID memory
requests) could be detected by software from AMD IOMMU feature bits (GTSup:
Guest translations supported" and PPRSup: Peripheral page request support).

ACS is unnecessary for the devices that only use translated memory request
for PASID. All translated addresses are granted by the Linux kernel which
ensures that such addresses will never be in a P2P address, i.e., it's not
contained in any bridge aperture, will *always* be routed toward the RC.

Add a flag for pci_enable_pasid(), with which the drivers could opt-in
the fact that device always uses translated memory requests for PASID
hence the ACS is not a necessity. Apply this opt-in for above AMD graphic
device.

At present, it is a common practice to enable/disable PCI PASID in the
iommu drivers. Considering that the device driver knows more about the
specific device, it is recommended to move pci_enable_pasid() into the
specific device drivers.

upstream path")
