But that only happens once, right? It still happens, so I don't see
what changes.

I think the refcount_t API already warns if underflow happens.

To be clear, I don't mind if you want to improve this, it's certainly
a mess right now. Tests can't even run in parallel easily because it's
global. Testing like an actually allocated object might be a good way
to simulate a real scenario. And I totally agree that having a real
example is useful to people who want to add support for more kptrs.

Maybe some comments around the code would also be helpful on what the
expectations are. We should make it easy for people to hook into this
stuff. Nobody reads documentation, people usually only look at
existing examples.
