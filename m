I think that can be a good suspect. If the waiters are RT tasks the root cause
might be starvation issue due to bad priority setup and moving to FIFO just
happens to hide it.

For same priority RT tasks, we should behave as FIFO too AFAICS.

If there are a mix of RT vs CFS; RT will always win of course.

I see a potential risk depending on how long the worst case scenario for this
optimistic spinning.

RT tasks can prevent all lower priority RT and CFS from running.

CFS tasks will lose some precious bandwidth from their sched_slice() as this
will be accounted for them as RUNNING time even if they were effectively
waiting.
