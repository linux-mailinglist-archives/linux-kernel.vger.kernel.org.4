Agreed, especially given that some experimentation will be required
to work out which techniques actually help.

Agreed, estimating/modeling energy consumption is as far as I know still
is more of an art than a science.  I did something like eight or nine
rewrites of the old NO_HZ_FULL code learning that one.  ;-)
