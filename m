Thanks.

IMO, instead of bus device, we can call it as root port or down stream
port. Please check the PCI firmware specification, r3.3, section 4.3.13.

Firmware may wish to issue Error Disconnect Recover notification on a port
that is parent of the port that experienced the containment event.

So it is either a downstream port or a root port.

Correct.

Agree that it is not a fatal issue. But leaving the stale error state
is something that needs to be fixed.
