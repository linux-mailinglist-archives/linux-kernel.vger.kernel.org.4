1. If we move the squence:
  	if (buffer_dirty(bh)) {
  		warn_dirty_buffer(bh);
  		JBUFFER_TRACE(jh, "Journalling dirty buffer");
  		clear_buffer_dirty(bh);
  		set_buffer_jbddirty(bh);
  	}

into the branch

         if (jh->b_transaction == transaction ||
  	    jh->b_next_transaction == transaction) {

, then we have a new situation(jh->b_transaction == 
journal->j_committing_transaction) to clear buffer dirty, so we need to 
add an else-branch like(based on v2 patch):
--- a/fs/jbd2/transaction.c
+++ b/fs/jbd2/transaction.c
@@ -1092,6 +1092,10 @@ do_get_write_access(handle_t *handle, struct 
journal_head *jh,
                 spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                 unlock_buffer(bh);
                 goto done;
+       } else if (test_clear_buffer_dirty(bh)) {
+               warn_dirty_buffer(bh);
+               JBUFFER_TRACE(jh, "Journalling dirty buffer");
+               set_buffer_jbddirty(bh);
         }
         unlock_buffer(bh);

I think we'd better not to move the sequence?

2. I agree that the assertions in branch 'if (jh->b_transaction)' are 
redundant, I will remove them in v3. Thanks for pointing that.

Yes.
I think one reason we have non-empty commit_transaction->t_reserved_list 
is that: jbd2_journal_restart() could let jh attach to transaction_1 and 
dirty jh in transaction_2.

buffer is dirty after trans_0 committed
do_get_write_access() =>  jh->trans = old_handle->trans_1, clear buffer 
dirty & set jbddirty, BJ_Reserved
jbd2_journal_restart()  => stop old_handle && may jbd2_log_start_commit 
&& start new_handle with trans_2
jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() => clear jbddirty & set buffer dirty & 
set jh->b_transaction = NULL
do_checkpoint  => buffer is fell on disk. If do_get_write_access() not 
mark jbddirty, buffer won't be fell on disk after checkpoint, which 
could corrupt filesystem.

I'm not sure whether we have the above path in realworld. I guess it 
exists in theory according to the comments:
        /* 

         * First thing we are allowed to do is to discard any remaining 

         * BJ_Reserved buffers.  Note, it is _not_ permissible to assume 

         * that there are no such buffers: if a large filesystem 

         * operation like a truncate needs to split itself over multiple 

         * transactions, then it may try to do a jbd2_journal_restart() 
while
          * there are still BJ_Reserved buffers outstanding.  These must 

          * be released cleanly from the current transaction. 

          * 

          * In this case, the filesystem must still reserve write access 

          * again before modifying the buffer in the new transaction, 
but
          * we do not require it to remember exactly which old buffers 
it
          * has reserved.  This is consistent with the existing 
behaviour
          * that multiple jbd2_journal_get_write_access() calls to the 
same
          * buffer are perfectly permissible. 

          * We use journal->j_state_lock here to serialize processing of 

          * t_reserved_list with eviction of buffers from 
journal_unmap_buffer().
          */ 

         while (commit_transaction->t_reserved_list) {  [...]
