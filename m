this is MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_SHARED? and won't they get converted to shared policy for the backing shmfs? via

	} else if (vm_flags & VM_SHARED) {
		error = shmem_zero_setup(vma);
		if (error)
			goto free_vma;
	} else {
		vma_set_anonymous(vma);
	}

I agree that walking all the related vma is already done in folio_check_references. I was
checking do we really need to check all the vma in case of memory policy.

On the page fault side for non anonymous vma we only respect the memory policy of the
task faulting the page in. With that restrictions we could always say if demotion
node is allowed by the policy of any task sharing this vma, we can demote the
page to that specific node?

Agreed. Right now these applications when they fail to allocate memory from
the Node on which they are running, they fallback to nearby NUMA nodes rather than
failing the database query. They would want to prevent fallback of some allocation
to slow cxl memory to avoid hot database tables getting allocated from the cxl
memory node. In that case one way they can consume slow cxl memory is to partition
the data structure using membind and allow cold pages to demoted back to
slow cxl memory making space for hot page allocation in the running NUMA node. 

Other option is to run the application using fsdax.

I am still not clear which option will get used finally.
