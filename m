IMHO we can't avoid reclaiming from the fast nodes entirely if we
prioritize avoiding OOMs. But it should happen very very rarely with
the throttling logic or other methods. BTW did you run any test to see
how many times vmscan reclaims from fast nodes instead of demotion
with the current implementation for some typical workloads?
