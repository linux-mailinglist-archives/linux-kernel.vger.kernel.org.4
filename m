It is.

Please add that excerpt to the commit message.

Yes I think so.

We need to differentiate between two cases:

(1) DPC handled by firmware, hotplug handled by OS:

    In this case clearing DPC trigger status from pciehp device removal
    code path seems reasonable.  But it must be constrained to
    !host_bridge->native_dpc.

(2) DPC handled by OS:

    In this case clearing DPC trigger status from pciehp could race with
    the dpc interrupt handler so must not be done.  Instead, I recommend
    clearing trigger status from the dpc interrupt handler.  You should
    see a Surprise Down error handled by the dpc interrupt handler.
    Make sure DPC trigger status is *always* cleared in that case.
    
    Note that Smita Koralahalli is currently working on something similar:
    
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230418210526.36514-2-Smita.KoralahalliChannabasappa@amd.com/

    (@Smita sorry for the delay, I'll get to your patches ASAP.)

I recommend splitting the two cases above into two commits, one for
firmware-handled DPC and one for OS-native DPC.  IIUC, you only need
the former to address Dell's finding.

Thanks,

Lukas
