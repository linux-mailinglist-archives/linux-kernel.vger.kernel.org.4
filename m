But there are two ways to enter s2idle (well or the S0ix whatever is the
AMD term for that). Either through system sleep or simply waiting that
all the needed devices runtime suspend. There should be no difference
from device perspective AFAICT.

AFAIK this object does not exist in ChromeOS so Linux cannot use it
there.

I think the corresponding entry in ADL-P system for TBT PCIe root port 0
looks like this:

	Package (0x03)
	{
	    "\\_SB.PC00.TRP0",
	    Zero, 
	    Package (0x02)
	    {
		Zero, 
		Package (0x02)
		{
		    0xFF, 
		    0x03
		}
	    }
	},

I'm not entirely sure what does it tell? ;-)
