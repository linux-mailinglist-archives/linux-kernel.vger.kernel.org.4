If we decided that disabled devices should probe, then that is exactly
what will have to be done. The restriction (of shared pins) is in the
devices and is potentially per device, so it makes more sense for the
device's drivers to handle than the host bridge IMO. (Assuming the
core doesn't handle a per device property.)

I think we need to define what behavior is correct for 'status =3D
"disabled"'. For almost everywhere in DT, it is equivalent to the
device is not present. A not present device doesn't probe. There are
unfortunately cases where status got ignored/forgotten and PCI was one
of those. PCI is a bit different since there are 2 sources of
information about a device being present. The intent with PCI is DT
overrides what's discovered. For example, 'vendor-id' overrides what's
read from the h/w.

I think we can fix making the status per function simply by making
'match_driver' be set based on the status. This would move the check
later to just before probing. That would not work for a case where
accessing the config registers is a problem. It doesn't sound like
that's a problem for Loongson based on the above response, but their
original solution did prevent that. This change would also mean the
PCI quirks would run. Perhaps the func0 memory clearing you need could
be run as a quirk instead?
