+KVM_PV_ASYNC_CLEANUP_PREPARE
+  Prepare the current protected VM for asynchronous teardown. Most
+  resources used by the current protected VM will be set aside for a
+  subsequent asynchronous teardown. The current protected VM will then
+  resume execution immediately as non-protected. There can be at most
+  one protected VM prepared for asynchronous teardown at any time. If
+  a protected VM had already been prepared for teardown without
+  subsequently calling KVM_PV_ASYNC_CLEANUP_PERFORM, this call will
+  fail. In that case, the userspace process should issue a normal
+  KVM_PV_DISABLE. The resources set aside with this call will need to
+  be cleaned up with a subsequent call to KVM_PV_ASYNC_CLEANUP_PERFORM
+  or KVM_PV_DISABLE, otherwise they will be cleaned up when KVM
+  terminates. KVM_PV_ASYNC_CLEANUP_PREPARE can be called again as soon

+KVM_PV_ASYNC_CLEANUP_PERFORM
+  Tear down the protected VM previously prepared for teardown with

+  fatal signal is received (or the process terminates naturally), the
+  command will terminate immediately without completing, and the normal
+  KVM shutdown procedure will take care of cleaning up all remaining
+  protected VMs, including the ones whose teardown was interrupted by
+  process termination.
