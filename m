That make sense to me. I am OK to leave it for now as it is an 
optimization patch anyway.

BTW, another question that I have is about the cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem. 
It is currently a percpu rwsem. Is it possible to change it into a 
regular rwsem instead? It is causing quite a bit of latency for 
workloads that require rather frequent changes to cgroups. I know we 
have a "favordynmods" mount option to disable the percpu operation. This 
will still be less performant than a normal rwsem. Of course the 
downside is that the fork/exit fastpaths will be slowed down a bit.

Thanks,
Longman
