If i_reserved_data_block, it means that there is something wrong with
our delayed allocation accounting.  However, this accounting is
usually only an in-memory error.  The one exception is if quota is
enabled, in which case the space is decremented from the
user/group/project quota.

However, if quota is not in use, which is the overwhelmingly common
case, there will be nothing for fsck to repair.  (It does mean that df
will show a slightly smaller free space value due to the messed up
delayed allocation accounting, but that disappears after a reboot.)

Marking the file system as in need of repair when nothing is actually
wrong with the on-disk file system can backfire, in that it confuses
users when they see the ext4 error but then when they run fsck, fsck
reports nothing wrong --- at which point they file a bug.

We could use ext4_error if quotas are enabled, and ext4_msg if not,
but it might not worth the extra complexity.

Cheers,
