Instead of having the OS recognize and filter Surprise Down events,
it would also be possible to simply set the Surprise Down bit in the
Uncorrectable Error Mask Register.  This could be constrained to
Downstream Ports capable of surprise removal, i.e. those where the
is_hotplug_bridge in struct pci_dev is set.  And that check and the
register change could be performed in pci_dpc_init().

Have you considered such an alternative approach?  If you have, what
was the reason to prefer the more complex solution you're proposing?

I don't understand why PCI_STATUS and PCI_EXP_DEVSTA need to be
touched here?

Since this function is located in dpc.c and is strictly called from
other functions in the same file, it should be prefixed dpc_, not
pciehp_.

That looks like a reasonable change, but it belongs in a separate
patch.  And I think it should be performed as part of (de-)enumeration,
not as part of DPC error handling.  What about Downstream Ports which
are not DPC-capable, I guess the bits should be cleared as well, no?

How about clearing the bits in pciehp_unconfigure_device()?

Thanks,

Lukas
