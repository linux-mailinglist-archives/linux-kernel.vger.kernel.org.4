so if I understand the above correctly, pte_offset_map_lock will only
fail if the whole page table has disappeared, and in that case, it will
never reappear with zero pages, therefore we can safely skip (in that
case just break). if we were to do a continue instead of a break, we
would most likely fail again anyway.

in that case I would still like a small change in your patch: please
write a short (2~3 lines max) comment about why it's ok to do things
that way
