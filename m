But of course its true :)

binding document define the reg property for drivers that do registers 
access.

If you define it one way or the other that shall change the driver 
mapping policy/method.

The way drivers are being probed is based on compatible found in DT.

So you only get one platform driver probe per device described in DT.

If we have single device described in DT then we won't have two distinct 
platform drivers getting probe.

(We could not have them platform driver and have them as regular module 
which go and look "manually" for that device... but that looks too hacky).


As we do consider two distinct drivers the idea was to have two devices 
described in DT. One gets the registers subset it want while the other 
get the registers it want.


So how would you have the DT described and how would driver/s look like 
for cases that the unit registers are split interchangeably?
