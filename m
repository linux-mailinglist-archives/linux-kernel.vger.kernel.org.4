Isn't this something to be configured on the demotion topology side? Or
do you expect there will be per process/address space usecases? I mean
different processes running on the same topology, one requesting local
demotion while other ok with the whole demotion topology?

mm->owner is a wrong direction. It doesn't have a strong meaning because
there is no one task explicitly responsible for the mm so there is no
real owner (our clone() semantic is just to permissive for that). The
memcg::owner is a crude and ugly hack and it should go away over time
rather than build new uses.

Besides that, and as I have already tried to explain, per task demotion
policy is what makes this whole thing expensive. So this better be a per
mm or per vma property. Whether it is a on/off knob like PR_[GS]ET_THP_DISABLE
or there are explicit requirements for fine grain control on the vma
level I dunno. I haven't seen those usecases yet and it is really easy
to overengineer this.

To be completely honest I would much rather wait for those usecases
before adding a more complex APIs.  PR_[GS]_DEMOTION_DISABLED sounds
like a reasonable first step. Should we have more fine grained
requirements wrt address space I would follow the MADV_{NO}HUGEPAGE
lead.

If we really need/want to give a fine grained control over demotion
nodemask then we would have to go with vma->mempolicy interface. In
any case a per process on/off knob sounds like a reasonable first step
before we learn more about real usecases.
