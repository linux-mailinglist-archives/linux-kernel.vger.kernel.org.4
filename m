And some other differences:

1. *fruit* devices use an ARM64 which is already documented anyway.
2. *fruit* devices are more "popular" and the maintainer can test on it
more easily.  And *fruit* have more fans (esp. more fans with CS/EE
skills, while we have more [expletive deleted] fans :( ) so their
reverse-engineer effort is easier as well.  Yes it may be not fair to
others, but the world is just not fair.
3. *fruit* is really a bad example... When people ask me how to build
Linux From Scratch on *fruit* I just tell them "try to avoid things from
a vendor with no intention to allow you run another OS".
