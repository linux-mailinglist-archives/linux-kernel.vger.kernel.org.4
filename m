Just running bpf_nf selftest would have shown this is false.

What you want is to simply follow type at off = 0 (but still enforce the off = 0
requirement). This is something which is currently done for bpf_sk_release (for
struct sk_common) in check_reg_type, but it is not safe in general to just open
this up for all cases. I suggest encoding this particular requirement in the
argument, and simply using triple underscore variant of the type for the special
'read_only' requirement. This will allow you to use same type in your BPF C
program, while allowing verifier to see them as two different types in kfunc
parameters. Then just relax type following for the particular argument so that
one can pass cpumask_t___ro to kfunc expecting cpumask_t (but only at off = 0,
it just visits first member after failing match on top level type). off = 0
check is still necessary.

So offset checks still need to be according to OBJ_RELEASE but you can relax
strict_type_match bool for the particular arg when calling btf_struct_ids_match.

All code in your tests will then deal with a cpumask_t type only, including in
kfunc declarations. Same as bpf_nf selftests which don't cast from/to
nf_conn___init and only deal with nf_conn pointers even though semantics differ
depending on how it is used and passed around. Overall more convenient and
simple to use.
