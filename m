I don't know what's coming as far as pci_doe_submit_task() callers.
If there's some imminent caller that will require atomic context, I
guess we could solve it now.  But DOE doesn't really seem like an
atomic context thing to begin with, so maybe we could postpone dealing
with it.

That patch in [3] is more complicated than I expected, but I admit I
haven't looked closely.
