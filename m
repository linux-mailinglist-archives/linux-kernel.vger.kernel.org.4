Doesn't it go against the MC EDAC concept...?

Reinventing the wheel is something that usually doesn't end well. (I 
could probably list them but guess that as the EDAC maintainer you can 
do it better than me :)  )

I would probably consider the other way around - take the refresh-rate 
driver inside the MC driver as the refresh-rate does not use any 
"memory" framework under drivers/memory.
