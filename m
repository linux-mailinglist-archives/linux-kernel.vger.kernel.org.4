Yes.  The definition is clear if nodes= from the same memory tier.

It appears that the definition isn't very clear here.  How many pages
should be demoted?  The target number is the value echoed to
memory.reclaim?  Or requested_number - pages_in_lowest_tier?  Should we
demote in as many tiers as possible or in as few tiers as possible?  One
possibility is to take advantage of top tier memory as much as
possible.  That is, try to reclaim pages in lower tiers only.

Agree.
