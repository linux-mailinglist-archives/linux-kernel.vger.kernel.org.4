In a changelog, no.  You do *NOT* use super technical language in
changelogs if not super necessary.  Mentioning "TDSYSINFO_STRUCT" here
is useless.  The *MOST* you would do for a good changelog is:

	The kernel takes CMRs (plus a little more metadata) and
	constructs "TD Memory Regions" (TDMRs).

You just need to talk about things at a high level in mostly
non-technical language so that folks know the structure of the code
below.  It's not a replacement for the code, the comments, *OR* the TDX
module specification.

I'm also not quite sure that this justifies the static variables anyway.
 They could be dynamically allocated and passed around, for instance.

Kill all mentions to TDSYSINFO_STRUCT whatsoever in the changelog.
Write comprehensible English.

Because you're adding a massive structure with all kinds of fields.
Those fields mostly aren't used.  That could be from an error in this
series, or because they will be used later or because they will *never*
be used.

I think you're confusing two separate things.  MCHECK ensures that there
is convertible memory.  The CMRs that this code looks at are software
(TD module) defined and created structures that the OS and the module share.

This cmr_array[] structure is not created by MCHECK.

Go look at your code.  Consider what will happen if cmr_array[0] is
empty or !is_cmr_ok().  Then consider what will happen if cmr_array[1]
has the same happen.

Does that end result really justify having separate code for
cmr_array[0] and cmr_array[>0]?

So it's just about printing them?

Then put a dang switch to the print function that says "print them all"
or not.

OK, so you're going to get some more homework here.  Please explain to
me how MCHECK and the CMR array that comes out of the TDX module are
related.  How does the output from MCHECK get turned into the in-memory
cmr_array[], step by step?

At this point, I fear that you're offering up MCHECK like it's a bag of
magic beans rather than really truly thinking about the cmr_array[] data
structure.  How it is generated?  How might it be broken? Who might
break it?   If so, what the kernel should do about it?

But then you still have the "trimming" code.  Why not just trust "r9"
and then axe all the trimming code?  Heck, and most of the sanity checks.

This code could be a *lot* smaller.
