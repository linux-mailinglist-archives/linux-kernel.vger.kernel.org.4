It can't be another pstore backend since, pstore backend(ram) is for
the system where there is a guarantees of fixed ram range content 
persist across boot, but that is not true with minidump, there is no
pstorefs kind of support with minidump.

Instead, the whole idea of backend/front-end of minidump here, is
entirely related to minidump and here minidump backend could be
anything like could be Shared memory in DDR which is shared across
multiple subsystem (CPUSS) is one of them or it could be something
where you want to collect minidump for a guest vm which guest
does not have access to backend instead it may be the hypervisor
do the register the region for the guest.

Pstore(ram) is one of the clients of minidump where, we want to collect
the console/pmsg/ftrace/dmesg logs for production devices where
DDR dump is difficult and the reason of doing this to not re-invent
the wheel and it just need physical address/size .
