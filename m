I agree. The function name can be changed to indicate that it is waiting for
completion rather than indicating completion. If this is the only change, I will
post a patch to fix it. On the other hand, based on your comments in the next
section, I am thinking of an alternative approach of merging the current
"cdns_pcie_host_training_complete()" function's operation as well into the
"cdns_pcie_host_wait_for_link()" function. If this is acceptable, I will post a
different patch and the name change patch won't be necessary.

Is it acceptable to merge "cdns_pcie_host_training_complete()" into
"cdns_pcie_host_wait_for_link()"?

I assume you are referring to merging the functions together?

If the functions are merged, I believe that the word "host" can be dropped in
the new function which can be named "cdns_pcie_wait_for_link()" as suggested by you.

Please let me know.
