No, that's not true and such DT description will get probably Rob's or
mine comments. The HW shall be described without tying to one, specific
driver implementation. Otherwise why do you make it tightly coupled to
Linux, but ignore BSD, firmware and bootloaders?

Don't tightly couple DT with your drivers.

Again, the driver does not matter. You have one device, describe
properly one device. DT is not to describe drivers.

You did not Cc relevant here mailing addresses (DT and Rob), so this
discussion might miss their feedback.

How the drivers map IO address space is independent question and should
not determine the hardware description. You want to say that hardware
changes depending on OS? One OS means hardware is like that and on other
OS it's different?

Drivers are not related to DT bindings and DTS. Two different things.
