Ok, I have checked and seems that I have removed my notes :-(

So trying to reconstruct information from my memory...

Target link speed in Root port's lnkctl2 register must be set to
_correct_ value before configuring ASPM. Because link retraining (part
of ASPM configuration) fails. ASPM is initialized by calling function
pcie_aspm_init_link_state() from _non-endpoint_ device and it is called
at the end of function pci_scan_slot().

Look also at the tree-traversal functions pci_scan_child_bus_extend()
and pci_scan_bridge_extend() and try to find the best place where should
be this "fix" called.

Because same issue as you are trying to fix is also in pci-aardvark.c
hardware (Marvell too), I think that you can introduce some flag in
struct pci_host_bridge, set it in pci-mvebu.c (later I can do same in
pci-aardvark.c) and then in core pci code (in some of above mentioned
function when you find the proper place in tree traversal) add code
which "fixes" lnkctl2 register.

Because both pci hotplug and static initialization calls those pci core
scan functions, this should fix init-probe part.

Second thing is fixing unplugging part. Because in hotplug setup you can
connect 2.5GT/s GEN1 card (which requires this workaround), then
disconnect it and connect some 5GT/s GEN2 card, it is needed to set
target link back to 5GT/s to use full speed of GEN2 card.

For this second part, I think that it is needed to change target link
speed back to 5GT/s after card is disconnected. As a good candidates
where to do it is probably pci_stop_dev() or pci_destroy_dev() function.
Beware that it is needed to change link speed of device on the other end
of link - not the device which is being removed/unregistered. And check
if it is the last kernel device being unregistered from the bus
(endpoint card may be multifunction device).

I hope that this information would help you. I'm really sorry that I do
not have my notes about this issue where I documented it. Anyway I would
try to provide other information if needed.
