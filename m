Sure, but then it needs to be clearly documented so.

Intel "arch" guys? You might look up the meanings of "arch" in a
dictionary. LKML is not twatter.

That's the whole point where this discussion started: _AFTER_ it gets
initialized.

Which means that, e.g. adding "nosmt" to the kernel command line will
make TDX fail hard because at the point where TDX is initialized the
hyperthreads are not 'soft' online and cannot respond to anything, but
the BIOS already accounted them.

This is just wrong as we all know that "nosmt" is sadly one of the
obvious counter measures for the never ending flood of speculation
issues.

TDX can rightfully impose the limitation that it only executes on CPUs,
which are known at boot/initialization time, and only utilizes "known"
memory. That's it, but that does not enforce to prevent physical hotplug
in general.

That MCHECK falls into the category of security voodoo.

It needs to verify _ALL_ logical CPUs to ensure that Intel did not put
different models and steppings into a package or what?

You surely need MCHECK for this

More security voodoo. The TDX security perimeter has nothing to do with
adding or removing CPUs on a system. If that'd be true then TDX is a
complete fail.

If the BIOS does not prevent it, then TDX and the Seam module will not
even notice unless the OS tries to invoke seamcall() on a newly plugged
CPU.

A newly added CPU and newly added memory should not have any impact on
the TDX integrity of the already running system. If they have then
again, TDX is broken by design.

to ensure that the MCHECK generated table is still valid at the point
where TDX is initialized?=20

That said, this documentation is at least better than the existing void,
but that does not make it technically correct.
