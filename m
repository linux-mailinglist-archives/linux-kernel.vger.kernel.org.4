This is the cost of making small incremental changes that should be easier to review.
The intermediate step was a little odd, so came with a comment. (I normally mark those as
'temporary', but didn't bother this time as they are adjacent patches)

If you'd prefer, I can merge these patches together... but from Reinette's feedback its
likely I'll split them up even more.


Thanks,

James
