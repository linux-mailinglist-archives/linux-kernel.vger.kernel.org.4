Why do you think so?  PCIe r6.0.1 sec 7.8.4.3 says:

   "A masked error [...] is not recorded or reported in the Header Log,
    TLP Prefix Log, or First Error Pointer, and is not reported to the
    PCI Express Root Complex by this Function."

So if you set the Surprise Down Error Mask bit on hotplug ports
capable of surprise removal, there should be no logging and thus
no logs to clear.

I disagree, I think it's worth a try.  Below please find a patch which
sets the Surprise Down Error mask bit.  Could you test if this fixes
the issue for you?

I think we cannot discern whether a Surprise Down Error is caused by
surprise removal or is a true error.  We must assume the former on
surprise-capable hotplug ports.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: pciehp: Disable Surprise Down Error reporting

On hotplug ports capable of surprise removal, Surprise Down Errors are
expected and no reason for AER or DPC to spring into action.  Although
a Surprise Down event might be caused by an error, software cannot
discern that from regular surprise removal.

Any well-behaved BIOS should mask such errors, but Smita reports a case
where hot-removing an Intel NVMe SSD [8086:0a54] from an AMD Root Port
[1022:14ab] results in irritating AER log messages and a delay of more
than 1 second caused by DPC handling:

  pcieport 0000:00:01.4: DPC: containment event, status:0x1f01 source:0x0000
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4: DPC: unmasked uncorrectable error detected
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Uncorrected (Fatal), type=Transaction Layer, (Receiver ID)
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4:   device [1022:14ab] error status/mask=00000020/04004000
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4:    [ 5] SDES (First)
  nvme nvme2: frozen state error detected, reset controller
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4: DPC: Data Link Layer Link Active not set in 1000 msec
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4: AER: subordinate device reset failed
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4: AER: device recovery failed
  pcieport 0000:00:01.4: pciehp: Slot(16): Link Down
  nvme2n1: detected capacity change from 1953525168 to 0
  pci 0000:04:00.0: Removing from iommu group 49

Avoid by masking Surprise Down Errors on hotplug ports capable of
surprise removal.

Mask them even if AER or DPC is handled by firmware because if hotplug
control was granted to the operating system, it owns hotplug and thus
Surprise Down events.  So firmware has no business reporting or reacting
to them.
