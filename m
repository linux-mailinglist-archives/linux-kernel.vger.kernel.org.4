Thanks for mentioning IRQ affinity because that reminds me of a
long-standing related issue.  Pali posted a similar patch for mvebu
[1], but it's been stalled for a long time because apparently there's
some potential breakage of the userspace ABI [2].

Unfortunately I'm not an IRQ expert and haven't followed all the
arguments there.  BUT it does seem like Marc's objection to Pali's
patch would also apply to your patch, so maybe this is an opportune
time to re-evaluate the situation.

If converting from chained to normal handlers can be done safely, I
would definitely be in favor if doing it across all of drivers/pci/ at
once so they're all consistent.  Otherwise that code just gets copied
to new drivers, so the issue persists and spreads.
