Yeah, that makes sense.  I just used the "bus device" language because
that's what's in the ACPI spec.  But I think the PCI terms would
probably be more helpful here.  And I'll cite the r6.5 spec instead of
v6.3.

Right.

Definitely agree we should clear the stale state.  I just meant that I
don't think it matters that we clear the status *after* exiting DPC,
instead of clearing it before exiting DPC as shown in the flowchart.
