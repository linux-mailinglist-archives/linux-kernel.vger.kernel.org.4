Describing the hardware accurately and completely means to have multiple 
reg property in the device-tree, right?

That way we will split the HW description to smaller bits rather then 
just big "ddrc", and that shall allow us to have two drivers and each 
one will get its own share of the split, right?

That was the intent of solution 1 below.

Can you elaborate on this inaccurate hardware description?

Also, I'd like to write down my understanding of your response from above:

it seems you see as possible solution both using different API that 
allow overlapping (solution 2) and also for splitting the IO address 
space to finer pieces to achieve full HW description (solution 1)
