Ah yeah, fair enough. Got confused because it's part of the same
bpf_type_flag enum. I think the point in general stands though.

Great, that's a nice simplification.

That makes sense for PTR_UNTRUSTED, what about the other type modifiers
like PTR_MAYBE_NULL? We set and unset if a ptr is NULL throughout a
function, so we'd have to record if it was previously trusted in order
to properly re-OR after a NULL check.

We could, but that changes the meaning of PTR_TRUSTED and IMO makes it
harder to reason about. Before it was just "the kernel passed this arg
to the program and promises the program that it was trusted when it was
first passed". Now it's that plus it could mean that it points to an
allocated object from bpf_obj_new()". IMO we should keep all of these
modifiers separate so that the presence of a modifier has a well-defined
meaning that we can interpret in each context as needed.  In this case,
we can make trust opt-in, so a KF_TRUSTED_ARGS BTF pointer either of the
following:

1. reg->ref_obj_id > 0
2. Either one of PTR_TRUSTED | MEM_ALLOC type modifiers are set, and no
   others.

Let me know if that sounds OK to you.

Agreed that after the rebase this would no longer be correct. I think we
should make it opt-in, though. PTR_TRUSTED | MEM_ALLOC is fine.
PTR_TRUSTED | MEM_ALLOC | PTR_MAYBE_NULL would not be.
