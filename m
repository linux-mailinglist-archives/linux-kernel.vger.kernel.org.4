Is there somewhere in the PCIe spec I can read about how a link with
clocks turned off can remain in L1.1 or L1.2?

I'm looking at this text in PCIe r6.0, sec 5.4.1:

  Components in the D0 state (i.e., fully active state) normally keep
  their Upstream Link in the active L0 state, as defined in § Section
  5.3.2 . ASPM defines a protocol for components in the D0 state to
  reduce Link power by placing their Links into a low power state and
  instructing the other end of the Link to do likewise. This
  capability allows hardware-autonomous, dynamic Link power reduction
  beyond what is achievable by software-only controlled (i.e., PCI-PM
  software driven) power management.

How does this qcom software management of clocks fit into this scheme?
It seems to me that if you need software to turn clocks off and on,
that is no longer ASPM.
