The question is what the user-visible difference between
CONFIG_DW_EDMA_PCIE=y and CONFIG_DW_EDMA_PCIE=m is.  If there were no
difference, dw_pcie_host_init() would not need to call
dw_pcie_edma_detect().

Can you give me a one- or two-sentence merge commit comment that
explains why we want to merge this?  "Relax driver config settings"
doesn't tell us that.
