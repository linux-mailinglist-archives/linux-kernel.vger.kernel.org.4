Nope, not going down that road.  Fool me once[*], shame on you.  Fool me twice,
shame on me :-)

Objections to hardware vendors defining PV interfaces aside, there exist leafs
that are neither PV related nor known to the TDX module, e.g. Centaur leafs.  I
think it's extremely unlikely (understatement) that anyone will want to expose
Centaur leafs to a TDX guest, but again I want to say out of the business of
telling userspace what is and isn't sane CPUID models.

Yes, except KVM doesn't need to verify vCPUs are consistent with respect to each
other, just that each vCPU is consistent with respect to what was reported to the
TDX Module.

It's not complicated at all.  Walk through the leafs defined during TDH.MNG.INIT,
reject KVM_SET_CPUID if a leaf isn't present or doesn't match exactly.  Or has
the TDX spec changed and it's no longer that simple?
