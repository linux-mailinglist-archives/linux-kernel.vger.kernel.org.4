I think it would be better to talk in terms of under what conditions
the overlay support is adequate (for production) rather than a blanket
statement that it is not-production ready. A large part of it is
really outside the code itself and related to going from static to
dynamic DT. There are certainly issues, but dynamic DTs have been used
in production for a very long time. However, that usage has been
constrained.
