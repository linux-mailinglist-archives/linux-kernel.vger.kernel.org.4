Also here I wonder how you came up with this computational model. This
is not same as saying it is wrong. There's just whole stack of options.

Out of top of my head you could e.g. window average the duration between
IRQs. When the average goes beyond threshold, then you shutdown
interrupts.

The pro I would see in this that it is much easier intuitively discuss
how much there should be time in-between interrupts that the kernel
handles it, than how many IRQs you can stack into time interval, which
blows my head tbh.
