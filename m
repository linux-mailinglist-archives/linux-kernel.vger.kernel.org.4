Hi Rick,

Thanks very much for your work.

So we merged cf590b078391 ("PCI: rockchip: Add EP driver for Rockchip
PCIe controller") when it actually didn't work?  Ouch.  Thanks for
fixing it and testing it.

For the next iteration, can you please update these subject lines and
commit logs to:

  - Use imperative mood, i.e., read like a command, instead of a past
    tense description of what was done.  For example, say "Remove
    writes to unused registers" instead of "Removed writes ..."

  - Be more specific when possible.  "Fix" conveys no information
    about the actual code change.  For example, "Fixed endpoint
    controller Configuration Request Retry Status" gives a general
    idea, but it would be more useful if it said something about
    clearing config mode after probe.

  - Say what the patch does in the commit log.  The current ones often
    describe a *problem*, but do not explicitly say what the patch
    does.  The commit log should be complete in itself even without
    the subject line, so it usually contains a slightly expanded
    version of the subject line.

  - Split patches that do more than one logical thing.  The commit log
    for "Fixed MSI generation ..." talks about a u16/u32 shift issue,
    but the patch also adds an unrelated check for multi-function
    devices.

  - If a patch is a fix for an existing issue and may need to be
    backported, identify the commit that introduced the issue and add
    "Fixes: " lines.  This helps distros figure out whether and how
    far to backport patches.

  - Refer to the device consistently.  I see:
      RK3399 PCI EP core
      RK3399 SoC PCIe EP core
      RK3399 PCIe endpoint core
    I vote for "RK3399 PCIe Endpoint core".
