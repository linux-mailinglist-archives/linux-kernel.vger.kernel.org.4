It'd be great, if, in the future, you would hold off on sending new
versions of patchsets where the previous version is still being
discussed [3].
~3 days between versions is not very much, especially when that includes
a weekend!
I know you replied there earlier today with your opinion, but please
give people a chance to read and respond, before resubmitting, so as not
to split discussion between several threads.

Thanks,
Conor.
