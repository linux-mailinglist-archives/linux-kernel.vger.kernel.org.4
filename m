Kind-of; according to the LoongArch Toolchain Conventions [1], 
-msoft-float basically selects the soft-float ABI, but *also prevents 
use of any FP instructions*. This is where things get hairy, because it 
means e.g. any translation unit can't manipulate the FP context at all 
without special-casing its CFLAGS to have the -msoft-float flag removed. 
I've tried and stopped when I noticed >3 files needed such treatment 
even in arch/loongarch/kernel alone; -mabi=lp64s is always present right 
now and that's enough.

Just as Ruoyao explained earlier, it's the "small data threshold". It's 
not implemented on LoongArch yet, and we don't have ABI provisions for 
that either, so IMO it's even okay to just drop it unconditionally. (I 
haven't double-checked the GCC behavior though.)

As explained above, proper support for "small data optimization" 
probably means some cooperation from ABI side (e.g. reserving a GP 
register for being able to reference +/-4KiB from it with a single 
insn), so I don't expect this to happen anytime soon.
