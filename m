Understood. I dropped the FALLOC flag from the series in v3, instead
we now rely on the filesystem's mount/policy.

Thanks for the feedback! On ChromeOS, we still have filesystems shared
between applications, partly due to inertia of adoption. So, we have a
few cases of needing to share the filesystem but with differing
provisioning policy.

One more idea that I've been exploring in this space and uses the
above file-based mechanism is to use a 'provisioning disabled'
fallocated file to make the apparent free space in the thinly
provisioned filesystem match the space available in the thinpool. In
theory, this prevents userspace applications from writing much more
than what's available on the thinpool. In practice, it depends on the
responsiveness of the service that monitors and resizes this 'storage
balloon'.
