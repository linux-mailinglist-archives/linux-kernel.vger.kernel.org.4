The rationale was that we reverted exepected userspace expection for
something that was sync to async so broke userspace expectations and
we can't do that.

As soon as commit 63f93fd6fa5717 ("block: mark blk_put_queue as
potentially blocking") on v6.2-rc1 it was upgraded to might_sleep()
directly on blk_put_queue(), I can't find a rationale after that
to justify the removal. But since it is not clear if we keep it,
we should document that rationale.
