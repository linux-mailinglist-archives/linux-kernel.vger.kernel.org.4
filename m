The above said, if people really do care about custom_method, it can
be retained, but its documentation needs to be updated to cover the
current requirements (according to Rui, they have changed after some
upstream ACPICA changes).

Also note that the upstream ACPICA may not be guaranteed to avoid
breaking this interface in the future, as it depends on
acpi_install_method() that is provided by ACPICA specifically for the
use in the AML debugger.
