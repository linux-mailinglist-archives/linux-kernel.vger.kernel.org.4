Are you suggesting "best effort limits" or "best effort <something>"? It 
would sounds good to me if we found the right <something>. Best effort 
budget perhaps?

It's well impressive you were able to figure out what I am doing there. 
:) And probably you can see that this is the first time I am attempting 
an algorithm like this one. I think I made it /dtrt/ with a few post/pre 
walks so the right pieces of data propagate correctly.

Are you suggesting a parallel/shadow tree to be kept in the drm 
controller (which would shadow the cgroup hierarchy)? Or something else? 
The mention of rbtree is not telling me much, but I will look into the 
referenced examples. (Although I will refrain from major rework until 
more people start "biting" into all this.)

Also, when you mention scalability you are concerned about multiple tree 
walks I have per iteration? I wasn't so much worried about that, 
definitely not for the RFC, but even in general due relatively low 
frequency of scanning and a good amount of less trivial cost being 
outside the actual tree walks (drm client walks, GPU utilisation 
calculations, maybe more). But perhaps I don't have the right idea on 
how big cgroups hierarchies can be compared to number of drm clients etc.

Tvrtko
