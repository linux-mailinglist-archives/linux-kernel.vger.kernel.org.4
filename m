Even if you haven't seen a battery life issue, I suspect you might be
able to measure a power consumption difference if you looked for it
and likely could see issues with manual ASPM enable/disable using
sysfs.  That might be a legitimate reason for this quirk, and if it
is, we should mention it here.

The current version of that code:
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/pcie/aspm.c?id=v6.1#n760
doesn't search for the L1SS capability; it uses dev->l1ss just like
your patch does.  So it should restore the capability even though the
linked list is broken.

This fix is risky, too, because it writes to random places in config
space and there's no guarantee that this is safe or even that the
capabilities are at those locations.

Maybe you can make a public report with any secret details removed?
A simple email would be enough.  I haven't seen the internal issue;
hopefully it has more details than are in this patch.

That patch mentions Dell XPS 13, not a Chromebook, so your patch
wouldn't affect it.  Are you saying this issue is common across all
Apollo Lake platforms?  If so, maybe a fix should be more generic?

My point is that there is no PCI requirement for capabilities to be at
0x150 and 0x220.  The only defined way to find these capabilities is
to traverse the list starting at offset 0x100.

The L1SS capability at pdev->l1ss is reasonable since we found it by
traversing that list, but 0x150 and 0x220 are magic numbers with no
justification.  We have no reason to believe there are capabilities
there.

We might know this based on device-specific knowledge of the Root
Port.  If that's the case, please cite the Intel spec for device 5ad6
so we can tell this quirk can't be blindly applied to other Root
Ports.
