Thanks for taking the time to publish these, that helps a lot.

Yes, that's better

Oh good catch, that was easy to miss. I'm surprised I didn't hit
horrible bugs when testing this in qemu.

Agreed, it makes things a lot easier to read and your branch makes
restoring LR and PC more sane too. I squashed your change in and will
send it as part of v2.

Fair enough, I'll add an extra patch for this in v2. It's fairly
simple and if other maintainers think it's too much for the scope of
the series, we can always pick it up later and merge it separately.
