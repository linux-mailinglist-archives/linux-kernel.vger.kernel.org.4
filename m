You are right.

Let me elaborate on this.

We will write down the hardware description via device tree.

Then we will write the driver which will honor that binding.

So the question is what is the best practice there assuming there is no 
shared registers however there is overlapping.

e.g. the EDAC driver needs register 0,1,2,4,5 and refresh-rate needs 
register 3.

If we would only have EDAC driver than we would do IO address mapping 
from 0 with size 5 (not caring mapping register 3 even that its not used).

However, with the other driver (refresh rate) that need register 3 we am 
facing a problem.

So looking for the best solution here.

I don't think this is a problem that is specific to drivers/edac and to 
drivers/memory, however, due to the nature of those two libraries this 
conflict is more expected.
