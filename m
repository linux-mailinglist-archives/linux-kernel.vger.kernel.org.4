The scenario we encountered was this:
```
write:
     ext4_es_insert_delayed_block
     [0/16) 576460752303423487 (U,D)

     -- remove block 11 from extent
       [0/11) 576460752303423487 (U,D,R)  +  (Newly allocated)[12/4) 
549196775151 (U,D,R)
       --Failure to allocate memory for a new extent will undo as:

W: WRITTEN

```

When we fail to allocate a new extent, we don't map buffer and we don't do
io_submit, so why is the extent tree in memory inconsistent with the one
stored on disk? Am I missing something?

I would appreciate it if you could explain under what cases and what kind of
data corruption issues can be caused.

Totally agree!

This solution looks very effective and clear, I will try to implement it.

Thank you very much for your suggestion!

Reloading extent tree from disk I don't quite understand here, how do we 
handle
reserved blocks? could you explain it in more detail?

Logically, I think it is still necessary to update 
i_reserved_data_blocks only after
a successful allocation. This is also done in ext4_ext_map_blocks().

Thanks again!
