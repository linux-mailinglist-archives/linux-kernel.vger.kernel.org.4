Huh, I somehow missed this call to mtrr_disable().  I distinctly remember looking
at this helper, no idea how I missed that.

kexec() allows "booting" into a new kernel without transitioning through BIOS
and without doing a full reboot.  The scenario I'm worried about is if the new
kernel offlines KVM's chosen CPU for whatever reason and also modifies MTRRs.  I
think it's an extremely unlikely scenario, but my point is that selecting a single
vCPU to control the MTRRs works if and only if that vCPU stays online for the
entire lifetime of the VM, which KVM can't guarantee.

Yes, that's the intent.  If the CR0.CD quirk is _disabled_, then all SPTEs are
UC, i.e. there's no need to zap.  If the quirk is enabled (the common case,
unfortunately), then KVM isn't honoring MTRRs, i.e. non-coherent DMA won't function
properly, and so zapping SPTEs is pointless.  And in both cases, KVM will zap
relevant SPTEs when CR0.CD is cleared.

And this is actually already the behavior for all MTRRs execpt for MSR_MTRRdefType
due to the !mtrr_is_enabled() clause below.

Yes, on CR0.CD 1=>0 transition.

I don't think the current code is functionally correct though, even if we define
"correct" to only apply when CR0.CD=0 (because the CR0.CD=1 case when the quirk
can't possibly be correct).  Keeping stale WB+IGMT entries that were installed
while CR0.CD=1 is broken.  As mentioned in my previous mail, I suspect it works
only because KVM doesn't install SPTEs for DMA'd ranges.  FWIW, the WB memtype
is unlikely to be a problem, but setting IGMT definitely is.  Though of course
we can and should fix the IGMT thing separately.

> And pieces of no-WB memory might produce more kvm_zap_gfn_range()?

Yes, but they'll be much, much more precise.  And the bajillion fixed MTRRs can
be batched into a single zap by sacrificing a tiny amount of precision, i.e. zap
from the lowest non-WB fixed MTRR to the highest.  Crucially, assuming BIOS and
the kernel aren't doing something bizarre, that should preserve the SPTEs for the
code the guest is executing from (0 - VGA hole should be WB).

And if we want to squeeze more performance out of this path, there are other
optimizations we can make.  E.g. I'm guessing one of the problems, perhaps even
_the_ problem, is that there's contention on mmu_lock in kvm_zap_gfn_range() when
bringing up APs, which is likely why you observe slow downs even when there are
no SPTEs to zap.  A thought for handling that would be to do something akin to
kvm_recalculate_apic_map().  E.g. instead of having every vCPU zap, track (a)
if a zap is in-progress and (b) the ranges being zapped.  There will still be
lock contention to add ranges, but it should be fairly short in duration compared
to zapping all possible SPTEs (current behavior).

Something like

	struct tbd *range = NULL;
	bool do_zap = false;

	<gather non-wb ranges>

	for_each_non_wb_range(...) {
		if (!range)
			range = kmalloc(...);

		spin_lock(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_lock);
		if (<range not in list>) {
			list_add_tail(&range->list, &kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_list);
			range = NULL;

			if (!kvm->arch.mtrr_zapping) {
				do_zap = true;
				kvm->arch.mtrr_zapping = true;
			}
		}
		spin_unlock(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_lock);
	}

	kfree(zap_entry);

	if (do_zap) {
		spin_lock(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_lock);

		while (!list_empty(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_list)) {
			struct tbd *range;

			range = list_first_entry(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_list);
			list_del(range->list);

			spin_unlock(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_lock);

			kvm_zap_gfn_range(..., range->start, range->end);
			kfree(range);
		
			spin_lock(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_lock);
		}

		/* Clear under lock to ensure new entries are processed. */
		kvm->arch.mtrr_zapping = false;

		spin_unlock(&kvm->arch.mtrr_zap_lock);
	}

	/* Wait for the zap to complete. */
	while (READ_ONCE(kvm->arch.mtrr_zapping))
		cpu_relax();

and I'm sure someone that's better at lockless programming could optimize that
even further if necessary, e.g. by checking for "range in list" outside of the
spinlock.

E.g. in my OVMF based VM, the precise zap would target only two ranges, the VGA
hole and the 32-bit PCI:

  kvm: vCPU0 default type = 6
  kvm: vCPU0 fixed MTRR range 0 - 15 == 6
  kvm: vCPU0 fixed MTRR range 16 - 87 == 0
  kvm: vCPU0 variable MTRR range 80000000 - 100000000  = 0

That bumps up to three ranges for the kernel, which adds what I suspect is the
64-bit PCI hole:

  kvm: vCPU0 default type = 6                                                   
  kvm: vCPU0 fixed MTRR range 0 - 15 == 6                                       
  kvm: vCPU0 fixed MTRR range 16 - 87 == 0
  kvm: vCPU0 variable MTRR range 800000000 - 1000000000  = 0
  kvm: vCPU0 variable MTRR range 80000000 - 100000000  = 0

The above is distilled information from this hack-a-print:
