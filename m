[Leaving the full quote below for reference and adding more appropriate people.]

After a far too long round of git-bisect I narrowed it down to:

  c1c59538337ab6d45700cb4a1c9725e67f59bc6e is the first bad commit

    x86/pat: Fix pat_x_mtrr_type() for MTRR disabled case
    commit 90b926e68f500844dff16b5bcea178dc55cf580a upstream.

And indeed, reverting this single commit from v6.1.8 (stable) makes the 
disks appear again.

TL;DR: with v6.1.8 in Xen Dom0 mode (i.e. the Xen host itself) the 
external disk enclosure attached via USB is not being recognized. When 
booted *without* Xen, the disks show up just fine.

Details with dmesg and lsusb outputs:
  https://nerdbynature.de/bits/usb_v6.1.8/

Thanks Thorsten for the localmodconfig hint, I've tried that before, but 
the thing just did not want to boot, so I manually cut down on options, 
but it's still ~12 minutes per compile, ccache helped a bit in the end.

Thanks for reading,
Christian.
