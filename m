And while that is a fine concept per see, the current incarnation of
that is fundamentally broken is it centered around the controlled
VM.  Which really can't work.

Even then you need a controlling and a controlled entity.  The
controlling entity even in SIOV remains a PCIe function.  The
controlled entity might just be a bunch of hardware resoures and
a PASID.  Making it important again that all migration is driven
by the controlling entity.

Also the whole concept that only VFIO can do live migration is
a little bogus.  With checkpoint and restart it absolutely
does make sense to live migrate a container, and with that
the hardware interface (e.g. nvme controller) assigned to it.

Maybe they should have talked to someone not high on their own
supply before designing this.
