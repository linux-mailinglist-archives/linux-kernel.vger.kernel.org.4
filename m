No, it just seemed odd to move shared swap *unless* it's partially
faulted. But you're right, it's probably not worth the hassle. I'll
cut this down to the page_mapped() check.

The struggle of writing code for Schroedinger's User...

mem_cgroup_move_account() of course! Will fix.

... and edit this down accordingly.

Right, same rules apply there. I only pasted the swap one to make sure
we get aligned on the basic strategy.

Yes.

Yes, the callers of get_mctgt_type*() need to unlock (if target is
passed and the page is returned). It looks straight-forward, they
already have to do put_page().

We could make it conditional on target, which precharge doesn't pass,
but I agree it's likely not worth optimizing that code at this point.

Thanks for taking a look, Hugh, that's excellent input.

I'll finish this patch, rebase the rmap patch on it, and add a new one
to issue a deprecation warning in mem_cgroup_move_charge_write().
