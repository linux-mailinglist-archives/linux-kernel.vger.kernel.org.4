Hi,

Right, I wouldn't recommend drm.throttle as ABI since my idea is to 
enable drivers to do as good job as they individually can. Eg. some may 
be able to be much smarter than simple throttling, or some may start of 
simpler and later gain a better implementation. Some may even have 
differing capability or granularity depending on the GPU model they are 
driving, like in the case of i915.

So even if the RFC shows just a simple i915 implementation, the 
controller itself shouldn't prevent a smarter approach (via exposed 
ABI). And neither this simple i915 implementation works equally well for 
all supported GPU generations! This will be a theme common for many DRM 
drivers.

Secondly, doing this in userspace would require the ability to get some 
sort of an atomic snapshot of the whole tree hierarchy to account for 
changes in layout of the tree and task migrations. Or some retry logic 
with some added ABI fields to enable it.

Even then I think the only thing we would be able to move to userspace 
is the tree-walking logic and that sounds like not that much kernel code 
saved to trade for increased inefficiency.

Yes agreed, and to re-stress out, the ABI as proposed does not preclude 
changing from scanning to charging or whatever. The idea was for it to 
be compatible in concept with the CPU controller and also avoid baking 
in the controlling method to individual drivers.

I don't think precise and guaranteed limits are feasible given the 
heterogeneous nature of DRM driver capabilities, but I also don't think 
sticking an userspace component in the middle is the way to go.

As I have tried to explain in my previous reply, I don't think real time 
charging is feasible. Because frequency of charging events can both be 
too high and too low. Too high that it doesn't bring value apart from 
increased processing times, where it is not useful to send out 
notification at the same rate, and too low in the sense that some sort 
of periodic query would then be needed in every driver implementation to 
enable all classes of GPU clients to be properly handled.

I just don't see any positives to the charging approach in the DRM 
landscape, but for sure see some negatives. (If we ignore the positive 
of it being a more typical approach, but then I think that is not enough 
to outweigh the negatives.)

Yes I am keenly awaiting comments from the DRM colleagues as well.

Tvrtko

P.S. Note that Michal's idea to simplify client tracking is on my TODO 
list. If that works out some patches, the series itself actually, would 
become even simpler.
