Thanks for resurrecting the discussion.

I'm not sure to understand the comment. The question is about decreasing 
the speed of the charge of the battery because the faster it charges the 
warmer it gets. Doing a fast charge is ok, if the phone is for instance 
on a table doing nothing. But if the environment is hot (a car, a 
pocket) or there are other sources of heat on the phone like a game, the 
temperature of the battery could be too high (or the skin temperature). 
In this case we have to balance the heat contribution of the different 
components by reducing their performances. The first knob to act on is 
to reduce the charge speed of the battery by reducing the delivered power.

For that we need a connection between the thermal framework which 
monitors the battery temperature and the power supply to reduce the 
charge speed when it is too hot. This connection is the cooling device.

The cooling devices have opaque values where the min and max cooling 
effect vary depending on the implementation (eg. a fan 0/1, a LCD light 
0/1023).

Here the power supply has yet another unit (uA) to act on and difficult 
to translate to a cooling device discrete numbers (that is my 
understanding).

My suggestion is adding to the power supply the power capping capability 
using the powercap framework and add it to the DTPM nomenclature.

With enough components in DTPM, it will be possible to create a generic 
power cooling device using the unified unit uW with the powercap API.
