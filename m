Can you clarify what you mean by technically wrong? Are you saying that the
current code that does direct dereferencing is buggy?

I previously convinced myself that the potential for the compiler generating
multiple loads was safe because the code in question is under the PTL so there
are no concurrent stores. And we shouldn't see any tearing for the same reason.

That said, if there is concensus that we can just use ptep_get() (==
READ_ONCE()) everywhere, then I agree that would be cleaner. Does anyone object?
