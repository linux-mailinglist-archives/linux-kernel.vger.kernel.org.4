Describe the SIO coprocessor which serves as pretend DMA controller on
recent Apple platforms.

Since the schema mentions a loader preparing the binding appropriately,
here's a PR with the relevant (WIP) loader code, if anyone wants to look:

+title: Apple SIO Coprocessor
+
+description: |
+  SIO is a coprocessor on Apple M1 and later chips (and maybe also on earlier
+  chips). Its role is to offload SPI, UART and DisplayPort audio transfers,
+  being a pretend DMA controller.

+    description: |
+      Parameters in the form of opaque key/value pairs that are to be sent to the SIO
+      coprocesssor once it boots. These parameters can refer to the reserved memory
+      regions described in 'memory-region'.
+
+      Note that unlike Apple's firmware, we treat the parameters, and the data they
+      refer to, as opaque. Apple embed short data blobs into their SIO devicetree node
+      that describe the DMA-enabled peripherals (presumably with defined semantics).
+      Their driver processes those blobs and sets up data structure in mapped device
+      memory, then references this memory in the parameters sent to the SIO. At the
+      level of description we are opting for in this binding, we assume the job of
+      constructing those data structures has been done in advance, leaving behind an
+      opaque list of key/value parameter pairs to be sent by a prospective driver.
+
+      This approach is chosen for two reasons:
+
+       - It means we don't need to try to understand the semantics of Apple's blobs
+         as long as we know the transformation we need to do from Apple's devicetree
+         data to SIO data (which can be shoved away into a loader). It also means the
+         semantics of Apple's blobs (or of something to replace them) need not be part
+         of the binding and be kept up with Apple's firmware changes in the future.
+
+       - It leaves less work for the driver attaching on this binding. Instead the work
+         is done upfront in the loader which can be better suited for keeping up with
+         Apple's firmware changes.
