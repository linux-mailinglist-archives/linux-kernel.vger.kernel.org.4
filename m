What I meant is - if SFrame is implemented by simply extracting unwind info from
DWARF data and placing it in a separate section (as it is probably implemented now),
then what you say is totally true. But if the compiler folks agree to make SFrame reliable,
then either they have to make DWARF reliable. Or, they have to implement SFrame as a
separate feature and make it reliable. The former is tough to do as DWARF has a lot of complexity.
The latter is a lot easier to do.

Sorry if that was not clear.
