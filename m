It seems broken anyway. Please consider the following scenario:

1. A is a tiny cgroup which only does streaming IOs and has memory.high of
   128M which is more than sufficient for IO window. The last file it
   streamed happened to be F which was about 256M.

2. B is an a lot larger cgroup w/ pin limit way above 256M. B pins the
   entirety of F.

3. A now tries to stream another file but F is almost fully occupying its
   memory allowance and can't be evicted. A keeps thrashing due to lack of
   memory and isolation is completely broken.

This stems directly from page ownership and pin accounting discrepancy.

That's a discrepancy in an internal interface and we don't wanna codify
something like that into userspace interface. Semantially, it seems like if
pin_user_pages() wanna charge pinning to the cgroup associated with an fd
(or whatever), it should also claim the ownership of the pages themselves. I
have no idea how feasiable that'd be from memcg POV tho. Given that this
would be a fairly cold path (in most cases, the ownership should already
match), maybe it won't be too bad?

Thanks.
