Ah, there is even v4. I have missed that. The commit message looks
much better there.

I guess that we are talking about different things. Anyway, please
ignore my concern about that it is fragile. The change in
scripts/kallsyms.c does not longer depend on --all-symbols parameter
in the last v4 patchset.

This is another optimization. I agree that we could do it later after
this patchset is accepted.
